# RFF Synthesis

The team has completed RFF response synthesis. Below is a snapshot of the themes of the consolidated feedback.

**1) Problem**

* Simplify the problem statement and provide exemplar submission topics.
* Show an ideal topic or example submission.

**2) Data**

* Acquire, clean, and prepare data either as part of the Challenge or participatory community activities.Data can be used for future activities. 
* Create foundational datasets and hold data “jams.”

**3) Judging**

* Criteria buckets are not mutually exclusive and require further refinement in current form.

**4) Prize**

* Prize competition is the right path but the bigger win is the possibility of community and collaboration for participants interested in this field. Important to create those connections.

**5) Community**

* Provide opportunities to connect with experts, problem owners, users, and other stakeholders along the way. 
* Share information and expertise.
