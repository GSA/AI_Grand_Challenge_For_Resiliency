      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Program description.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Title XIX of the Social Security Act, enacted in 1965, authorizes Federal grants to States for medical assistance to low-income persons who are age 65 or over, blind, disabled, or members of families with dependent children or qualified pregnant women or children. The program is jointly financed by the Federal and State governments and administered by States. Within broad Federal rules, each State decides eligible groups, types and range of services, payment levels for services, and administrative and operating procedures. Payments for services are made directly by the State to the individuals or entities that furnish the services.</P>

              <P>The regulations in subchapter C set forth State plan requirements, standards, procedures, and conditions for obtaining Federal financial participation (FFP). Each part (or subpart of section) in the subchapter describes the specific statutory basis for the regulation. However, where the basis is the Secretary's general authority to issue regulations for any program under the Act (section 1102 of the Act), or his general authority to prescribe State plan requirements needed for proper and efficient administration of the <PRTPAGE P="6"/>plan (section 1902(a)(4)), those statutory provisions are simply cited without further description.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose of waivers.</E> Waivers are intended to provide the flexibility needed to enable States to try new or different approaches to the efficient and cost-effective delivery of health care services, or to adapt their programs to the special needs of particular areas or groups of beneficiaries. Waivers allow exceptions to State plan requirements and permit a State to implement innovative programs or activities on a time-limited basis, and subject to specific safeguards for the protection of beneficiaries and the program. Detailed rules for waivers are set forth in subpart B of part 431, subpart A of part 440, and subpart G of part 441 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of waivers.</E> (1) Waivers under section 1915(b) allow a State to take the following actions:</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Grant award</E>—(1) <E T="03">Computation by CMS.</E> Regional office staff analyzes the State's estimates and sends a recommendation to the central office. Central office staff considers the State's estimates, the regional office recommendations and any other relevant information, including any adjustments to be made under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and computes the grant.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Content of award.</E> The grant award computation form shows the estimate of expenditures for the ensuring quarter, and the amounts by which that estimate is increased or decreased because of an underestimate or overestimate for prior quarters, or for any of the following reasons:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for withholding.</E> CMS withholds payments to the State, in whole or in part, only if, after giving the agency reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subpart D of this part, the Administrator finds—</P>
              <P>(1) That the plan no longer complies with the provisions of section 1902 of the Act; or</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic conditions.</E> When Federal payments have been made for claims that are later found to be unallowable, the State may repay the Federal funds by installments if all of the following conditions are met:</P>

              <P>(1) The amount to be repaid exceeds 0.25 percent of the estimated or actual <PRTPAGE P="16"/>annual State share for the Medicaid program.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Annual State share determination.</E> CMS determines whether the amount to be repaid exceeds 0.25 percent of the annual State share as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Medicaid program is ongoing, CMS uses the annual estimated State share of Medicaid expenditures for the current year, as shown on the State's latest Medicaid Program Budget Report (CMS-37). The current year is the year in which the State requests the repayment by installments.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Medicaid program has been terminated by Federal law or by the State, CMS uses the actual State share that is shown on the State's CMS-64 Quarterly Expense Report for the last four quarters filed.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Extended schedule.</E> (i) The repayment schedule may be extended beyond 12 quarterly installments if the total repayment amount exceeds 100 percent of the estimated State share of the current annual expenditures;</P>

              <P>(6) <E T="03">Reductions.</E> If the State chooses to repay amounts representing higher percentages during the early quarters, any corresponding reduction in required minimum percentages is applied first to the last scheduled payment, then to the next to the last payment, and so forth as necessary.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Repayment schedule.</E> The maximum number of quarters allowed for the alternate repayment schedule is 12 quarters (3 years), except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</P>

              <P>(A) In these circumstances, paragraph (d)(3) of this section is followed for repayment of the amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated State share of current annual expenditures.</P>
              <P>(B) The remaining amount of the repayment is in quarterly amounts equal to 8<FR>1/3</FR> percent of the estimated State share of current annual expenditures until fully repaid.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon request by the State, the repayment schedule may be extended beyond 12 quarterly installments if the State has qualifying periods of economic distress in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section during the first 8 quarters of the alternate repayment schedule.</P>
              <P>(A) To qualify for additional quarters, the States must demonstrate a period of economic distress in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section for at least 1 month of a quarter during the first 8 quarters of the alternate repayment schedule.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory basis.</E> Section 1915(b) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to waive most requirements of section 1902 of the Act to the extent he or she finds proposed improvements or specified practices in the provision of services under Medicaid to be cost effective, efficient, and consistent with the objectives of the Medicaid program. Sections 1915 (f) and (h) prescribe how such waivers are to be approved, continued, monitored, and terminated. Section 1902(p)(2) of the Act conditions FFP in payments to an entity under a section 1915(b)(1) waiver on the State's provision for exclusion of certain entities from participation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) General requirements for submittal of waiver requests, and the procedures that CMS follows for review and action on those requests are set forth in § 430.25 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) In applying for a waiver to implement an approvable project under paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, a Medicaid agency must document in the waiver request and maintain data regarding:</P>
              <P>(i) The cost-effectiveness of the project;</P>
              <P>(ii) The effect of the project on the accessibility and quality of services;</P>
              <P>(iii) The anticipated impact of the project on the State's Medicaid program and;</P>
              <P>(iv) Assurances that the restrictions on free choice of providers do not apply to family planning services.</P>
              <P>(3) No waiver under this section may be granted for a period longer than 2 years, unless the agency requests a continuation of the waiver.</P>
              <P>(4) CMS monitors the implementation of waivers granted under this section to ensure that requirements for such waivers are being met.</P>
              <P>(i) If monitoring demonstrates that the agency is not in compliance with the requirements for a waiver under this section, CMS gives the agency notice and opportunity for a hearing.</P>
              <P>(ii) If, after a hearing, CMS finds an agency to be out of compliance with the requirements of a waiver, CMS terminates the waiver and gives the agency a specified date by which it must demonstrate that it meets the applicable requirements of section 1902 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(5) The requirements of section 1902(s) of the Act, with regard to adjustments in payments for inpatient hospital services furnished to infants who have not attained age 1 and to children who have not attained age 6 and who receive these services in disproportionate share hospitals, may not be waived under a section 1915(b) waiver.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Case-management system.</E> (1) Waivers of appropriate requirements of section 1902 of the Act may be authorized for a State to implement a primary care case-management system or specialty physician services system.</P>
              <P>(i) Under a primary care case-management system the agency assures that a specific person or persons or agency will be responsible for locating, coordinating, and monitoring all primary care or primary care and other medical care and rehabilitative services on behalf of a beneficiary. The person or agency must comply with the requirements set forth in part 438 of this chapter for primary care case management contracts and systems.</P>
              <P>(ii) A specialty physician services system allows States to restrict beneficiaries of specialty services to designated providers of such services, even in the absence of a primary care case-management system.</P>

              <P>(2) A waiver under this paragraph (c) may not be approved unless the State's request assures that the restrictions—<PRTPAGE P="33"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Do not apply in emergency situations; and</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Locality as central broker.</E> Waivers of appropriate requirements of section 1902 of the Act may be authorized for a State to allow a locality to act as a central broker to assist beneficiaries in selecting among competing health care plans. States must ensure that access to medically necessary services of adequate quality is not substantially impaired.</P>
              <P>(1) A locality is any defined jurisdiction, e.g., district, town, city, borough, county, parish, or State.</P>
              <P>(2) A locality may use any agency or agent, public or private, profit or nonprofit, to act on its behalf in carrying out its central broker function.</P>

              <P>(i) Services furnished by a plan selected by the beneficiary; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Services expressly offered by the State as an inducement for beneficiaries to participate in a primary care case-management system, a competing health care plan or other system that furnishes health care services in a more cost-effective manner.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Restriction of freedom of choice</E>—(1) Waiver of appropriate requirements of section 1902 of the Act may be authorized for States to restrict beneficiaries to obtaining services from (or through) qualified providers or practitioners that meet, accept, and comply with the State reimbursement, quality and utilization standards specified in the State's waiver request.</P>
              <P>(2) An agency may qualify for a waiver under this paragraph (f) only if its applicable State standards are consistent with access, quality and efficient and economic provision of covered care and services and the restrictions it imposes—</P>
              <P>(i) Do not apply to beneficiaries residing at a long-term care facility when a restriction is imposed unless the State arranges for reasonable and adequate beneficiary transfer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Do not discriminate among classes of providers on grounds unrelated to their demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency in providing those services; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Do not apply in emergency circumstances.</P>
              <P>(3) Demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency refers to reducing costs or slowing the rate of cost increase and maximizing outputs or outcomes per unit of cost.</P>
              <P>(4) The agency must make payments to providers furnishing services under a freedom of choice waiver under this paragraph (f) in accordance with the timely claims payment standards specified in § 447.45 of this chapter for health care practitioners participating in the Medicaid program.</P>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">Waivers approved under section 1915(b)(1) of the Act</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic rules.</E> (i) An agency must submit, as part of it's waiver request, assurance that the entities described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section will be excluded from participation under an approved waiver.</P>
              <P>(ii) FFP is available in payments to an entity that furnishes services under a section 1915(b)(1) waiver only if the agency excludes from participation any entity described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Entities that must be excluded. The agency must exclude an entity that meets any of the following conditions:</P>

                <P>This subpart establishes State requirements for the Medicaid Eligibility Quality Control (MEQC) Program designed to reduce erroneous expenditures by monitoring eligibility determinations and a claims processing assessment that monitors claims processing operations. MEQC will work in conjunction with the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) Program established in subpart Q of this part. In years in which the State is required to participate in PERM, as stated in subpart Q of this part, it will only participate in the PERM program and will not be required to conduct a MEQC pilot. In the 2 years between PERM cycles, the State is required to conduct a MEQC pilot, as set forth in this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disallowance of Federal financial participation for erroneous State payments (for PERM review years ending after July 1, 2020).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) This section establishes rules and procedures for disallowing Federal financial participation (FFP) in erroneous medical assistance payments due to eligibility improper payment errors, as detected through the PERM program required under this subpart, in effect on and after July 1, 2020.</P>
              <P>(2) After the State's eligibility improper rate has been established for each PERM review period, CMS will compute the amount of the disallowance, removing any underpayments due to eligibility errors, and adjust the FFP payable to each State. The disallowance or withholding is only applicable to the State's PERM year.</P>
              <P>(3) CMS will compute the amount to be withheld or disallowed as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Subtract the 3 percent allowable threshold from the lower limit of the State's eligibility improper payment rate percentage excluding underpayments.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the difference is greater than zero, the Federal medical assistance funds for the period, are multiplied by that percentage. This product is the amount of the disallowance or withholding.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice to States and showing of good faith.</E> (1) If CMS is satisfied that the State did not meet the 3 percent allowable threshold despite a good faith effort, CMS will reduce the funds being disallowed in whole.</P>

              <P>(2) CMS may find that a State did not meet the 3 percent allowable threshold despite a good faith effort if the State has taken the action it believed was needed to meet the threshold, but the <PRTPAGE P="75"/>threshold was not met. CMS will grant a good faith waiver only if the State both:</P>
              <P>(i) Participates in the MEQC pilot program in accordance with §§ 431.800 through 431.820, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Implements PERM CAPs in accordance with § 431.992.</P>
              <P>(3) Each State that has an eligibility improper payment rate above the allowable threshold will be notified by CMS of the amount of the disallowance.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis.</E> Sections 1903(a)(1), 1903(g), 1905(b), 1905(y), and 1905(z) provide for payments to States, on the basis of a Federal medical assistance percentage, for part of their expenditures for services under an approved State plan.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP)</E>—<E T="03">Computations.</E> The FMAP is determined by the formula described in section 1905(b) of the Act. Under the formula, if a State's per capita income <PRTPAGE P="81"/>is equal to the national average per capita income, the Federal share is 55 percent. If a State's per capita income exceeds the national average, the Federal share is lower, with a statutory minimum of 50 percent. If a State's per capita income is lower than the national average, the Federal share is increased, with a statutory maximum of 83 percent. The formula used in determining the State and Federal share is as follows:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">State Share = [(State per capita income) <SU>2</SU>/(National per capita income) <SU>2</SU>] × 45 percent</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Federal share = 100 percent minus the State share (with a minimum of 50 percent and a maximum of 83 percent)</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <FP>The formula provides for squaring both the State and national average per capita incomes; this procedure magnifies any difference between the State's income and the national average. Consequently, Federal matching to lower income States is increased, and Federal matching to higher income States is decreased, within the statutory 50-83 percent limits. The FMAP for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa is set by statute at 50 percent and is subject to dollar limitations specified in section 1108 of the Act.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Special provisions.</E> (1) Under section 1903(a)(5) of the Act, the Federal share of State expenditures for family planning services is 90 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) Under section 1905(b), the Federal share of State expenditures for services provided through Indian Health Service facilities is 100 percent.</P>
              <P>(3) Under section 1903(g), the FMAP is reduced if the State does not have an effective program to control use of institutional services.</P>
              <P>(4) Under section 1905(b) of the Social Security Act, the Federal share of State expenditures described in § 433.11(a) for services provided to children, is the enhanced FMAP rate determined in accordance with § 457.622(b) of this chapter, subject to the conditions explained in § 433.11(b).</P>
              <P>(5)(i) Under section 1933(d) of the Act, the Federal share of State expenditures for Medicare Part B premiums described in section 1905(p)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act on behalf of Qualifying Individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(E)(iv) of the Act, is 100 percent, to the extent that the assistance does not exceed the State's allocation under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. To the extent that the assistance exceeds that allocation, the Federal share is 0 percent.</P>
              <P>(ii) Under section 1933(c)(2) of the Act and subject to paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, the allocation to each State is equal to the total allocation specified in section 1933(g) of the Act multiplied by the Secretary's estimate of the ratio of the total number of individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(E)(iv) of the Act in the State to the total number of individuals described in section 1902(a)(10)(E)(iv) of the Act for all eligible States. In estimating that ratio, the Secretary will use data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</P>
              <P>(iii) If, based on projected expenditures for a fiscal year, or for a shorter period for which funding is available under section 1933 of the Act, the Secretary determines that the expenditures described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section for one or more States are projected to exceed the allocation made to the State, the Secretary may adjust each State's fiscal year allocation, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The Secretary will compare each State's projected total expenditures for the expenses described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section to the State's initial allocation determined under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, to determine the extent of each State's projected surplus or deficit.</P>
              <P>(B) The surplus of each State with a projected surplus, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) of this section will be added together to arrive at the Total Projected Surplus.</P>
              <P>(C) The deficit of each State with a projected deficit, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) of this section will be added together to arrive at the Total Projected Deficit.</P>

              <P>(D) Each State with a projected deficit will receive an additional allocation equal to the amount of its projected deficit, or a prorated amount of such deficit, if the Total Projected Deficit is greater than the Total Projected <PRTPAGE P="82"/>Surplus. Except as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(E) of this section, the amount to be reallocated from each State with a projected surplus will be equal to A × B, where A equals the Total Projected Deficit and B equals the amount of the State's projected surplus as a percentage of the Total Projected Surplus.</P>
              <P>(E) If the Total Projected Deficit determined under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(C) of this section is greater than the Total Projected Surplus determined under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, each State with a projected deficit will receive an additional allocation amount equal to the amount of the Total Projected Surplus multiplied by the amount of the projected deficit for such State as a percentage of the Total Projected Deficit. The amount to be reallocated from each State with a projected surplus will be equal to the amount of the projected surplus.</P>
              <P>(iv) CMS will notify States of any changes in allotments resulting from any reallocations.</P>
              <P>(v) The provisions in paragraph (c)(5) of this section will be in effect through the end of the period for which funding authority is available under section 1933 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(6)(i) <E T="03">Newly eligible FMAP.</E> Beginning January 1, 2014, under section 1905(y) of the Act, the FMAP for a State that is one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia, including a State that meets the definition of expansion State in § 433.204(b), for amounts expended by such State for medical assistance for newly eligible individuals, as defined in § 433.204(a)(1), will be an increased FMAP equal to:</P>

              <P>(E) 90 percent, for calendar quarters in CY 2020 and all subsequent calendar years.</P>
              <P>(ii) The FMAP specified in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section will apply to amounts expended by a State for medical assistance for newly eligible individuals in accordance with the requirements of the methodology applied by the State under § 433.206.</P>
              <P>(7)(i) <E T="03">Temporary FMAP increase.</E> During the period January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2015, under section 1905(z)(1) of the Act for a State described in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, the FMAP determined under paragraph (b) of this section will be increased by 2.2 percentage points.</P>
              <P>(ii) A State qualifies for the targeted increase in the FMAP under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, if the State:</P>
              <P>(A) Is an expansion State, as described in § 433.204(b) of this section;</P>
              <P>(B) Does not qualify for any payments on the basis of the increased FMAP under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, as determined by the Secretary; and</P>
              <P>(C) Has not been approved by the Secretary to divert a portion of the disproportionate share hospital allotment for the State under section 1923(f) of the Act to the costs of providing medical assistance or other health benefits coverage under a demonstration that is in effect on July 1, 2009.</P>
              <P>(iii) The increased FMAP under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section is available for amounts expended by the State for medical assistance for individuals that are not newly eligible as defined in § 433.204(a)(1).</P>

The notice to the individual must explain what is meant by the term lien, and that imposing a lien does not mean that the individual will lose ownership of the home.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The State plan must define the following terms used in this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Individual's home.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exception.</E> The State plan must specify the criteria by which a son or daughter can establish to the agency's satisfaction that he or she has been providing care which permitted the individual to reside at home rather than in an institution, as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Lien provisions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Incorrect payments.</E> The agency may place a lien against an individual's property, both personal and real, before his or her death because of Medicaid claims paid or to be paid on behalf of that individual following a court judgement which determined that benefits were incorrectly paid for that individual.</P>

              <P>(ii) The agency determines that he or she cannot reasonably be expected to be discharged and return home.

              <P>(ii) The individual's child who is under age 21 or blind or disabled as defined in the State plan; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The individual's sibling (who has an equity interest in the home, and who was residing in the individual's home for at least one year immediately before the date the individual was admitted to the medical institution).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Termination of lien.</E> Any lien imposed on an individual's real property under paragraph (g)(2) of this section <PRTPAGE P="86"/>will dissolve when that individual is discharged from the medical institution and returns home.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis and scope.</E> This section is based on section 1903(d)(5) of the Act, which requires that the Secretary charge a State interest on the Federal share of claims that have been disallowed but have been retained by the State during the administrative appeals process under section 1116(e) of the Act and the Secretary later recovers after the administrative appeals process has been completed. This section does not apply to—</P>

              <SUBJECT>Treatment of uncashed or cancelled (voided) Medicaid checks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section provides the rules to ensure that States refund the Federal portion of uncashed or cancelled (voided) checks under title XIX.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section—</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Cancelled (voided) check</E> means a Medicaid check issued by a State or fiscal agent which prior to its being cashed is cancelled (voided) by the State or fiscal agent, thus preventing disbursement of funds.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Check</E> means a check or warrant that a State or local agency uses to make a payment.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Fiscal agent</E> means an entity that processes or pays vendor claims for the Medicaid State agency.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Uncashed check</E> means a Medicaid check issued by a State or fiscal agent which has not been cashed by the payee.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Warrant</E> means an order by which the State agency or local agency without the authority to issue checks recognizes a claim. Presentation of a warrant by the payee to a State officer with authority to issue checks will result in release of funds due.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Refund of Federal financial participation (FFP) for uncashed checks</E>—(1) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> If a check remains uncashed beyond a period of 180 days from the date it was issued; i.e., the date of the check, it will no longer be regarded as an allowable program expenditure. If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of the uncashed check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Report of refund.</E> At the end of each calendar quarter, the State must identify those checks which remain uncashed beyond a period of 180 days after issuance. The State agency must refund all FFP that it received for uncashed checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter. If an uncashed check is cashed after the refund is made, the State may file a claim. The claim will be considered to be an adjustment to the costs for the quarter in which the check was originally claimed. This claim will be paid if otherwise allowed by the Act and the regulations issued pursuant to the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Refund of FFP for cancelled (voided) checks</E>—(1) <E T="03">General provision.</E> If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of a cancelled (voided) check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Report of refund.</E> At the end of each calendar quarter, the State agency must identify those checks which were cancelled (voided). The State must refund all FFP that it received for cancelled (voided) checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter.</P>
              <P>(3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Entity related to a health care provider</E> means—</P>
              <P>(1) An organization, association, corporation, or partnership formed by or on behalf of a health care provider;</P>
              <P>(2) An individual with an ownership or control interest in the provider, as defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act;</P>
              <P>(3) An employee, spouse, parent, child, or sibling of the provider, or of a person with an ownership or control interest in the provider, as defined in section 1124(a)(3) of the Act; or</P>
              <P>(4) A supplier of health care items or services or a supplier to providers of health care items or services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Health care provider</E> means the individual or entity that receives any payment or payments for health care items or services provided.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Provider-related donation</E> means a donation or other voluntary payment (in cash or in kind) made directly or indirectly to a State or unit of local government by or on behalf of a health care provider, an entity related to such a health care provider, or an entity providing goods or services to the State for administration of the State's Medicaid plan.</P>

              <P>(1) Donations made by a health care provider to an organization, which in turn donates money to the State, may <PRTPAGE P="90"/>be considered to be a donation made indirectly to the State by a health care provider.</P>
              <P>(2) When an organization receives less than 25 percent of its revenues from providers and/or provider-related entities, its donations will not generally be presumed to be provider-related donations. Under these circumstances, a provider-related donation to an organization will not be considered a donation made indirectly to the State. However, if the donations from providers to an organization are subsequently determined to be indirect donations to the State or unit of local government for administration of the State's Medicaid program, then such donations will be considered to be health care related.</P>
              <P>(3) When the organization receives more than 25 percent of its revenue from donations from providers or provider-related entities, the organization always will be considered as acting on behalf of health care providers if it makes a donation to the State. The amount of the organization's donation to the State, in a State fiscal year, that will be considered health care related, will be based on the percentage of donations the organization received from the providers during that period.</P>

              <P>(1) The health care provider;</P>
              <P>(2) Any related entity providing health care items and services; or</P>
              <P>(3) Other providers furnishing the same class of items or services as the provider or entity.</P>
              <P>(b) Provider-related donations will be determined to have no direct or indirect relationship to Medicaid payments if those donations are not returned to the individual provider, the provider class, or related entity under a hold harmless provision or practice, as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) A hold harmless practice exists if any of the following applies:</P>
              <P>(1) The State (or other unit of government) provides for a direct or indirect non-Medicaid payment to those providers or others making, or responsible for, the donation, and the payment amount is positively correlated to the donation. A positive correlation includes any positive relationship between these variables, even if not consistent over time.</P>
              <P>(2) All or any portion of the Medicaid payment to the donor, provider class, or related entity, varies based only on the amount of the donation, including where Medicaid payment is conditional on receipt of the donation.</P>
              <P>(3) The State (or other unit of government) receiving the donation provides for any direct or indirect payment, offset, or waiver such that the provision of that payment, offset, or waiver directly or indirectly guarantees to return any portion of the donation to the provider (or other parties responsible for the donation).</P>
              <P>(d) CMS will presume provider-related donations to be bona fide if the voluntary payments, including, but not limited to, gifts, contributions, presentations or awards, made by or on behalf of individual health care providers to the State, county, or any other unit of local government does not exceed—</P>

              <P>(1) $5,000 per year in the case of an individual provider donation; or<PRTPAGE P="91"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) $50,000 per year in the case of a donation from any health care organizational entity.</P>
              <P>(e) To the extent that a donation presumed to be bona fide contains a hold harmless provision, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, it will not be considered a bona fide donation. When provider-related donations are not bona fide, CMS will deduct this amount from the State's medical assistance expenditures before calculating FFP. This offset will apply to all years the State received such donations and any subsequent fiscal year in which a similar donation is received.</P>

Direct costs of outstationed eligibility workers refers to the costs of training, salaries and fringe benefits associated with each outstationed worker and similar allocated costs of State or local agency support staff, and a prorated cost of outreach activities applicable to the outstationed workers at these sites.

              <SUBJECT>Permissible health care-related taxes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A State may receive health care-related taxes, without a reduction in FFP, only in accordance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Permissible health care-related taxes.</E> Subject to the limitations specified in § 433.70, a State may receive, without a reduction in FFP, health care-related taxes if all of the following are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The taxes are broad based, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) The taxes are uniformly imposed throughout a jurisdiction, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(3) The tax program does not violate the hold harmless provisions specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Broad based health care-related taxes.</E> (1) A health care-related tax will be considered to be broad based if the tax is imposed on at least all health care items or services in the class or providers of such items or services furnished by all non-Federal, non-public providers in the State, and is imposed uniformly, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If a health care-related tax is imposed by a unit of local government, the tax must extend to all items or services or providers (or to all providers in a class) in the area over which the unit of government has jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(3) A State may request a waiver from CMS of the requirement that a tax program be broad based, in accordance with the procedures specified in § 433.72. Waivers from the uniform and broad-based requirements will automatically be granted in cases of variations in licensing and certification fees for providers if the amount of such fees is not more than $1,000 annually per provider and the total amount raised by the State from the fees is used in the administration of the licensing or certification program.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Uniformly imposed health care-related taxes.</E> A health care-related tax will be considered to be imposed uniformly even if it excludes Medicaid or Medicare payments (in whole or in part), or both; or, in the case of a health care-related tax based on revenues or receipts with respect to a class of items or services (or providers of items or services), if it excludes either Medicaid or Medicare revenues with respect to a class of items or services, or both. The exclusion of Medicaid revenues must be applied uniformly to all providers being taxed.</P>
              <P>(1) A health care-related tax will be considered to be imposed uniformly if it meets any one of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) If the tax is a licensing fee or similar tax imposed on a class of health care services (or providers of those health care items or services), the tax is the same amount for every provider furnishing those items or services within the class.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the tax is a licensing fee or similar tax imposed on a class of health care items or services (or providers of those items or services) on the basis of the number of beds (licensed or otherwise) of the provider, the amount of the tax is the same for each bed of each provider of those items or services in the class.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the tax is imposed on provider revenue or receipts with respect to a class of items or services (or providers of those health care items or services), the tax is imposed at a uniform rate for all services (or providers of those items or services) in the class on all the gross <PRTPAGE P="94"/>revenues or receipts, or on net operating revenues relating to the provision of all items or services in the State, unit, or jurisdiction. Net operating revenue means gross charges of facilities less any deducted amounts for bad debts, charity care, and payer discounts.</P>
              <P>(iv) The tax is imposed on items or services on a basis other than those specified in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section, e.g., an admission tax, and the State establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the amount of the tax is the same for each provider of such items or services in the class.</P>
              <P>(2) A tax imposed with respect to a class of health care items or services will not be considered to be imposed uniformly if it meets either one of the following two criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The tax provides for credits, exclusions, or deductions which have as its purpose, or results in, the return to providers of all, or a portion, of the tax paid, and it results, directly or indirectly, in a tax program in which—</P>
              <P>(A) The net impact of the tax and payments is not generally redistributive, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(B) The amount of the tax is directly correlated to payments under the Medicaid program.</P>
              <P>(ii) The tax holds taxpayers harmless for the cost of the tax, as described in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If a tax does not meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, but the State establishes that the tax is imposed uniformly in accordance with the procedures for a waiver specified in § 433.72, the tax will be treated as a uniform tax.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Generally redistributive.</E> A tax will be considered to be generally redistributive if it meets the requirements of this paragraph. If the State desires waiver of only the broad-based tax requirement, it must demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If the State desires waiver of the uniform tax requirement, whether or not the tax is broad-based, it must demonstrate compliance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Waiver of broad-based requirement only.</E> This test is applied on a per class basis to a tax that is imposed on all revenues but excludes certain providers. For example, a tax that is imposed on all revenues (including Medicare and Medicaid) but excludes teaching hospitals would have to meet this test. This test cannot be used when a State excludes any or all Medicaid revenue from its tax in addition to the exclusion of providers, since the test compares the proportion of Medicaid revenue being taxed under the proposed tax with the proportion of Medicaid revenue being taxed under a broad-based tax.</P>
              <P>(i) A State seeking waiver of the broad-based tax requirement only must demonstrate that its proposed tax plan meets the requirement that its plan is generally redistributive by:</P>
              <P>(A) Calculating the proportion of the tax revenue applicable to Medicaid if the tax were broad based and applied to all providers or activities within the class (called P1);</P>
              <P>(B) Calculating the proportion of the tax revenue applicable to Medicaid under the tax program for which the State seeks a waiver (called P2); and</P>
              <P>(C) Calculating the value of P1/P2.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the value of P1/P2 is at least 1, CMS will automatically approve the waiver request.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a tax is enacted and in effect prior to August 13, 1993, and the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the value of P1/P2 is at least 0.90, CMS will review the waiver request. Such a waiver will be approved only if the following two criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(A) The value of P1/P2 is at least 0.90; and</P>
              <P>(B) The tax excludes or provides credits or deductions only to one or more of the following providers of items and services within the class to be taxed:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Providers that furnish no services within the class in the State;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Providers that do not charge for services within the class;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Rural hospitals (defined as any hospital located outside of an urban area as defined in § 412.62(f)(1)(ii) of this chapter);<PRTPAGE P="95"/>

              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Financially distressed hospitals if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) A financially distressed hospital is defined by the State law;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The State law specifies reasonable standards for determining financially distressed hospitals, and these standards are applied uniformly to all hospitals in the State; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) No more than 10 percent of nonpublic hospitals in the State are exempt from the tax;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Psychiatric hospitals; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Hospitals owned and operated by HMOs.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a tax is enacted and in effect after August 13, 1993, and the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the value of P1/P2 is at least 0.95, CMS will review the waiver request. Such a waiver request will be approved only if the following two criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(A) The value of P1/P2 is at least 0.95; and</P>
              <P>(B) The tax complies with the provisions of § 433.68(e)(1)(iii)(B).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Waiver of uniform tax requirement.</E> This test is applied on a per class basis to all taxes that are not uniform. This includes those taxes that are neither broad based (as specified in § 433.68(c)) nor uniform (as specified in § 433.68(d)).</P>
              <P>(i) A State seeking waiver of the uniform tax requirement (whether or not the tax is broad based) must demonstrate that its proposed tax plan meets the requirement that its plan is generally redistributive by:</P>

              <P>(A) Calculating, using ordinary least squares, the slope (designated as (<E T="03">B</E>) (that is. the value of the x coefficient) of two linear regressions, in which the dependent variable is each provider's percentage share of the total tax paid by all taxpayers during a 12-month period, and the independent variable is the taxpayer's “Medicaid Statistic”. The term “Medicaid Statistic” means the number of the provider's taxable units applicable to the Medicaid program during a 12-month period. If, for example, the State imposed a tax based on provider charges, the amount of a provider's Medicaid charges paid during a 12-month period would be its “Medicaid Statistic”. If the tax were based on provider inpatient days, the number of the provider's Medicaid days during a 12-month period would be its “Medicaid Statistic”. For the purpose of this test, it is not relevant that a tax program exempts Medicaid from the tax.</P>
              <P>(B) Calculating the slope (designated as B1) of the linear regression, as described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, for the State's tax program, if it were broad based and uniform.</P>
              <P>(C) Calculating the slope (designated as B2) of the linear regression, as described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, for the State's tax program, as proposed.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the value of B1/B2 is at least 1, CMS will automatically approve the waiver request.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the value of B1/B2 is at least 0.95, CMS will review the waiver request. Such a waiver will be approved only if the following two criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(A) The value of B1/B2 is at least 0.95; and</P>
              <P>(B) The tax excludes or provides credits or deductions only to one or more of the following providers of items and services within the class to be taxes:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Providers that furnish no services within the class in the State;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Providers that do not charge for services within the class;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Rural hospitals (defined as any hospital located outside of an urban area as defined in § 412.62(f)(1)(ii) of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Sole community hospitals as defined in § 412.92(a) of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Physicians practicing primarily in medically underserved areas as defined in section 1302(7) of the Public Health Service Act;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Financially distressed hospitals if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) A financially distressed hospital is defined by the State law;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The State law specifies reasonable standards for determining financially distressed hospitals, and these standards are applied uniformly to all hospitals in the State; and<PRTPAGE P="96"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) No more than 10 percent of nonpublic hospitals in the State are exempt from the tax;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Psychiatric hospitals; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Providers or payers with tax rates that vary based exclusively on regions, but only if the regional variations are coterminous with preexisting political (and not special purpose) boundaries. Taxes within each regional boundary must meet the broad-based and uniformity requirements as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) A B1/B2 value of 0.70 will be applied to taxes that vary based exclusively on regional variations, and enacted and in effect prior to November 24, 1992, to permit such variations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Hold harmless.</E> A taxpayer will be considered to be held harmless under a tax program if any of the following conditions applies:</P>
              <P>(1) The State (or other unit of government) imposing the tax provides for a direct or indirect non-Medicaid payment to those providers or others paying the tax and the payment amount is positively correlated to either the tax amount or to the difference between the Medicaid payment and the tax amount. A positive correlation includes any positive relationship between these variables, even if not consistent over time.</P>
              <P>(2) All or any portion of the Medicaid payment to the taxpayer varies based only on the tax amount, including where Medicaid payment is conditional on receipt of the tax amount.</P>
              <P>(3) The State (or other unit of government) imposing the tax provides for any direct or indirect payment, offset, or waiver such that the provision of that payment, offset, or waiver directly or indirectly guarantees to hold taxpayers harmless for all or any portion of the tax amount.</P>
              <P>(i)(A) An indirect guarantee will be determined to exist under a two prong “guarantee” test. If the health care-related tax or taxes on each health care class are applied at a rate that produces revenues less than or equal to 6 percent of the revenues received by the taxpayer, the tax or taxes are permissible under this test. The phrase “revenues received by the taxpayer” refers to the net patient revenue attributable to the assessed permissible class of health care items or services. However, for the period of January 1, 2008 through September 30, 2011, the applicable percentage of net patient service revenue is 5.5 percent. Compliance in State fiscal year 2008 will be evaluated from January 1, 2008 through the last day of State fiscal year 2008. Beginning with State fiscal year 2009 the 5.5 percent tax collection will be measured on an annual State fiscal year basis.</P>
              <P>(B) When the tax or taxes produce revenues in excess of the applicable percentage of the revenue received by the taxpayer, CMS will consider an indirect hold harmless provision to exist if 75 percent or more of the taxpayers in the class receive 75 percent or more of their total tax costs back in enhanced Medicaid payments or other State payments. The second prong of the indirect hold harmless test is applied in the aggregate to all health care taxes applied to each class. If this standard is violated, the amount of tax revenue to be offset from medical assistance expenditures is the total amount of the taxpayers' revenues received by the State.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Good cause.</E> If CMS determines that good cause existed, CMS will waive the FFP reduction attributable to those items for which the good cause existed. A waiver of FFP consequences of the failure to meet the conditions of approval or reapproval based upon good cause will not extend beyond two consecutive quarters.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Circumstances beyond the control of a State.</E> The State must satisfactorily explain the circumstances that are beyond its control. When CMS grants the waiver, CMS will also defer all other system deadlines for the same length of time that the waiver applies.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver of deadline.</E> In no case will CMS waive the December 31, 2015 deadlines referenced in § 433.112(c) and § 433.116(j).</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Obtaining health insurance information: Initial application and redetermination processes for Medicaid eligibility.</E> (1) If the Medicaid agency determines eligibility for Medicaid, it must, during the initial application and each redetermination process, obtain from the applicant or beneficiary such health insurance information as would be useful in identifying legally liable third party resources so that the agency may process claims under the third party liability payment procedures specified in <PRTPAGE P="105"/>§ 433.139 (b) through (f). Health insurance information may include, but is not limited to, the name of the policy holder, his or her relationship to the applicant or beneficiary, the social security number (SSN) of the policy holder, and the name and address of insurance company and policy number.</P>
              <P>(2) If Medicaid eligibility is determined by the Federal agency administering the supplemental security income program under title XVI in accordance with a written agreement under section 1634 of the Act, the Medicaid agency must take the following action. It must enter into an agreement with CMS or must have, prior to February 1, 1985, executed a modified section 1634 agreement that is still in effect to provide for—</P>
              <P>(i) Collection, from the applicant or beneficiary during the initial application and each redetermination process, of health insurance information in the form and manner specified by the Secretary; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Transmittal of the information to the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(3) If Medicaid eligibility is determined by any other agency in accordance with a written agreement, the Medicaid agency must modify the agreement to provide for—</P>
              <P>(i) Collection, from the applicant or beneficiary during the initial application and each redetermination process, of such health insurance information as would be useful in identifying legally liable third party resources so that the Medicaid agency may process claims under the third party liability payment procedures specified in § 433.139 (b) through (f). Health insurance information may include, but is not limited to, those elements described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exchange of data.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, to obtain and use information for the purpose of determining the legal liability of the third parties so that the agency may process claims under the third party liability payment procedures specified in § 433.139(b) through (f), the agency must take the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as part of the data exchange requirements under § 435.945 of this chapter, from the State wage information collection agency (SWICA) defined in § 435.4 of this chapter and from the SSA wage and earnings files data as specified in § 435.948(a)(1) of this chapter, the agency must—</P>

              <P>(ii) Obtain and use, if their names and SSNs are available to the agency under paragraph (c) of this section, information that identifies employed absent or custodial parents of beneficiaries and their employer(s).</P>
              <P>(2) If the agency can demonstrate to CMS that it has an alternate source of information that furnishes information as timely, complete and useful as the SWICA and SSA wage and earnings files in determining the legal liability of third parties, the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are deemed to be met.</P>
              <P>(3) The agency must request, as required under § 435.948(a)(2) of this chapter, from the State title IV-A agency, information not previously reported that identifies those Medicaid beneficiaries who are employed and their employer(s).</P>

However, if the State is not meeting the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section because it has been granted a waiver of those provisions under paragraph (l) of this section, it is not required to provide the reports required in this paragraph.</P>

The portion of the plan which is integrated with MMIS is monitored in accordance with those conditions and if the conditions are not met; it is subject to FFP reduction in accordance with procedures set forth in § 433.120. The State is not subject to any other penalty as a result of other monitoring, quality control, or auditing requirements for those items in the action plan.</P>

              <P>(4) The agency must submit its action plan to the CMS Regional Office within 120 days from the date CMS issues implementing instructions for the State Medicaid Manual. If a State does not have an approved MMIS on the date of issuance of the State Medicaid Manual but subsequently implements an MMIS, the State must submit its action plan within 90 days from the date the system is operational. The <PRTPAGE P="108"/>CMS Regional Office approves or disapproves the action plan.</P>

An activity would not be cost-effective if the cost of the required activity exceeds the third party liability recoupment and the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher cost, the same objective as another activity that is being performed by the State.</P>
              <P>(i) The agency must submit a request for waiver of the requirement in writing to the CMS regional office.</P>
              <P>(ii) The request must contain adequate documentation to establish that to meet a requirement specified by the agency is not cost-effective. Examples of documentation are claims recovery data and a State analysis documenting a cost-effective alternative that accomplished the same task.</P>
              <P>(iii) The agency must agree, if a waiver is granted, to notify CMS of any event that occurs that changes the conditions upon which the waiver was approved.</P>
              <P>(2) CMS will review a State's request to have a requirement specified under paragraph (l)(1) of this section waived and will request additional information from the State, if necessary. CMS will notify the State of its approval or disapproval determination within 30 days of receipt of a properly documented request.</P>
              <P>(3) CMS may rescind a waiver at any time that it determines that the agency no longer meets the criteria for approving the waiver. If the waiver is rescinded, the agency has 6 months from the date of the rescission notice to meet the requirement that had been waived.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic provisions.</E> (1) For claims involving third party liability that are processed on or after May 12, 1986, the agency must use the procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The agency must submit documentation of the methods (e.g., cost avoidance, pay and recover later) it uses for payment of claims involving third party liability to the CMS Regional Office.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Probable liability is established at the time claim is filed.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section—</P>
              <P>(1) If the agency has established the probable existence of third party liability at the time the claim is filed, the agency must reject the claim and return it to the provider for a determination of the amount of liability. The establishment of third party liability takes place when the agency receives confirmation from the provider or a third party resource indicating the extent of third party liability. When the amount of liability is determined, the agency must then pay the claim to the extent that payment allowed under the agency's payment schedule exceeds the amount of the third party's payment.</P>
              <P>(2) The agency may pay the full amount allowed under the agency's payment schedule for the claim and then seek reimbursement from any liable third party to the limit of legal liability if the claim is for labor and delivery and postpartum care. (Costs associated with the inpatient hospital stay for labor and delivery and postpartum care must be cost-avoided.)</P>
              <P>(3) The agency must pay the full amount allowed under the agency's payment schedule for the claim and seek reimbursement from any liable third party to the limit of legal liability (and for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, from a third party, if the third party liability is derived from an absent parent whose obligation to pay support is being enforced by the State title IV-D agency), consistent with paragraph (f) of this section if—</P>

              <P>(i) The claim is prenatal care for pregnant women, or preventive pediatric services (including early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment services provided for under part 441, subpart B of this chapter), that is covered under the State plan; or<PRTPAGE P="109"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The claim is for a service covered under the State plan that is provided to an individual on whose behalf child support enforcement is being carried out by the State title IV-D agency. The agency prior to making any payment under this section must assure that the following requirements are met:</P>
              <P>(A) The State plan specifies whether or not providers are required to bill the third party.</P>
              <P>(B) The provider certifies that before billing Medicaid, if the provider has billed a third party, the provider has waited 30 days from the date of the service and has not received payment from the third party.</P>
              <P>(C) The State plan specifies the method used in determining the provider's compliance with the billing requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Probable liability is not established or benefits are not available at the time claim is filed.</E> If the probable existence of third party liability cannot be established or third party benefits are not available to pay the beneficiary's medical expenses at the time the claim is filed, the agency must pay the full amount allowed under the agency's payment schedule.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Recovery of reimbursement.</E> (1) If the agency has an approved waiver under paragraph (e) of this section to pay a claim in which the probable existence of third party liability has been established and then seek reimbursement, the agency must seek recovery of reimbursement from the third party to the limit of legal liability within 60 days after the end of the month in which payment is made unless the agency has a waiver of the 60-day requirement under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if the agency learns of the existence of a liable third party after a claim is paid, or benefits become available from a third party after a claim is paid, the agency must seek recovery of reimbursement within 60 days after the end of the month it learns of the existence of the liable third party or benefits become available.</P>
              <P>(3) Reimbursement must be sought unless the agency determines that recovery would not be cost effective in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver of requirements.</E> (1) The agency may request initial and continuing waiver of the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (d)(1), and (d)(2) of this section, if it determines that the requirement is not cost-effective. An activity would not be cost-effective if the cost of the required activity exceeds the third party liability recoupment and the required activity accomplishes, at the same or at a higher cost, the same objective as another activity that is being performed by the State.</P>
              <P>(i) The agency must submit a request for waiver of the requirement in writing to the CMS regional office.</P>
              <P>(ii) The request must contain adequate documentation to establish that to meet a requirement specified by the agency is not cost-effective. Examples of documentation are costs associated with billing, claims recovery data, and a State analysis documenting a cost-effective alternative that accomplishes the same task.</P>
              <P>(iii) The agency must agree, if a waiver is granted, to notify CMS of any event that occurs that changes the conditions upon which the waiver was approved.</P>
              <P>(2) CMS will review a State's request to have a requirement specified under paragraph (e)(1) of this section waived and will request additional information from the State, if necessary. CMS will notify the State of its approval or disapproval determination within 30 days of receipt of a properly documented request.</P>
              <P>(3) CMS may rescind the waiver at any time that it determines that the State no longer meets the criteria for approving the waiver. If the waiver is rescinded, the agency has 6 months from the date of the rescission notice to meet the requirement that had been waived.</P>

              <P>(4) An agency requesting a waiver of the requirements specifically concerning either the 60-day limit in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section must submit documentation of written agreement between the agency and the third party, including Medicare fiscal <PRTPAGE P="110"/>intermediaries and carriers, that extension of the billing requirement is agreeable to all parties.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Suspension or termination of recovery of reimbursement.</E> (1) An agency must seek reimbursement from a liable third party on all claims for which it determines that the amount it reasonably expects to recover will be greater than the cost of recovery. Recovery efforts may be suspended or terminated only if they are not cost effective.</P>
              <P>(2) The State plan must specify the threshold amount or other guideline that the agency uses in determining whether to seek recovery of reimbursement from a liable third party, or describe the process by which the agency determines that seeking recovery of reimbursement would not be cost effective.</P>
              <P>(3) The State plan must also specify the dollar amount or period of time for which it will accumulate billings with respect to a particular liable third party in making the decision whether to seek recovery of reimbursement.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Full benefits</E> means, for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with respect to an adult individual, medical assistance for all services covered under the State plan under Title XIX of the Act that is not less in amount, duration, or scope, or is determined by the Secretary to be substantially equivalent, to the medical assistance available for an individual described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of establishing under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section whether an individual would not have been eligible for full benefits, benchmark coverage, or benchmark equivalent coverage under a waiver or demonstration program in effect on December 1, 2009, the State must provide CMS with its analysis, in accordance with guidance issued by CMS, about whether the benefits available under such waiver or demonstration constituted full benefits, benchmark coverage, or benchmark equivalent coverage. CMS will review such analysis and confirm the applicable FMAP. Individuals for whom such benefits or coverage would have been available under such waiver or demonstration are not newly eligible individuals.</P>

A State that offers health benefits coverage to only parents or only nonpregnant childless adults described in the preceding sentence will not be considered to be an expansion State. Such health benefits coverage must:</P>
              <P>(i) Have included inpatient hospital services;<PRTPAGE P="114"/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> Effective January 1, 2014, States must apply the threshold methodology described in this paragraph for purposes of determining the appropriate claiming for the Federal share of expenditures at the applicable FMAP rates described in § 433.10(b) and (c) for medical assistance provided with respect to individuals who have been determined eligible for the Medicaid program under § 435.119 of this chapter. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, States must apply the CMS-approved State specific threshold methodology to determine and distinguish such individuals as newly or not newly eligible individuals in accordance with the definition in § 433.204(a)(1), and in accordance with States' Medicaid eligibility criteria as in effect on December 1, 2009 and to attribute their associated medical expenditures with the appropriate FMAP. The threshold methodology must not be applied by States for the purpose of determining the applicable FMAP for individuals under any other eligibility category other than § 435.119 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General principles.</E> The threshold methodology should:</P>
              <P>(1) Not impact the timing or approval of an individual's eligibility for Medicaid.</P>
              <P>(2) Not be biased in such a manner as to inappropriately establish the numbers of, or medical assistance expenditures for, individuals determined to be newly or not newly eligible.</P>
              <P>(3) Provide a valid and accurate accounting of individuals who would have been eligible in accordance with the December 1, 2009 eligibility standards and applicable eligibility categories for the benefits described in § 433.204(a)(1), and subject to paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of this section, by incorporating simplified assessments of resources, enrollment cap requirements in place at that time, and other special circumstances as approved by CMS, respectively.</P>
              <P>(4) Operate efficiently, without further review once an individual has been determined not to be newly eligible based on the December 1, 2009 standards for any eligibility category.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Components of the threshold methodology.</E> Subject to the submission of a threshold methodology State plan amendment as specified in paragraph (h) of this section, the provisions of the threshold methodology consist of two components, the individual income-based determination and population-based non-income adjustments to reflect resource criteria, enrollment caps in effect on December 1, 2009, and other factors in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The threshold methodology shall apply with respect to the population, and the associated expenditures for such population, which has been determined eligible for Medicaid under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Act and in accordance with § 435.119 of this chapter. This population and associated expenditures must not include individuals who have been determined eligible for Medicaid under any other mandatory or optional eligibility category.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Benefit criteria for newly eligible.</E> An individual eligible for and enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter is considered newly eligible if, with respect to the applicable eligibility category in effect on December 1, 2009, the benefits did not meet the criteria described in the newly eligible definition at § 433.204(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Individual income-based determination.</E> The individual income-based determination shall be a comparison of the individual's MAGI-based income to the income standard in effect on December 1, 2009, as converted to an <PRTPAGE P="115"/>equivalent MAGI-based income standard for each applicable eligibility category as in effect on that date, as follows.</P>
              <P>(i) The amount of an individual's income under the threshold methodology is the MAGI-based income determined in accordance with § 435.603 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) For each individual, the equivalent MAGI-based income eligibility standard is the applicable income eligibility standard for the applicable category of eligibility as in effect on December 1, 2009 that is converted to an equivalent MAGI-based income standard. For example, as applicable, a separate MAGI-based income standard will be applied for individuals determined to be disabled who would have been eligible under an optional eligibility category in effect on December 1, 2009 that was based on disability. For these purposes, the applicable equivalent MAGI-based standard is the standard as submitted by the State and approved by CMS in accordance with CMS guidance.</P>
              <P>(iii) With respect to income eligibility criteria, if the individual's MAGI-based income is at or below the applicable converted MAGI-based income standard for the relevant eligibility category or group, then the individual is included in the population that is not newly eligible;</P>
              <P>(iv) With respect to income eligibility criteria, if the individual's MAGI-based income is greater than the applicable converted MAGI-based income standard for the relevant eligibility category or group, then the individual is included in the population that is newly eligible;</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Treatment of spend-down programs.</E> Treatment of medically needy or spend-down programs under the threshold methodology is described in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) For purposes of comparing the individual's MAGI-based income to the applicable converted MAGI-based income standard in effect on December 1, 2009, an individual will not be considered disabled absent an actual disability determination for the individual that is in accordance with the disability definition applicable for the State under Title XIX of the Act.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Treatment of disability.</E> For purposes of applying the appropriate FMAP under § 433.10(b) or (c) for the medical assistance expenditures of an individual in applying the definition of newly eligible under § 433.204(a)(1), for eligibility categories or groups as in effect on December 1, 2009 for which disability was an eligibility criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">During the period of a disability determination.</E> During the period for which a disability determination is pending, including during the period of any appeal process, and absent an actual disability determination for the individual that is in accordance with the disability definition applicable for the State under Title XIX of the Act, the individual is not considered to be disabled.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Following a disability determination.</E> With respect to an individual for which a disability determination was pending, following the actual determination of disability, the individual will be considered disabled effective with the date of the disability determination, or, if later, the disability onset date, as determined.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Population-based adjustments to the populations of newly eligible and not newly eligible.</E> (i) The State may elect a resource criteria proxy adjustment described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) States that had a waiver or demonstration program with an enrollment cap in effect as of December 1, 2009 must apply an adjustment based on enrollment caps, subject to the definition of newly eligible individual in § 433.204(a)(1) and paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) States that have special circumstances may need to submit associated proxy methodologies to CMS for approval by CMS as described in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Application of FMAP rates to adult group expenditures.</E> Subject to population adjustments under paragraphs (d), (e), or (g) of this section, federal funding for a State's expenditures for medical assistance provided to individuals determined eligible under § 435.119 of this chapter, including individuals determined eligible under that eligibility group during the evaluation for another eligibility category, must be <PRTPAGE P="116"/>claimed using the applicable FMAP as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The newly eligible FMAP under § 433.10(c)(6) is applicable for the medical assistance expenditures for individuals determined to be newly eligible, as defined in § 433.204(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(ii) The applicable FMAP under § 433.10(b) or § 433.10(c)(7) or (8) is applicable for the medical assistance expenditures for individuals determined not to be newly eligible.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Status as newly or not newly eligible.</E> Under the threshold methodology States must provide that once individuals are determined under the threshold methodology to be either newly or not newly eligible individuals in accordance with the applicable December 1, 2009 eligibility criteria, the State would apply that determination until a new determination of MAGI-based income has been made in accordance with § 435.916 of this chapter, or the individual has been otherwise determined not to be covered under the adult group set forth at § 435.119 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional resource criteria proxy adjustment</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Under an election under this paragraph (d), the State may use a resource proxy methodology for purposes of adjusting the claims for the expenditures of the population enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter to account for individuals who would not have been eligible for Medicaid because of the application of resource criteria as in effect for such population as of December 1, 2009, and therefore would meet the newly eligible individual definition at § 433.204(a)(1). Under this paragraph (d), a State may elect to apply a resource proxy methodology with respect to the resource criteria as in effect on December 1, 2009 and applied to the expenditures for a specific eligibility category or categories of individuals as in effect on December 1, 2009, or applied to the expenditures of the entire population enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter. As provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the State must indicate any resource proxy election in the threshold methodology State plan amendment submitted under paragraph (h) of this section. The use of a resource proxy methodology must not delay or interfere with the eligibility determination for an individual.</P>
              <P>(2) A State's resource proxy methodology must:</P>
              <P>(i) Describe each eligibility group or groups for which an individual eligible under § 435.119 would have been eligible on December 1, 2009, subject to resource criteria, and a methodology to apply those resource criteria as an adjustment to the total expenditures to adjust determinations of the newly eligible population under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Be auditable.</P>
              <P>(iii) Be based on statistically valid data, which is either:</P>
              <P>(A) Existing State data from and for periods before January 1, 2014 on the resources of individuals who had applied and received a determination with respect to Medicaid eligibility, including resource eligibility under the State's applicable December 1, 2009 eligibility criteria. The existing State data must be specifically related to resource eligibility determinations, indicate the number and types of individuals for whom resource determinations were made, and establish the denial rates specifically identified as due to excess resources; or</P>

              <P>(B) Post-eligibility State data on the resources of individuals described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, based on and obtained through a post-eligibility statistically valid sample of such individuals with respect to the applicable Medicaid eligibility categories and resource eligibility criteria under the State's applicable December 1, 2009 eligibility criteria:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) State data from and for periods before January 1, 2014 must be for individuals in eligibility categories relevant to § 435.119 of this chapter who apply and receive a determination with respect to Medicaid eligibility, including both approvals and denials, to establish denial rates specifically due to excess resources and identify numbers and types of individuals.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) State data from and for periods on or after January 1, 2014 must only be for individuals determined eligible and enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter, must compare individuals' resources to the applicable December 1, 2009 resource criteria to establish denial rates <PRTPAGE P="117"/>specifically due to excess resources, and identify numbers and types of individuals.</P>
              <P>(iv) Describe the State data on individuals' resources used and the application of such data. Whether such State data is based on data described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, such State data must represent sampling results for a period of sufficient length to be statistically valid.</P>
              <P>(v) Provide that the resource proxy methodology will account for the treatment of resources in a statistically valid manner when there is a lack of sufficient information to make a resource determination for a particular individual in a sampled population.</P>
              <P>(vi) Describe the application of the resource proxy methodology in establishing the amount and submission of claims for Federal funding by the State for the medical assistance expenditures of the applicable eligibility group(s). Such claims submitted under the resource proxy methodology must reflect the appropriate FMAP for the medical assistance expenditures of the affected eligibility group(s).</P>
              <P>(vii) As appropriate, describe and demonstrate the statistical validity of the resource proxy methodology and the use of data under such methodology.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effective date for application of resource proxy.</E> The resource proxy shall not be effective prior to the beginning of the quarter in which such resource proxy is submitted to CMS under the threshold methodology State plan in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">One time election for resource proxy.</E> The election, application, and description of a resource proxy methodology under this paragraph for individuals determined eligible under § 435.119 must be included in a one-time submission of a State plan amendment submitted under paragraph (h) of this section no later than one year from the first day of the quarter in which eligibility for individuals under § 435.119 of this chapter is initially effective for the State.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Enrollment caps adjustment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Scope.</E> Certain States may have applied enrollment caps, limits, or waiting lists in their Medicaid programs as in effect on December 1, 2009. Under the definition of newly eligible individual in § 433.204(a)(1), such States must consider as newly eligible those individuals eligible under § 435.119 of this chapter who would otherwise be eligible for full benefits, benchmark coverage, or benchmark equivalent coverage provided through a demonstration under the State plan effective December 1, 2009, but would not have been enrolled (or would have been on a waiting list) based on the application of an enrollment cap or limit determined in accordance with the approved demonstration as in effect on that date. Such States must only apply such enrollment cap, limit or waiting list provisions with respect to eligibility category or categories for which such provisions were applicable (for example, nonpregnant childless adults or parents/caretaker relatives) and in effect under the State's Medicaid program on December 1, 2009. For this purpose, individuals who would have been on a waiting list are considered as not enrolled under the demonstration.</P>
              <P>(2) A State for which multiple enrollment caps or limits were in effect under its December 1, 2009 Medicaid program may elect to combine such enrollment caps or limits, unless such treatment would preclude claiming of Federal funding at the applicable FMAP rate required under § 433.10(b) or (c) (for example, to distinguish claims for childless adults and parents in an expansion State) for the medical assistance expenditures of individuals determined eligible and enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter; a State with enrollment cap or limit provisions that would preclude combining enrollment caps or limit provisions must use separate caps; or, the State, at its option, may elect to use separate caps.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of claiming Federal funding, with respect to each claiming period for which the State claims Federal funding for an eligibility category for which an enrollment cap or limit is applicable and in effect on December 1, 2009, the State must account for:</P>

              <P>(i) The total unduplicated number of individuals eligible and enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter for the applicable claiming period.<PRTPAGE P="118"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The total State medical assistance expenditures for individuals eligible and enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter for the applicable claiming period.</P>
              <P>(iii) The enrollment cap or limit in effect on December 1, 2009 for the eligibility category, determined in accordance with the approved demonstration as in effect on December 1, 2009.</P>
              <P>(A) For States that elect under paragraph (e)(2) of this section to combine the enrollment caps, the enrollment cap is the sum of the enrollment caps for each eligibility group which is being combined.</P>
              <P>(B) For States that elect to treat the enrollment caps separately under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each enrollment cap will be accounted for separately.</P>
              <P>(C) The level of the enrollment cap will be as authorized under the demonstration in effect on December 1, 2009; or, if the State had affirmatively set the cap at a lower level consistent with flexibility provided by the demonstration terms and conditions, the State may elect to apply the lower cap as in effect in the State on December 1, 2009. If a State elects to use such an alternate State-specified enrollment cap, the State will provide CMS with evidence, in its State plan amendment submitted to CMS under paragraph (h) of this section, that it had affirmatively implemented such a cap. Whether the State uses the authorized cap or a lower, verifiable cap as in effect in the State consistent with the demonstration special terms and conditions, the amount of expenditures up to the proportion of the 2009 enrollment cap to the total number of currently enrolled people in the group would not be claimed at the newly eligible FMAP.</P>
              <P>(4) States for which an enrollment cap, limit, or waiting list was applicable under their Medicaid programs as in effect on December 1, 2009, must describe the treatment of such provision or provisions in the submission to CMS for approval by CMS in accordance with the State plan requirements outlined in § 433.206(h).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Application of spend-down income eligibility criteria</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Certain States' Medicaid programs as in effect on December 1, 2009 may have included eligibility categories for which deduction of incurred medical expenses from income (referred to as spend-down) under the provisions of sections 1902(a)(10)(C) or 1902(f) of the Act was applied in determining individuals' Medicaid eligibility. Paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section apply, for purposes of determining whether an individual enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter meets the definition of newly eligible under § 433.204(a)(1), and for purposes of applying the appropriate FMAP under § 433.10(b) or (c) for the medical assistance expenditures of the individual for which a spend-down eligibility category of a State effective on December 1, 2009 is applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Not newly eligible individual.</E> For purposes of a State's spend-down provision, an individual enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter whose income before the deduction of incurred medical expenses is less than or equal to the applicable December 1, 2009 State spend-down eligibility income level that would have resulted in full benefits is considered not newly eligible. The FMAP applicable for the medical assistance expenditures of such an individual is the appropriate FMAP under § 433.10(b) and (c) as applicable for an individual who is not newly eligible.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Newly eligible individual.</E> For purposes of a State's spend-down provision, an individual enrolled under § 435.119 of this chapter whose income before the deduction of incurred medical expenses is greater than the applicable State spend-down eligibility income level is considered newly eligible. The FMAP applicable for the medical assistance expenditures of such an individual is the appropriate FMAP under § 433.10(b) and (c) as applicable for an individual who is newly eligible.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Special circumstances.</E> States may submit additional proxy methodologies to CMS for approval by CMS in accordance with the State plan requirements outlined in § 433.206(h).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Threshold methodology State plan requirements.</E> To claim expenditures at the increased FMAPs described in § 433.210(c)(6) or (c)(8), the State must amend its State plan under the provisions of subpart B of part 430 to reflect the threshold methodology the State implements in accordance with the <PRTPAGE P="119"/>provisions of this section. The threshold methodology will be included as an attachment to the State plan and, explicitly and by reference, must:</P>
              <P>(1) Specify that the threshold methodology the State implements is in accordance with this section;</P>
              <P>(2) Specify that the threshold methodology the State implements accounts for the individuals determined eligible under the adult group in § 435.119 of this chapter as a newly eligible individual or not newly eligible individual; and, on that basis, the State implements appropriate tracking for purpose of claiming Federal Medicaid funding for the associated medical assistance expenditures.</P>
              <P>(3) Reference the converted MAGI-based December 1, 2009 income eligibility standards and the associated eligibility groups, describe how the State will apply such standards and methodologies, and include other relevant criteria in the assignment of FMAP.</P>
              <P>(4) Indicate any required provisions, or options and alternatives the State elects, with respect to:</P>
              <P>(i) Treatment of resources, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Treatment of enrollment caps or waiting lists, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Special circumstances as approved by CMS in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Overpayments made to providers that are discovered by the State;</P>
              <P>(2) Overpayments made to providers that are initially discovered by the provider and made known to the State agency; and</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rules.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the State Medicaid agency has 1 year from the date of discovery of an overpayment to a provider to recover or seek to recover the overpayment before the Federal share must be refunded to CMS.</P>
              <P>(2) The State Medicaid agency must refund the Federal share of overpayments at the end of the 1-year period following discovery in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, whether or not the State has recovered the overpayment from the provider.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception.</E> The agency is not required to refund the Federal share of an overpayment made to a provider when the State is unable to recover the <PRTPAGE P="121"/>overpayment amount because the provider has been determined bankrupt or out of business in accordance with § 433.318.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) The requirements of this subpart apply to overpayments made to Medicaid providers that occur and are discovered in any quarter that begins on or after October 1, 1985.</P>
              <P>(2) The date upon which an overpayment occurs is the date upon which a State, using its normal method of reimbursement for a particular class of provider (e.g., check, interfund transfer), makes the payment involving unallowable costs to a provider.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When discovery of overpayment occurs and its significance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The date on which an overpayment is discovered is the beginning date of the 1-year period allowed for a State to recover or seek to recover an overpayment before a refund of the Federal share of an overpayment must be made to CMS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements for notification.</E> Unless a State official or fiscal agent of the State chooses to initiate a formal recoupment action against a provider without first giving written notification of its intent, a State Medicaid agency official or other State official must notify the provider in writing of any overpayment it discovers in accordance with State agency policies and procedures and must take reasonable actions to attempt to recover the overpayment in accordance with State law and procedures.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Overpayments resulting from situations other than fraud.</E> An overpayment resulting from a situation other than fraud is discovered on the earliest of—-</P>
              <P>(1) The date on which any Medicaid agency official or other State official first notifies a provider in writing of an overpayment and specifies a dollar amount that is subject to recovery;</P>
              <P>(2) The date on which a provider initially acknowledges a specific overpaid amount in writing to the medicaid agency; or</P>
              <P>(3) The date on which any State official or fiscal agent of the State initiates a formal action to recoup a specific overpaid amount from a provider without having first notified the provider in writing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Overpayments resulting from fraud.</E> (1) An overpayment that results from fraud is discovered on the date of the final written notice (as defined in § 433.304 of this subchapter) of the State's overpayment determination.</P>
              <P>(2) When the State is unable to recover a debt which represents an overpayment (or any portion thereof) resulting from fraud within 1 year of discovery because no final determination of the amount of the overpayment has been made under an administrative or judicial process (as applicable), including as a result of a judgment being under appeal, no adjustment shall be made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment (or any portion thereof) until 30 days after the date on which a final judgment (including, if applicable, a final determination on an appeal) is made.</P>
              <P>(3) The Medicaid agency may treat an overpayment made to a Medicaid provider as resulting from fraud under subsection (d) of this section only if it has referred a provider's case to the Medicaid fraud control unit, or appropriate law enforcement agency in States with no certified Medicaid fraud control unit, as required by § 455.15, § 455.21, or § 455.23 of this chapter, and the Medicaid fraud control unit or appropriate law enforcement agency has provided the Medicaid agency with written notification of acceptance of the case; or if the Medicaid fraud control unit or appropriate law enforcement agency has filed a civil or criminal action against a provider and has notified the State Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Overpayments identified through Federal reviews.</E> If a Federal review at any time indicates that a State has failed to identify an overpayment or a State has identified an overpayment but has failed to either send written notice of the overpayment to the provider that specified a dollar amount subject to recovery or initiate a formal recoupment from the provider without having first notified the provider in writing, CMS will consider the overpayment as discovered on the date that the Federal official first notifies the State in writing of the overpayment <PRTPAGE P="122"/>and specifies a dollar amount subject to recovery.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Effect of changes in overpayment amount.</E> Any adjustment in the amount of an overpayment during the 1-year period following discovery (made in accordance with the approved State plan, Federal law and regulations governing Medicaid, and the appeals resolution process specified in State administrative policies and procedures) has the following effect on the 1-year recovery period:</P>
              <P>(1) A downward adjustment in the amount of an overpayment subject to recovery that occurs after discovery does not change the original 1-year recovery period for the outstanding balance.</P>
              <P>(2) An upward adjustment in the amount of an overpayment subject to recovery that occurs during the 1-year period following discovery does not change the 1-year recovery period for the original overpayment amount. A new 1-year period begins for the incremental amount only, beginning with the date of the State's written notification to the provider regarding the upward adjustment.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Effect of partial collection by State.</E> A partial collection of an overpayment amount by the State from a provider during the 1-year period following discovery does not change the 1-year recovery period for the balance of the original overpayment amount due to CMS.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Effect of administrative or judicial appeals.</E> Any appeal rights extended to a provider do not extend the date of discovery.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Overpayments involving providers who are bankrupt or out of business.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rules.</E> (1) The agency is not required to refund the Federal share of an overpayment made to a provider as required by § 433.312(a) to the extent that the State is unable to recover the overpayment because the provider has been determined bankrupt or out of business in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The agency must notify the provider that an overpayment exists in any case involving a bankrupt or out-of-business provider and, if the debt has not been determined uncollectable, take reasonable actions to recover the overpayment during the 1-year recovery period in accordance with policies prescribed by applicable State law and administrative procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overpayment debts that the State need not refund.</E> Overpayments are considered debts that the State is unable to recover within the 1-year period following discovery if the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The provider has filed for bankruptcy, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(2) The provider has gone out of business and the State is unable to locate the provider and its assets, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Bankruptcy.</E> The agency is not required to refund to CMS the Federal share of an overpayment at the end of the 1-year period following discovery, if—</P>
              <P>(1) The provider has filed for bankruptcy in Federal court at the time of discovery of the overpayment or the provider files a bankruptcy petition in Federal court before the end of the 1-year period following discovery; and</P>
              <P>(2) The State is on record with the court as a creditor of the petitioner in the amount of the Medicaid overpayment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Out of business.</E> (1) The agency is not required to refund to CMS the Federal share of an overpayment at the end of the 1-year period following discovery if the provider is out of business on the date of discovery of the overpayment or if the provider goes out of business before the end of the 1-year period following discovery.</P>
              <P>(2) A provider is considered to be out of business on the effective date of a determination to that effect under State law. The agency must—</P>
              <P>(i) Document its efforts to locate the party and its assets. These efforts must be consistent with applicable State policies and procedures; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Make available an affidavit or certification from the appropriate State legal authority establishing that the provider is out of business and that the overpayment cannot be collected under State law and procedures and <PRTPAGE P="123"/>citing the effective date of that determination under State law.</P>
              <P>(3) A provider is not out of business when ownershp is transferred within the State unless State law and procedures deem a provider that has transferred ownership to be out of business and preclude collection of the overpayment from the provider.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Circumstances requiring refunds.</E> If the 1-year recovery period has expired before an overpayment is found to be uncollectable under the provisions of this section, if the State recovers an overpayment amount under a court-approved discharge of bankruptcy, or if a bankruptcy petition is denied, the agency must refund the Federal share of the overpayment in accordance with the procedures specified in § 433.320 of this subpart.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 433.320</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for refunds to CMS.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic requirements.</E> (1) The agency must refund the Federal share of overpayments that are subject to recovery to CMS through a credit on its Quarterly Statement of Expenditures (Form CMS-64).</P>
              <P>(2) The agency must credit CMS with the Federal share of overpayments subject to recovery on the earlier of—</P>
              <P>(i) The Form CMS-64 submission due to CMS for the quarter in which the State recovers the overpayment from the provider; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The Form CMS-64 due to CMS for the quarter in which the 1-year period following discovery, established in accordance with § 433.316, ends.</P>
              <P>(3) A credit on the Form CMS-64 must be made whether or not the overpayment has been recovered by the State from the provider.</P>
              <P>(4) If the State does not refund the Federal share of such overpayment as indicated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the State will be liable for interest on the amount equal to the Federal share of the non-recovered, non-refunded overpayment amount. Interest during this period will be at the Current Value of Funds Rate (CVFR), and will accrue beginning on the day after the end of the 1-year period following discovery until the last day of the quarter for which the State submits a CMS-64 report refunding the Federal share of the overpayment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of reporting collections and submitting reduced expenditure claims.</E> (1) The State is not required to refund the Federal share of an overpayment at the end of the 1-year period if the State has already reported a collection or submitted an expenditure claim reduced by a discrete amount to recover the overpayment prior to the end of the 1-year period following discovery.</P>
              <P>(2) The State is not required to report on the Form CMS-64 any collections made on overpayment amounts for which the Federal share has been refunded previously.</P>
              <P>(3) If a State has refunded the Federal share of an overpayment as required under this subpart and the State subsequently makes recovery by reducing future provider payments by a discrete amount, the State need not reflect that reduction in its claim for Federal financial participation.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reclaiming overpayment amounts previously refunded to CMS.</E> If the amount of an overpayment is adjusted downward after the agency has credited CMS with the Federal share, the agency may reclaim the amount of the downward adjustment on the Form CMS-64. Under this provision—</P>
              <P>(1) Downward adjustment to an overpayment amount previously credited to CMS is allowed only if it is properly based on the approved State plan, Federal law and regulations governing Medicaid, and the appeals resolution processes specified in State administrative policies and procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) The 2-year filing limit for retroactive claims for Medicaid expenditures does not apply. A downward adjustment is not considered a retroactive claim but rather a reclaiming of costs previously claimed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Expiration of 1-year recovery period.</E> If an overpayment has not been determined uncollectable in accordance with the requirements of § 433.318 of this subpart at the end of the 1-year period following discovery of the overpayment, the agency must refund the Federal share of the overpayment to CMS in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="124"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Court-approved discharge of bankruptcy.</E> If the State recovers any portion of an overpayment under a court-approved discharge of bankruptcy, the agency must refund to CMS the Federal share of the overpayment amount collected on the next quarterly expenditure report that is due to CMS for the period that includes the date on which the collection occurs.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Bankruptcy petition denied.</E> If a provider's petition for bankruptcy is denied in Federal court, the agency must credit CMS with the Federal share of the overpayment on the later of—</P>
              <P>(1) The Form CMS-64 submission due to CMS immediately following the date of the decision of the court; or</P>
              <P>(2) The Form CMS-64 submission for the quarter in which the 1-year period following discovery of the overpayment ends.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reclaim of refunds.</E> (1) If a provider is determined bankrupt or out of business under this section after the 1-year period following discovery of the overpayment ends and the State has not been able to make complete recovery, the agency may reclaim the amount of the Federal share of any unrecovered overpayment amount previously refunded to CMS. CMS allows the reclaim of a refund by the agency if the agency submits to CMS documentation that it has made reasonable efforts to obtain recovery.</P>
              <P>(2) If the agency reclaims a refund of the Federal share of an overpayment—</P>
              <P>(i) In bankruptcy cases, the agency must submit to CMS a statement of its efforts to recover the overpayment during the period before the petition for bankruptcy was filed; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In out-of-business cases, the agency must submit to CMS a statement of its efforts to locate the provider and its assets and to recover the overpayment during any period before the provider is found to be out of business in accordance with § 433.318.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Supporting reports.</E> The agency must report the following information to support each Quarterly Statement of Expenditures Form CMS-64:</P>
              <P>(1) Amounts of overpayments not collected during the quarter but refunded because of the expiration of the 1-year period following discovery;</P>
              <P>(2) Upward and downward adjustments to amounts credited in previous quarters;</P>
              <P>(3) Amounts of overpayments collected under court-approved discharges of bankruptcy;</P>
              <P>(4) Amounts of previously reported overpayments to providers certified as bankrupt or out of business during the quarter; and</P>
              <P>(5) Amounts of overpayments previously credited and reclaimed by the State.</P>

                <P>Except as allowed under § 435.121, the agency must provide Medicaid to aged, blind, and disabled individuals or couples who are receiving or are deemed to be receiving SSI. This includes individuals who are—</P>

(Regulations at 20 CFR 416.260 through 416.269 contain requirements governing determinations of eligibility under this provision.)

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic eligibility group requirements.</E> (1) If the agency does not provide Medicaid under § 435.120 to aged, blind, and disabled individuals who are SSI beneficiaries, the agency must provide Medicaid to aged, blind, and disabled individuals who meet eligibility requirements that are specified in this section.</P>

                <P>(2) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the agency may elect to apply more restrictive eligibility requirements to the aged, blind, and disabled that are more restrictive than those of the SSI program. The more restrictive requirements may be no more restrictive than those requirements contained in the State's Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972. If any of the State's 1972 Medicaid plan requirements were more liberal than of the SSI program, the State must use the SSI requirement instead of the more liberal requirements, except to the extent the State elects to use more liberal criteria under § 435.601.<PRTPAGE P="140"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) The agency must not apply a more restrictive requirement under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if:</P>
                <P>(i) The requirement conflicts with the requirements of section 1924 of the Act, which governs the eligibility and post-eligibility treatment of income and resources of institutionalized individuals with community spouses;</P>
                <P>(ii) The requirement conflicts with a more liberal requirement which the agency has elected to use under § 435.601; or</P>
                <P>(iii) The more restrictive requirement conflicts with a more liberal requirement the State has elected to use under § 435.234(c) in determining eligibility for State supplementary payments.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Mandatory coverage.</E> If the agency chooses to apply more restrictive requirements than SSI to aged, blind, or disabled individuals, it must provide Medicaid to:</P>
                <P>(1) Individuals who meet the requirements of section 1619(b)(3) of the Act even though they may not continue to meet the requirements of this section; and</P>
                <P>(2) Qualified Medicare beneficiaries described in section 1905(p) of the Act and qualified working disabled individuals described in section 1905(s) of the Act without consideration of the more restrictive eligibility requirements specified in this section.</P>
                <P>(3) Individuals who:</P>
                <P>(i) Qualify for benefits under section 1619(a) or are in eligibility status under section 1619(b)(1) of the Act as determined by SSA; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Were eligible for Medicaid under the more restrictive criteria in the State's approved Medicaid plan in the reference month—the month immediately preceding the first month in which they became eligible under section 1619(a) or (b)(1) of the Act. “Were eligible for Medicaid” means that individuals were issued Medicaid cards by the State for the reference month. Under this provision, the reference month for determining Medicaid eligibility for all individuals under section 1619 of the Act is the month immediately preceding the first month of the most recent period of eligibility under section 1619 of the Act.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Group composition.</E> The agency may apply more restrictive requirements only to the aged, to the blind, to the disabled, or to any combination of these groups. For example, the agency may apply more restrictive requirements to the aged and disabled under this provision and provide Medicaid to all blind individuals who are SSI beneficiaries.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Nonfinancial conditions.</E> The agency may apply more restrictive requirements that are nonfinancial conditions of eligibility. For example, the agency may use a more restrictive definition of disability or may limit eligibility of the disabled to individuals age 18 and older, or both. If the agency limits eligibility of disabled individuals to individuals age 18 or older, it must provide Medicaid to individuals under age 18 who receive SSI benefits and who would be eligible to receive AFDC under the State's approved plan if they did not receive SSI. If the agency imposed an age limit for disabled individuals under its 1972 approved State plan but does not use that limit, it must apply the same nonfinancial requirement to individuals under age 18 that it applies to disabled individuals age 18 and older.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Financial conditions.</E> (1) The agency may apply more restrictive requirements that are financial conditions of eligibility.</P>
                <P>(2) Any income eligibility standards that the agency applies must:</P>
                <P>(i) Equal the income standard (or Federal Benefit Rate (FBR)) that would be used under SSI based on an individual's living arrangement; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Be a more restrictive standard which is no more restrictive than that under the approved State's January 1, 1972 Medicaid plan.</P>
                <P>(3) If the categorically needy income standard established under paragraph (e)(2) of this section is less than the optional categorically needy standard established under § 435.230, the agency must provide Medicaid to all aged, blind, and disabled individuals who have income equal to or below the higher standard.</P>

                <P>(4) In a State that does not have a medically needy program that covers aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the agency must allow individuals to <PRTPAGE P="141"/>deduct from income incurred medical and remedial expenses (that is, spend down) to become eligible under this section. However, individuals with income above the categorically needy standards may only spend down to the standard selected by the State under paragraph (e)(2) of this section which applies to the individual's living arrangement.</P>
                <P>(5) In a State that elects to provide medically needy coverage to aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the agency must allow individuals to deduct from income incurred medical and remedial care expenses (spend down) to become categorically needy when they are SSI beneficiaries (including individuals deemed to be SSI beneficiaries under §§ 435.135, 435.137, and 435.138), eligible spouses of SSI beneficiaries, State supplement beneficiaries, and individuals who are eligible for a supplement but who do not receive supplementary payments. Such persons may only spend down to the standard selected by the State under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Individuals who are not SSI beneficiaries, eligible spouses of SSI beneficiaries, State supplement beneficiaries, or individuals who are eligible for a supplement must spend down to the State's medically needy income standards for aged, blind, and disabled individuals in order to become Medicaid eligible.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Deductions from income.</E> (1) In addition to any income disregards specified in the approved State plan in accordance with § 435.601(b), the agency must deduct from income:</P>
                <P>(i) SSI payments;</P>
                <P>(ii) State supplementary payments that meet the conditions specified in §§ 435.232 and 435.234; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Expenses incurred by the individual or financially responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that are recognized under State law and are not subject to payment by a third party, unless the third party is a public program of a State or political subdivision of a State. These expenses include Medicare and other health insurance premiums, deductions and coinsurance charges, and copayments or deductibles imposed under § 447.52, § 447.53, or § 447.54 of this chapter. The agency may set reasonable limits on the amounts of incurred medical expenses that are deducted.</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of counting income with respect to individuals who are receiving benefits under section 1619(a) f the Act or are in section 1619(b)(1) of the Act status but who do not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the agency may disregard some or all of the amount of the individual's income that is in excess of the SSI Federal benefit rate under section 1611(b) of the Act.</P>

A determination of eligibility for SSI payments based on disability that is made by SSA automatically confers Medicaid eligibility, as provided for under § 435.909.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of SSA determinations.</E> (1) Except in the circumstances specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section—</P>
                <P>(i) An SSA disability determination is binding on an agency until the determination is changed by SSA.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the SSA determination is changed, the new determination is also binding on the agency.</P>
                <P>(2) The agency must refer to SSA all applicants who allege new information or evidence affecting previous SSA determinations of ineligibility based upon disability for reconsideration or reopening of the determination, except in cases specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Determinations made by the Medicaid agency.</E> The agency must make a determination of disability in accordance with the requirements of this section if any of the following circumstances exist:</P>
                <P>(1) The individual applies for Medicaid as a non-cash beneficiary and has not applied to SSA for SSI cash benefits, whether or not a State has a section 1634 agreement with SSA; or an individual applies for Medicaid and has applied to SSA for SSI benefits and is found ineligible for SSI for a reason other than disability.</P>
                <P>(2) The individual applies both to SSA for SSI and to the State Medicaid agency for Medicaid, the State agency has a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and SSA has not made an SSI disability determination within 90 days from the date of the individual's application for Medicaid.</P>
                <P>(3) The individual applies to SSA for SSI and to the State Medicaid agency for Medicaid, the State does not have a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and either the State uses more restrictive criteria than SSI for determining Medicaid eligibility under its section 1902(f) option or, in the case of a State that uses SSI criteria, SSA has not made an SSI disability determination in time for the State to comply with the Medicaid time limit for making a prompt determination on an individual's application for Medicaid.</P>
                <P>(4) The individual applies for Medicaid as a non-cash beneficiary, whether or not the State has a section 1634 agreement with SSA, and—</P>
                <P>(i) Alleges a disabling condition different from, or in addition to, that considered by SSA in making its determination; or</P>

                <P>(ii) Alleges more than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her <PRTPAGE P="164"/>condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination and alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Act, and has not applied to SSA for a determination with respect to these allegations.</P>
                <P>(iii) Alleges less than 12 months after the most recent SSA determination denying disability that his or her condition has changed or deteriorated since that SSA determination, alleges a new period of disability which meets the durational requirements of the Act, and—</P>
                <P>(A) Has applied to SSA for reconsideration or reopening of its disability decision and SSA refused to consider the new allegations; and/or</P>
                <P>(B) He or she no longer meets the nondisability requirements for SSI but may meet the State's nondisability requirements for Medicaid eligibility.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Basis for determinations.</E> The agency must make a determination of disability as provided in paragraph (c) of this section—</P>
                <P>(1) On the basis of the evidence required under paragraph (e) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(2) In accordance with the requirements for evaluating that evidence under the SSI program specified in 20 CFR 416.901 through 416.998.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Medical and nonmedical evidence.</E> The agency must obtain a medical report and other nonmedical evidence for individuals applying for Medicaid on the basis of disability. The medical report and nonmedical evidence must include diagnosis and other information in accordance with the requirements for evidence applicable to disability determinations under the SSI program specified in 20 CFR part 416, subpart I.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Disability review teams</E>—(1) <E T="03">Function.</E> A review team must review the medical report and other evidence required under paragraph (e) of this section and determine on behalf of the agency whether the individual's condition meets the definition of disability.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Composition.</E> The review team must be composed of a medical or psychological consultant and another individual who is qualified to interpret and evaluate medical reports and other evidence relating to the individual's physical or mental impairments and, as necessary, to determine the capacities of the individual to perform substantial gainful activity, as specified in 20 CFR part 416, subpart J.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Periodic reexaminations.</E> The review team must determine whether and when reexaminations will be necessary for periodic redeterminations of eligibility as required under § 435.916 of this part, using the principles set forth in 20 CFR 416.989 and 416.990. If a State uses the same definition of disability as SSA, as provided for under § 435.540, and a beneficiary is Medicaid eligible because he or she receives SSI, this paragraph (f)(3) does not apply. The reexamination will be conducted by SSA.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic rule for use of non-MAGI financial methodologies.</E> (1) This section only applies to individuals excepted from application of MAGI-based methods in accordance with § 435.603(j).</P>

              <P>(2) Except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section or in § 435.121 or as permitted under § 435.831(b)(1), in <PRTPAGE P="165"/>determining financial eligibility of individuals as categorically or medically needy, the agency must apply the financial methodologies and requirements of the cash assistance program that is most closely categorically related to the individual's status.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Financial responsibility of relatives.</E> The agency must use the requirements for financial responsibility of relatives specified in § 435.602.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of less restrictive methodologies than those under cash assistance programs.</E> (1) At State option, and subject to the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2) through (5) of this section, the agency may apply income and resource methodologies that are less restrictive than the cash assistance methodologies or methodologies permitted under § 435.831(b)(1) in determining eligibility for the following groups:</P>
              <P>(i) Qualified Medicare beneficiaries specified in sections 1902(a)(10)(E) and 1905(p) of the Act;</P>
              <P>(ii) Optional categorically needy individuals under groups established under subpart C of this part and section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii) of the Act;</P>

              <P>(2) The income and resource methodologies that an agency elects to apply to groups of individuals described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be less restrictive, but no more restrictive (except in States using more restrictive requirements than SSI), than:</P>
              <P>(i) For groups of aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the SSI methodologies; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For all other groups, the methodologies under the State plan most closely categorically related to the individual's status.</P>
              <P>(3) A financial methodology is considered to be no more restrictive if, by using the methodology, additional individuals may be eligible for Medicaid and no individuals who are otherwise eligible are by use of that methodology made ineligible for Medicaid.</P>
              <P>(4) The less restrictive methodology applied under this section must be comparable for all persons within each category of assistance (aged, or blind, or disabled, or AFDC related) within an eligibility group. For example, if the agency chooses to apply less restrictive income or resource methodology to an eligibility group of aged individuals, it must apply that methodology to all aged individuals within the selected group.</P>

              <P>(2) If the agency chooses to apply less restrictive income and resource methodologies, the State plan must specify:</P>

              <P>(ii) In relation to individuals under age 21 (as described in section 1905(a)(i) of the Act), the financial responsibility requirements and methodologies that apply include considering the income and resources of parents or spouses whose income and resources will be considered if the individual under age 21 were dependent under the State's approved State plan under title IV-A of the Act in effect as of July 16, 1996, whether or not they are actually contributed, except as specified under paragraph (c) of this section. These requirements and methodologies must be applied in accordance with the provisions of the State's approved title IV-A State plan as of July 16, 1996.</P>
              <P>(iii) When a couple ceases to live together, the agency must count only the income of the individual spouse in determining his or her eligibility, beginning the first month following the month the couple ceases to live together.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the case of eligible institutionalized spouses who are aged, blind, and disabled and who have shared the same room in a title XIX Medicaid institution, the agency has the option of considering these couples as eligible couples for purposes of counting income and resources or as eligible individuals, whichever is more advantageous to the couple.</P>

              <P>(2) More extensive requirements for relative responsibility than specified in § 435.602(a) but no more extensive than the requirements under the Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of less restrictive methodologies.</E> The agency may apply income and resources methodologies that are less restrictive than those used under the cash assistance programs as specified in the State Medicaid plan in accordance with § 435.601(d).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Medically needy income standard: General requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, to determine eligibility of medically needy individuals, a Medicaid agency must use a single income standard under this subpart that meets the requirements of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) The income standard must take into account the number of persons in the assistance unit. Subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The standard may not diminish by an increase in the number of persons in the assistance unit. For example, if the income level in the standard for an assistance unit of two is set at $400, the income level in the standard for an assistance unit of three may not be less than $400.</P>
                <P>(c) In States that do not use more restrictive requirements than SSI, the income standard must be set at an amount that is no lower than the lowest income standards used under the cash assistance programs that are related to the State's covered medically needy eligibility group or groups of individuals under § 435.301. The amount of the income standard is subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) In States that use more restrictive requirements for aged, blind, and disabled individuals than SSI:</P>
                <P>(1) For all individuals except aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the income standard must be set in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(2) For all aged, blind, and disabled individuals or any combination of these groups of individuals, the agency may establish a separate single medically needy income standard that is more restrictive than the single income standard set under paragraph (c) of this section. However, the amount of the more restrictive separate standard for aged, blind, or disabled individuals must be no lower than the higher of the lowest categorically needy income standard currently applied under the State's more restrictive criteria under § 435.121 or the medically needy income standard in effect under the State's Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972. The amount of the income standard is subject to the limitations specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) The income standards specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section must not exceed the maximum dollar amount of income allowed for purposes of FFP under § 435.1007.</P>
                <P>(f) The income standard may vary based on the variations between shelter costs in urban areas and rural areas.</P>

                <P>The agency must determine income eligibility of medically needy individuals in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Budget periods.</E> (1) The agency must use budget periods of not more than 6 months to compute income. The agency may use more than one budget period.</P>
                <P>(2) The agency may include in the budget period in which income is computed all or part of the 3-month retroactive period specified in § 435.915. The budget period can begin no earlier than the first month in the retroactive period in which the individual received covered services. This provision applies to all medically needy individuals except in groups for whom criteria more restrictive than that used in the SSI program apply.</P>
                <P>(3) If the agency elects to begin the first budget period for the medically needy in any month of the 3-month period prior to the date of the application in which the applicant received covered services, this election applies to all medically needy groups.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining countable income.</E> For purposes of determining medically needy eligibility under this part, the agency must determine an individual's countable income as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) For individuals under age 21, pregnant women, and parents and other caretaker relatives, the agency may apply—</P>
                <P>(i) The AFDC methodologies in effect in the State as of August 16, 1996, consistent with § 435.601 (relating to financial methodologies for non-MAGI eligibility determinations) and § 435.602 (relating to financial responsibility of relatives and other individuals for non-MAGI eligibility determinations); or</P>
                <P>(ii) The MAGI-based methodologies defined in § 435.603(b) through (f). If the agency applies the MAGI-based methodologies defined in § 435.603(b) through (f), the agency must comply with the terms of § 435.602, except that in applying § 435.602(a)(2)(ii) to individuals under age 21, the agency may, at State option, include all parents as defined in § 435.603(b) (including stepparents) who are living with the individual in the individual's household for purposes of determining household income and family size, without regard to whether the parent's income and resources would be counted under the State's approved State plan under title IV-A of the Act in effect as of July 16, 1996, if the individual were a dependent child under such State plan.</P>
                <P>(2) For aged, blind, or disabled individuals in States covering all SSI beneficiaries, the agency must deduct amounts that would be deducted in determining eligibility under SSI. However, the agency must also deduct the highest amounts from income that would be deducted in determining eligibility for optional State supplements if these supplements are paid to all individuals who are receiving SSI or would be eligible for SSI except for their income.</P>
                <P>(3) For aged, blind, or disabled individuals in States using income requirements more restrictive than SSI, the agency must deduct amounts that are no more restrictive than those used under the Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972 and no more liberal than those used in determining eligibility under SSI or an optional State supplement. However, the amounts must be at least the same as those that would be deducted in determining eligibility, under § 435.121, of the categorically needy.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility based on countable income.</E> If countable income determined under paragraph (b) of this section is equal to or less than that applicable income standard under § 435.814, the individual is eligible for Medicaid.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Deduction of incurred medical expenses.</E> If countable income exceeds the income standard, the agency must deduct from income medical expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially responsible relatives that are not subject to payment by a third party. An expense is incurred on the date liability for the expense arises. The agency must determine deductible incurred expenses in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="178"/>paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section and deduct those expenses in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required deductions based on kinds of services.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g), in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income, the agency must include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Expenses for Medicare and other health insurance premiums, and deductibles or coinsurance charges, including enrollment fees, copayments, or deductibles imposed under § 447.51 or § 447.53 of this subchapter;</P>
                <P>(2) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that are recognized under State law but not included in the plan;</P>
                <P>(3) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or by financially responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that are included in the plan, including those that exceed agency limitations on amount, duration, or scope of services.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required deductions based on the age of bills.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g), in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income, the agency must include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) For the first budget period or periods that include only months before the month of application for medical assistance, expenses incurred during such period or periods, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility;</P>
                <P>(2) For the first prospective budget period that also includes any of the 3 months before the month of application for medical assistance, expenses incurred during such budget period, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility;</P>
                <P>(3) For the first prospective budget period that includes none of the months preceding the month of application, expenses incurred during such budget period and any of the 3 preceding months, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility;</P>
                <P>(4) For any of the 3 months preceding the month of application that are not includable under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, expenses incurred in the 3-month period that were a current liability of the individual in any such month for which a spenddown calculation is made and that had not been previously deducted from income in establishing eligibility for medical assistance;</P>
                <P>(5) Current payments (that is, payments made in the current budget period) on other expenses incurred before the current budget period and not previously deducted from income in any budget period in establishing eligibility for such period; and</P>
                <P>(6) If the individual's eligibility for medical assistance was established in each such preceding period, expenses incurred before the current budget period but not previously deducted from income in establishing eligibility, to the extent that such expenses are unpaid and are:</P>
                <P>(i) Described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Carried over from the preceding budget period or periods because the individual had a spenddown liability in each such preceding period that was met without deducting all such incurred, unpaid expenses.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Determination of deductible incurred medical expenses: Optional deductions.</E> In determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income, the agency—</P>
                <P>(1) May include medical institutional expenses (other than expenses in acute care facilities) projected to the end of the budget period at the Medicaid reimbursement rate;</P>

                <P>(2) May, to the extent determined by the State and specified in its approved plan, include expenses incurred earlier than the third month before the month of application (except States using more restrictive eligibility criteria under the option in section 1902(f) of the Act must deduct incurred expenses regardless of when the expenses were incurred); and<PRTPAGE P="179"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) May set reasonable limits on the amount to be deducted for expenses specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (g)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Order of deduction.</E> The agency must deduct incurred medical expenses that are deductible under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section in the order prescribed under one of the following three options:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Type of service.</E> Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in the following order based on type of expense or service:</P>
                <P>(i) Cost-sharing expenses as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) Services not included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section but that exceed limitations on amounts, duration, or scope of services.</P>
                <P>(iv) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section but that are within agency limitations on amount, duration, or scope of services.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Chronological order by service date.</E> Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each service is furnished, or in the case of insurance premiums, coinsurance or deductible charges, the date such amounts are due. Expenses for services furnished on the same day may be deducted in any reasonable order established by the State.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Chronological order by bill submission date.</E> Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each bill is submitted to the agency by the individual. If more than one bill is submitted at one time, the agency must deduct the bills from income in the order prescribed in either paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Eligibility based on incurred medical expenses.</E> (1) Whether a State elects partial or full month coverage, an individual who is expected to contribute a portion of his or her income toward the costs of institutional care or home and community-based services under § 435.725, § 435.726, § 435.733, § 435.735 or § 435.832 is eligible on the first day of the applicable budget (spenddown) period—</P>
                <P>(i) If his or her spenddown liability is met after the first day of the budget period; and</P>
                <P>(ii) If beginning eligibility after the first day of the budget period makes the individual's share of health care expenses under § 435.725, § 435.726, § 435.733, § 435.735 or § 435.832 greater than the individual's contributable income determined under these sections.</P>

                <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, in States that elect partial month coverage, an individual is eligible for Medicaid on the day that the deduction of incurred health care expenses (and of projected institutional expenses if the agency elects the option under paragraph (g)(1) of this section) reduces income to the income standard.</P>
                <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, in States that elect full month coverage, an individual is eligible on the first day of the month in which spenddown liability is met.</P>
                <P>(5) Expenses used to meet spenddown liability are not reimbursable under Medicaid. To the extent necessary to prevent the transfer of an individual's spenddown liability to the Medicaid program, States must reduce the amount of provider charges that would otherwise be reimbursable under Medicaid.</P>

                <P>(1) For all individuals except aged, blind, and disabled individuals, the resource standard must be set in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(2) For all aged, blind, and disabled individuals or any combination of these groups of individuals, the agency may establish a separate single medically needy resource standard that is more restrictive than the single resource standard set under paragraph (b) of this section. However, the amount of the more restrictive separate standard for aged, blind, or disabled individuals must be no lower than the higher of the lowest categorically needy resource standard currently applied under the State's more restrictive criteria under § 435.121 or the medically needy resource standard in effect under the State's Medicaid plan on January 1, 1972.</P>
                <P>(d) The resource standard established under paragraph (a) of this section may not diminish by an increase in the number of persons in the assistance unit. For example, the resource standard for an assistance unit of three may not be less than that set for a unit of two.</P>

                <P>(1) The groups of pregnant women or infants with incomes up to 133 percent of the Federal poverty level as specified under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act;</P>
                <P>(2) The group of children age 1 up to age 6 with incomes at 133 percent of the Federal poverty level as specified under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) of the Act;</P>
                <P>(3) The group of children age 6 up to age 19 born after September 30, 1983, with incomes up to 100 percent of the Federal poverty level as specified under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) of the Act; and</P>
                <P>(4) The groups of pregnant women or infants, children age 1 up to age 6, and children age 6 up to age 19, who are not eligible as a mandatory group, with incomes up to 185 percent of the Federal poverty level as specified under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) of the Act.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Outstation locations: general requirements.</E> (1) The agency must establish either—</P>

                <P>(i) Outstation locations at each disproportionate share hospital, as defined in section 1923(a)(1)(A) of the Act, and each Federally-qualified health center, as defined in section 1905(1)(2)(B) of the Act, participating in <PRTPAGE P="183"/>the Medicaid program and providing services to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and children; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Other outstation locations, which include at least some, disproportionate share hospitals and federally-qualified health centers, as specified under an alternative State plan that is submitted to and approved by CMS if the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(A) The State must demonstrate that the alternative plan for outstationing is equally effective as, or more effective than, a plan that would meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section in enabling the individuals described in paragraph (b) of this section to apply for and receive Medicaid; and</P>
                <P>(B) The State must provide assurances that the level of staffing and funding committed by the State under the alternative plan equals or exceeds the level of staffing and funding under a plan that would meet the requirements of establishing the outstation locations at the sites specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The agency must establish outstation locations at Indian health clinics operated by a tribe or tribal organization as these clinics are specifically included in the definition of Federally-qualified health centers under section 1905(l)(2)(B) of the Act and are also included in the definition of rural health clinics under part 491, subpart A of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(3) The agency may establish additional outstation locations at any other site where potentially eligible pregnant women or children receive services—for example, at school-linked service centers and family support centers. These additional sites may also include sites other than the main outstation location of those Federally-qualified health centers or disproportionate share hospitals providing services to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and to children and that operate more than one site.</P>
                <P>(4) The agency may, at its option, enter into reciprocal agreements with neighboring States to ensure that the groups described in paragraph (b) of this section who customarily receive services in a neighboring State have the opportunity to apply at outstation locations specified in paragraphs (c)(l) and (2) of this section.</P>

                <P>(2) “Initial processing” means taking applications, assisting applicants in completing the application, providing information and referrals, obtaining required documentation to complete processing of the application, assuring that the information contained on the application form is complete, and conducting any necessary interviews. It does not include evaluating the information contained on the application and the supporting documentation nor making a determination of eligibility or ineligibility.</P>
                <P>(3) The agency may, at its option, allow appropriate State eligibility workers assigned to outstation locations to evaluate the information contained on the application and the supporting documentation and make a determination of eligibility if the workers are authorized to determine eligibility for the agency which determines Medicaid eligibility under § 431.10 of this subchapter.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Staffing.</E> (1) Except for outstation locations that are infrequently used by the low-income eligibility groups, the State agency must have staff available at each outstation location during the regular office operating hours of the State Medicaid agency to accept applications and to assist applicants with the application process.</P>
                <P>(2) The agency may station staff at one outstation location or rotate staff among several locations as workload and staffing availability dictate.</P>
                <P>(3) The agency may use State employees, provider or contractor employees, or volunteers who have been properly trained to staff outstation locations under the following conditions:</P>

                <P>(i) State outstation intake staff may perform all eligibility processing functions, including the eligibility determination, if the staff is authorized to do so at the regular Medicaid intake office.<PRTPAGE P="184"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Provider or contractor employees and volunteers may perform only initial processing functions as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) Provider and contractor employees and volunteers are subject to the confidentiality of information rules specified in part 431, subpart F, of this subchapter, to the prohibition against reassignment of provider claims specified in § 447.10 of this subchapter, and to all other State or Federal laws concerning conflicts of interest.</P>
                <P>(5) At locations that are infrequently used by the designated low-income eligibility groups, the State agency may use volunteers, provider or contractor employees, or its own eligibility staff, or telephone assistance.</P>
                <P>(i) The agency must display a notice in a prominent place at the outstation location advising potential applicants of when outstation intake workers will be available.</P>
                <P>(ii) The notice must include a telephone number that applicants may call for assistance.</P>
                <P>(iii) The agency must comply with Federal and State laws and regulations governing the provision of adequate notice to persons who are blind or deaf or who are unable to read or understand the English language.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Renewal of individuals whose Medicaid eligibility is based on modified adjusted gross income methods (MAGI).</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the eligibility of Medicaid beneficiaries whose financial eligibility is determined using MAGI-based income must be renewed once every 12 months, and no more frequently than once every 12 months.</P>

                <P>(2) Renewal on basis of information available to agency. The agency must make a redetermination of eligibility without requiring information from the individual if able to do so based on reliable information contained in the individual's account or other more current information available to the agency, including but not limited to information accessed through any data bases accessed by the agency under <PRTPAGE P="190"/>§§ 435.948, 435.949 and 435.956 of this part. If the agency is able to renew eligibility based on such information, the agency must, consistent with the requirements of this subpart and subpart E of part 431 of this chapter, notify the individual—</P>
                <P>(i) Of the eligibility determination, and basis; and</P>
                <P>(ii) That the individual must inform the agency, through any of the modes permitted for submission of applications under § 435.907(a) of this subpart, if any of the information contained in such notice is inaccurate, but that the individual is not required to sign and return such notice if all information provided on such notice is accurate.</P>
                <P>(3) Use of a pre-populated renewal form. If the agency cannot renew eligibility in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the agency must—</P>
                <P>(i) Provide the individual with—</P>
                <P>(A) A renewal form containing information, as specified by the Secretary, available to the agency that is needed to renew eligibility.</P>
                <P>(B) At least 30 days from the date of the renewal form to respond and provide any necessary information through any of the modes of submission specified in § 435.907(a) of this part, and to sign the renewal form in a manner consistent with § 435.907(f) of the part;</P>
                <P>(C) Notice of the agency's decision concerning the renewal of eligibility in accordance with this subpart and subpart E of part 431 of this chapter;</P>
                <P>(ii) Verify any information provided by the beneficiary in accordance with §§ 435.945 through 435.956 of this part;</P>
                <P>(iii) Reconsider in a timely manner the eligibility of an individual who is terminated for failure to submit the renewal form or necessary information, if the individual subsequently submits the renewal form within 90 days after the date of termination, or a longer period elected by the State, without requiring a new application;</P>
                <P>(iv) Not require an individual to complete an in-person interview as part of the renewal process.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Redetermination of individuals whose Medicaid eligibility is determined on a basis other than modified adjusted gross income.</E> The agency must redetermine the eligibility of Medicaid beneficiaries excepted from modified adjusted gross income under § 435.603(j) of this part, for circumstances that may change, at least every 12 months. The agency must make a redetermination of eligibility in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if sufficient information is available to do so. The agency may adopt the procedures described at § 435.916(a)(3) for individuals whose eligibility cannot be renewed in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) The agency may consider blindness as continuing until the reviewing physician under § 435.531 of this part determines that a beneficiary's vision has improved beyond the definition of blindness contained in the plan; and</P>
                <P>(2) The agency may consider disability as continuing until the review team, under § 435.541 of this part, determines that a beneficiary's disability no longer meets the definition of disability contained in the plan.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for reporting changes.</E> The agency must have procedures designed to ensure that beneficiaries make timely and accurate reports of any change in circumstances that may affect their eligibility and that such changes may be reported through any of the modes for submission of applications described in § 435.907(a) of this part.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Agency action on information about changes.</E> (1) Consistent with the requirements of § 435.952 of this part, the agency must promptly redetermine eligibility between regular renewals of eligibility described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section whenever it receives information about a change in a beneficiary's circumstances that may affect eligibility.</P>
                <P>(i) For renewals of Medicaid beneficiaries whose financial eligibility is determined using MAGI-based income, the agency must limit any requests for additional information from the individual to information relating to such change in circumstance.</P>

                <P>(ii) If the agency has enough information available to it to renew eligibility with respect to all eligibility criteria, the agency may begin a new 12-month renewal period under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="191"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) If the agency has information about anticipated changes in a beneficiary's circumstances that may affect his or her eligibility, it must redetermine eligibility at the appropriate time based on such changes.</P>
                <P>(e) The agency may request from beneficiaries only the information needed to renew eligibility. Requests for non-applicant information must be conducted in accordance with § 435.907(e) of this part.</P>
                <P>(f) Determination of ineligibility and transmission of data pertaining to individuals no longer eligible for Medicaid.</P>
                <P>(1) Prior to making a determination of ineligibility, the agency must consider all bases of eligibility, consistent with § 435.911 of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) For individuals determined ineligible for Medicaid, the agency must determine potential eligibility for other insurance affordability programs and comply with the procedures set forth in § 435.1200(e) of this part.</P>
                <P>(g) Any renewal form or notice must be accessible to persons who are limited English proficient and persons with disabilities, consistent with § 435.905(b) of this subpart.</P>

                <P>(B) The agency may extend the reasonable opportunity period beyond 90 days for individuals declaring to be in a satisfactory immigration status if the agency determines that the individual is making a good faith effort to obtain any necessary documentation or the agency needs more time to verify the individual's status through other available electronic data sources or to assist the individual in obtaining documents needed to verify his or her status.</P>
                <P>(3) If, by the end of the reasonable opportunity period, the individual's citizenship or satisfactory immigration status has not been verified in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must take action within 30 days to terminate eligibility in accordance with part 431 subpart E (relating to notice and appeal rights) of this chapter, except that §§ 431.230 and 431.231 of this chapter (relating to maintaining and reinstating services) may be applied at State option.</P>

              <P>(a) In August 1972, the individual was entitled to OASDI and—</P>

              <P>(2) He would have been eligible for cash assistance if he had applied, and the Medicaid plan covered this optional group; or</P>
              <P>(3) He would have been eligible for cash assistance if he were not in a medical institution or intermediate care facility, and the Medicaid plan covered this optional group.</P>
              <P>(b) The individual would currently be eligible for cash assistance except that the increase in OASDI under Pub. L. 92-336 raised his income over the limit allowed under the cash assistance program. This includes an individual who—</P>
              <P>(1) Meets all current requirements for cash assistance except for the requirement to file an application; or</P>
              <P>(2) Would meet all current requirements for cash assistance if he were not in a medical institution or intermediate care facility, and the Medicaid plan covers this optional group.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Individuals deemed to be receiving AFDC.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Medicaid agency must provide Medicaid to individuals deemed to be receiving AFDC, as specified in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The State must deem individuals to be receiving AFDC who are denied a cash payment from the title IV-A State agency solely because the amount of the AFDC payment would be less than $10.</P>
              <P>(c) The State may deem participants in a work supplementation program to be receiving AFDC under section 414(g) of the Act. This section permits States, for purposes of title XIX, to deem an individual and any child or relative of the individual (or other individual living in the same household) to be receiving AFDC, if the individual—</P>
              <P>(1) Participates in a State-operated work supplementation program under section 414 of the Act; and</P>
              <P>(2) Would be eligible for an AFDC cash payment if the individual were not participating in the work supplementation program.</P>
              <P>(d) The State must deem to be receiving AFDC those individuals who are denied AFDC payments from the title IV-A State agency solely because that agency is recovering an overpayment.</P>
              <P>(e) The State must deem to be receiving AFDC individuals described in section 473(a)(1) of the Act—</P>
              <P>(1) For whom an adoption assistance agreement is in effect under title IV-E of the Act, whether or not adoption assistance is being provided or an interlocutory or other judicial decree of adoption has been issued; or</P>
              <P>(2) For whom foster care maintenance payments are made under title IV-E of the Act.</P>
              <P>(f) The State must deem an individual to be receiving AFDC if a new collection or increased collection of child or spousal support under title IV-D of the Social Security Act results in the termination of AFDC eligibility in accordance with section 406(h) of the Social Security Act. States must continue to provide Medicaid for four consecutive calendar months, beginning with the first month of AFDC ineligibility, to each dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is living (including the eligible spouse of such relative as described in section 406(b) of the Social Security Act) who:</P>
              <P>(1) Becomes ineligible for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984; and</P>
              <P>(2) Has received AFDC for at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which the individual becomes ineligible for AFDC; and</P>
              <P>(3) Becomes ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly as a result of the initiation of or an increase in the amount of a child or spousal support collection under title IV-D.</P>

              <P>(g)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, individuals who are eligible for extended Medicaid lose this coverage if they move to another State during the 4-month period. However, if they move back to and reestablish residence in the State in <PRTPAGE P="219"/>which they have extended coverage, they are eligible for any of the months remaining in the 4-month period in which they are residents of the State.</P>
              <P>(2) If a State has chosen in its State plan to provide Medicaid to non-residents, the State may continue to provide the 4-month extended benefits to individuals who have moved to another State.</P>
              <P>(h) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The new collection or increased collection of child or spousal support results in the termination of AFDC eligibility when it actively causes or contributes to the termination. This occurs when:</P>
              <P>(i) The change in support collection in and of itself is sufficient to cause ineligibility. This rule applies even if the support collection must be added to other, stable income. It also applies even if other independent factors, alone or in combination with each other, might simultaneously cause ineligibility; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The change in support contributes to ineligibility but does not by itself cause ineligibility. Ineligibility must result when the change in support is combined with other changes in income or changes in other circumstances and the other changes in income or circumstances cannot alone or in combination result in termination without the change in support.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases of increases in the amounts of both the support collections and earned income, eligibility under this section does not preclude eligibility under 45 CFR 233.20(a)(14) or section 1925 of the Social Security Act (which was added by section 303(a) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 1396r-6)). Extended periods resulting from both an increase in the amount of the support collection and from an increase in earned income must run concurrently.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Newborn children.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The agency must provide Medicaid eligibility to a child born to a woman who has applied for, has been determined eligible and is receiving Medicaid on the date of the child's birth. The child is deemed to have applied and been found eligible for Medicaid on the date of birth and remains eligible for one year so long as the woman remains (or would remain if pregnant) eligible and the child is a member of the woman's household. This provision applies in instances where the labor and delivery services were furnished prior to the date of application and covered by Medicaid based on retroactive eligibility.</P>

              <P>(b) The agency must provide Medicaid eligibility in the same manner described in paragraph (a) of this section to a child born to an otherwise-eligible qualified alien woman subject to the 5-year bar so long as the woman has filed a complete Medicaid application, including but not limited to meeting residency, income and resource requirements, has been determined eligible, is receiving Medicaid on the date of the child's birth, and remains (or <PRTPAGE P="221"/>would remain if pregnant) Medicaid eligible. All standard Medicaid application procedures apply, including timely determination of eligibility and adequate notice of the agency's decision concerning eligibility. A 5-year bar qualified alien receiving emergency medical services only under § 435.139 of this chapter is considered to be Medicaid-eligible and receiving Medicaid for purposes of this provision. With respect to whether the mother remains (or would remain if pregnant) eligible for Medicaid after the birth of the child, the State must determine whether a 5-year bar qualified alien would remain eligible for emergency services under § 435.139 of this chapter. In determining whether the woman would remain eligible for these services, the State must consider whether the woman would remain eligible if pregnant. This provision applies in instances where the labor and delivery services were furnished prior to the date of application and covered by Medicaid based on retroactive eligibility.</P>
              <P>(c) The agency must provide Medicaid eligibility in the same manner described in paragraph (a) of this section to a child born to an otherwise-eligible non-qualified alien woman so long as the woman has filed a complete Medicaid application (other than providing a social security number or demonstrating immigration status), including but not limited to meeting residency, income and resource requirements, has been determined eligible, is receiving Medicaid on the date of the child's birth, and remains (or would remain if pregnant) Medicaid eligible. All standard Medicaid application procedures apply, including timely determination of eligibility and adequate notice of the agency's decision concerning eligibility. A non-qualified alien receiving emergency medical services only under § 435.139 of this chapter is considered to be Medicaid-eligible and receiving Medicaid for purposes of this provision. With respect to whether the mother remains (or would remain if pregnant) eligible for Medicaid after the birth of the child, the State must determine whether a non-qualified alien would remain eligible for emergency services under § 435.139 of this chapter.

This provision applies in instances where the labor and delivery services were furnished prior to the date of application and covered by Medicaid based on retroactive eligibility.</P>

              <P>(i) Providing basic information to individuals about another State's Medicaid program, and information about the availability of health care services and facilities in another State.</P>
              <P>(ii) Assisting an individual in locating an institution in another State provided the individual is capable of indicating intent and independently decides to move.</P>
              <P>(3) When a competent individual leaves the facility in which the individual is placed by a State, that individual's State of residency for Medicaid purposes is the State where the individual is physically located.</P>
              <P>(4) Where placement is initiated by a State because the State lacks a sufficient number of appropriate facilities to provide services to its residents, the State making the placement is the individual's State of residence for Medicaid purposes.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Individuals receiving title IV-E payments.</E> For individuals of any age who are receiving Federal payment for foster care and adoption assistance under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, the State of residence is the State where the child lives.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Individuals under age 21.</E> (1) For any individual who is emancipated from his or her parents or who is married and capable of indicating intent, the State of residence is the State where the individual is living with the intention to remain there permanently or for an indefinite period.</P>
              <P>(2) For any individual not residing in an institution as defined in paragraph (b) whose Medicaid eligibility is based on blindness or disability, the State of residence is the State in which the individual is living.</P>
              <P>(3) For any other non-institutionalized individual not subject to paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, the State of residence is determined in accordance with 45 CFR 233.40, the rules governing residence under the AFDC program.</P>
              <P>(4) For any institutionalized individual who is neither married nor emancipated, the State of residence is—</P>
              <P>(i) The parents' or legal guardian's current State of residence at the time of placement; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The current State of residence of the parent or legal guardian who files the application, if the individual is institutionalized in that State. If a legal guardian has been appointed and the parental rights are terminated, the State of residence of the guardian is used instead of the parent's.</P>
              <P>(iii) The State of residence of the individual or party who files an application is used if the individual has been abandoned by his or her parent(s), does not have a legal guardian and is institutionalized in that State.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Individuals age 21 and over.</E> (1) For any individual not residing in an institution as defined in paragraph (b), the <PRTPAGE P="228"/>State of residence is the State where the individual is—</P>
              <P>(i) Living with the intention to remain there permanently or for an indefinite period (or if incapable of stating intent, where the individual is living); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Living and which the individual entered with a job commitment or seeking employment (whether or not currently employed).</P>
              <P>(2) For any institutionalized individual who became incapable of indicating intent before age 21, the State of residence is—</P>
              <P>(i) That of the parents applying for Medicaid on the individual's behalf, if the parents reside in separate States;</P>
              <P>(ii) The parent's or legal guardian's State of residence at the time of placement; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The current State of residence of the parent or legal guardian who files the application, if the individual is institutionalized in that State. If a legal guardian has been appointed and parental rights are terminated, the State of residence of the guardian is used instead of the legal parent's.</P>
              <P>(iv) The State of residence of the individual or party who files an application is used if the individual has been abandoned by his or her parent(s), does not have a legal guardian and is institutionalized in that State.</P>
              <P>(3) For any institutionalized individual who became incapable of indicating intent at or after age 21, the State of residence is the State in which the individual is physically present, except where another State makes a placement.</P>
              <P>(4) For any other institutionalized individual, the State of residence is the State where the individual is living with the intention to remain there permanently or for an indefinite period.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Specific prohibitions.</E> (1) The agency may not deny Medicaid eligibility because an individual has not resided in the State for a specified period.</P>
              <P>(2) The agency may not deny Medicaid eligibility to an individual in an institution, who satisfies the residency rules set forth in this section, on the grounds that the individual did not establish residence in the State before entering the institution.</P>
              <P>(3) The agency may not deny or terminate a resident's Medicaid eligibility because of that person's temporary absence from the State if the person intends to return when the purpose of the absence has been accomplished, unless another State has determined that the person is a resident there for purposes of Medicaid.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Interstate agreements.</E> A State may have a written agreement with another State setting forth rules and procedures resolving cases of disputed residency. These agreements may establish criteria other than those specified in paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section, but must not include criteria that result in loss of residency in both States or that are prohibited by paragraph (i) of this section. The agreements must contain a procedure for providing Medicaid to individuals pending resolution of the case.</P>
              <FP>States may use interstate agreements for purposes other than cases of disputed residency to facilitate administration of the program, and to facilitate the placement and adoption of title IV-E individuals when the child and his or her adoptive parent(s) move into another State.</FP>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Continued Medicaid for institutionalized beneficiaries.</E> An agency is providing Medicaid to an institutionalized beneficiary who, as a result of this section, would be considered a resident of a different State—</P>
              <P>(1) The agency must continue to provide Medicaid to that beneficiary from June 24, 1983 until July 5, 1984 unless it makes arrangements with another State of residence to provide Medicaid at an earlier date; and</P>
              <P>(2) Those arrangements must not include provisions prohibited by paragraph (g) of this section.</P>

              <P>For purposes of this section, the term “citizenship” includes status as a “national of the United States” as defined by section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(22)) to include both citizens of the United States and non-citizen nationals of the United States.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Primary evidence of citizenship and identity.</E> The following evidence must be accepted as satisfactory documentary evidence of both identity and citizenship:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">A U.S. passport.</E> The Department of State issues this. A U.S. passport does not have to be currently valid to be accepted as evidence of U.S. citizenship, as long as it was originally issued without limitation.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

                <P>Spouses and children were sometimes included on one passport through 1980. U.S. passports issued after 1980 show only one person. Consequently, the citizenship and identity of the included person can be established when one of these passports is presented. Exception: Do not accept any passport as evidence of U.S. citizenship when it <PRTPAGE P="230"/>was issued with a limitation. However, such a passport may be used as proof of identity.</P>

(This provision is not effective until such time as a State makes providing evidence of citizenship a condition of issuing a driver's license and evidence that the license holder is a citizen is included on the license or in a system of records available to the Medicaid agency. States must ensure that the process complies with this statutory provision in section 6036 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. CMS will monitor compliance of States implementing this provision.)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Secondary evidence of citizenship.</E> If primary evidence from the list in paragraph (a) of this section is unavailable, an applicant or beneficiary should provide satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship from the list specified in this section to establish citizenship and satisfactory documentary evidence from paragraph (e) of this section to establish identity, in accordance with the rules specified in this section.</P>

              <P>(1) A U.S. public birth certificate showing birth in one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico (if born on or after January 13, 1941), Guam (on or after April 10, 1899), the Virgin Islands of the U.S. (on or after January 17, 1917), American Samoa, Swain's Island, or the Northern Mariana Islands (after November 4, 1986 (NMI local time)). A State, at its option, may use a cross match with a State vital statistics agency to document a birth record. The birth record document may be issued by the State, Commonwealth, Territory, or local jurisdiction. It must have been recorded before the person was 5 years of age. A delayed birth record document that is recorded at or after 5 years of age is considered fourth level evidence of citizenship. (<E T="04">Note:</E> If the document shows the individual was born in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the U.S., or the Northern Mariana Islands before these areas became part of the U.S., the individual may be a collectively naturalized citizen. Collective naturalization occurred on certain dates listed for each of the territories.) The following will establish U.S. citizenship for collectively naturalized individuals:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Puerto Rico</E>:</P>
              <P>(A) Evidence of birth in Puerto Rico on or after April 11, 1899 and the applicant's statement that he or she was residing in the U.S., a U.S. possession, or Puerto Rico on January 13, 1941; or</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">A Certification of Report of Birth (DS-1350).</E> The Department of State issues a DS-1350 to U.S. citizens in the U.S. who were born outside the U.S. and acquired U.S. citizenship at birth, based on the information shown on the FS-240. When the birth was recorded as a Consular Report of Birth (FS-240), certified copies of the Certification of Report of Birth Abroad (DS-1350) can be issued by the Department of State in Washington, DC. The DS-1350 contains the same information as that on the current version of Consular Report of Birth FS-240. The DS-1350 is not issued outside the U.S.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">A Report of Birth Abroad of a U.S. Citizen (Form FS-240).</E> The Department of State consular office prepares and issues this. A Consular Report of Birth can be prepared only at an American consular office overseas while the child is under the age of 18. Children born outside the U.S. to U.S. military personnel usually have one of these.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">A Certification of birth issued by the Department of State (Form FS-545 or DS-1350).</E> Before November 1, 1990, Department of State consulates also issued Form FS-545 along with the prior version of the FS-240. In 1990, U.S. consulates ceased to issue Form FS-545. Treat an FS-545 the same as the DS-1350.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">A U.S. Citizen I.D. card.</E> (This form was issued until the 1980s by INS. Although no longer issued, holders of this document may still use it consistent with the provisions of section 1903(x) of the Act.) INS issued the I-179 from 1960 until 1973. It revised the form and renumbered it as Form I-197. INS issued the I-197 from 1973 until April 7, 1983. INS issued Form I-179 and I-197 to naturalized U.S. citizens living near the Canadian or Mexican border who needed it for frequent border crossings. Although neither form is currently issued, either form that was previously issued is still valid.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">A Northern Mariana Identification Card</E> (I-873). (Issued by the DHS to a collectively naturalized citizen of the United States who was born in the Northern Mariana Islands before November 4, 1986.) The former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued the I-873 to a collectively naturalized citizen of the U.S. who was born in the NMI before November 4, 1986. The card is no longer issued, but those previously issued are still valid.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">An American Indian Card (I-872) issued by the Department of Homeland Security with the classification code “KIC.”</E> (Issued by DHS to identify U.S. citizen members of the Texas Band of Kickapoos living near the United States/Mexican border.) DHS issues this card to identify a member of the Texas Band of Kickapoos living near the U.S./Mexican border. A classification code “KIC” and a statement on the back denote U.S. citizenship</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">A final adoption decree showing the child's name and U.S. place of birth.</E> The adoption decree must show the child's name and U.S. place of birth. In situations where an adoption is not finalized and the State in which the child was born will not release a birth certificate prior to final adoption, a statement from a State approved adoption agency that shows the child's name and U.S. place of birth is acceptable. The adoption agency must state in the certification that the source of the place of birth information is an original birth certificate.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Evidence of U.S. Civil Service employment before June 1, 1976.</E> The document must show employment by the U.S. government before June 1, 1976. Individuals employed by the U.S. Civil Service prior to June 1, 1976 had to be U.S. citizens.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">U.S. Military Record showing a U.S. place of birth.</E> T he document must show a U.S. place of birth (for example <PRTPAGE P="232"/>a DD-214 or similar official document showing a U.S. place of birth.)</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">A data verification with the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program for naturalized citizens.</E> A State may conduct a verification with SAVE to determine if an individual is a naturalized citizen, provided that such verification is conducted consistent with the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding or other agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authorizing verification of claims to U.S. citizenship through SAVE, including but not limited to provision of the individual's alien registration number if required by DHS.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Child Citizenship Act.</E> Adopted or biological children born outside the United States may establish citizenship obtained automatically under section 320 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1431), as amended by the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-395, enacted on October 30, 2000). The State must obtain documentary evidence that verifies that at any time on or after February 27, 2001, the following conditions have been met:</P>
              <P>(i) At least one parent of the child is a United States citizen by either birth or naturalization (as verified under the requirements of this part);</P>

              <P>(v) If adopted, the child satisfies the requirements of section 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1) pertaining to international adoptions (admission for lawful permanent residence as IR-3 (child adopted outside the United States)), or as IR-4 (child coming to the United States to be adopted) with final adoption having subsequently occurred).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Third level evidence of citizenship.</E> Third level evidence of U.S. citizenship is documentary evidence of satisfactory reliability that is used when both primary and secondary evidence is unavailable. Third level evidence may be used only when the applicant or beneficiary alleges birth in the U.S. A second document from paragraph (e) of this section to establish identity must also be presented:</P>
              <P>(1) Extract of a hospital record on hospital letterhead established at the time of the person's birth that was created 5 years before the initial application date and that indicates a U.S. place of birth. (For children under 16 the document must have been created near the time of birth or 5 years before the date of application.) Do not accept a souvenir “birth certificate” issued by the hospital.</P>
              <P>(2) Life, health, or other insurance record showing a U.S. place of birth that was created at least 5 years before the initial application date that indicates a U.S. place of birth. (For children under 16 the document must have been created near the time of birth or 5 years before the date of application.) Life or health insurance records may show biographical information for the person including place of birth; the record can be used to establish U.S. citizenship when it shows a U.S. place of birth.</P>
              <P>(3) Religious record recorded in the U.S. within 3 months of birth showing the birth occurred in the U.S. and showing either the date of the birth or the individual's age at the time the record was made. The record must be an official record recorded with the religious organization. Caution: In questionable cases (for example, where the child's religious record was recorded near a U.S. international border and the child may have been born outside the U.S.), the State must consider verifying the religious record and/or documenting that the mother was in the U.S. at the time of the birth.</P>
              <P>(4) Early school record showing a U.S. place of birth. The school record must show the name of the child, the date of admission to the school, the date of birth (or age at the time the record was made), a U.S. place of birth, and the name(s) and place(s) of birth of the applicant's parents.</P>

              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(2) At State option, a State may use a cross match with a Federal or State governmental, public assistance, law enforcement or corrections agency's data system to establish identity if the agency establishes and certifies true identity of individuals. Such agencies may include food stamps, child support, corrections, including juvenile detention, motor vehicle, or child protective services. The State Medicaid Agency is still responsible for assuring the accuracy of the identity determination.</P>
              <P>(3) At State option, a State may accept three or more documents that together reasonably corroborate the identity of an individual provided such documents have not been used to establish the individual's citizenship and the individual submitted second or third tier evidence of citizenship. The State must first ensure that no other evidence of identity is available to the individual prior to accepting such documents. Such documents must at a minimum contain the individual's name, plus any additional information establishing the individual's identity. All documents used must contain consistent identifying information. These documents include employer identification cards, high school and college diplomas from accredited institutions (including general education and high school equivalency diplomas), marriage certificates, divorce decrees, and property deeds/titles.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Special identity rules for children.</E> For children under 16, a clinic, doctor, hospital or school record may be accepted for purposes of establishing identity. School records may include nursery or daycare records and report cards. If the State accepts such records, it must verify them with the issuing school. If none of the above documents in the preceding groups are available, an affidavit may be used. An affidavit is only acceptable if it is signed under penalty of perjury by a parent, guardian or caretaker relative (as defined in the regulations at 45 CFR 233.90(c)(v)) stating the date and place of the birth of the child and cannot be used if an affidavit for citizenship was provided. The affidavit is not required to be notarized. A State may accept an identity affidavit on behalf of a child under the age of 18 in instances when school ID cards and drivers' licenses are not available to the individual in that area until that age.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Special identity rules for disabled individuals in institutional care facilities.</E> A State may accept an identity affidavit signed under penalty of perjury by a residential care facility director or administrator on behalf of an institutionalized individual in the facility. States should first pursue all other means of verifying identity prior to accepting an affidavit. The affidavit is not required to be notarized.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Special populations needing assistance.</E> States must assist individuals to secure satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship when because of incapacity of mind or body the individual would be unable to comply with the requirement to present satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship in <PRTPAGE P="235"/>a timely manner and the individual lacks a representative to assist him or her.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Documentary evidence.</E> (1) All documents must be either originals or copies certified by the issuing agency. Uncertified copies, including notarized copies, shall not be accepted.</P>
              <P>(2) States must maintain copies of citizenship and identification documents in the case record or electronic data base and make these copies available for compliance audits.</P>
              <P>(3) States may permit applicants and beneficiaries to submit such documentary evidence without appearing in person at a Medicaid office. States may accept original documents in person, by mail, or by a guardian or authorized representative.</P>
              <P>(4) If documents are determined to be inconsistent with pre-existing information, are counterfeit, or altered, States should investigate for potential fraud and abuse, including but not limited to, referral to the appropriate State and Federal law enforcement agencies.</P>
              <P>(5) Presentation of documentary evidence of citizenship is a one time activity; once a person's citizenship is documented and recorded in a State database subsequent changes in eligibility should not require repeating the documentation of citizenship unless later evidence raises a question of the person's citizenship. The State need only check its databases to verify that the individual already established citizenship.</P>
              <P>(6) CMS requires that as a check against fraud, using currently available automated capabilities, States will conduct a match of the applicant's name against the corresponding Social Security number that was provided. In addition, in cooperation with other agencies of the Federal government, CMS encourages States to use automated capabilities to verify citizenship and identity of Medicaid applicants. Automated capabilities may fall within the computer matching provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, and CMS will explore any implementation issues that may arise with respect to those requirements. When these capabilities become available, States will be required to match files for individuals who used third or fourth tier documents to verify citizenship and documents to verify identity, and CMS will make available to States necessary information in this regard. States must ensure that all case records within this category will be so identified and made available to conduct these automated matches. CMS may also require States to match files for individuals who used first or second level documents to verify citizenship as well. CMS may provide further guidance to States with respect to actions required in a case of a negative match.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Record retention.</E> The State must retain documents in accordance with 45 CFR 75.361.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Reasonable opportunity to present satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship.</E> States must give an applicant or beneficiary a reasonable opportunity to submit satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship before taking action affecting the individual's eligibility for Medicaid. The time States give for submitting documentation of citizenship should be consistent with the time allowed to submit documentation to establish other facets of eligibility for which documentation is requested.

              <P>(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in determining financial responsibility of relatives and other persons for individuals under Medicaid, the agency must use the following financial eligibility requirements and methodologies.</P>
              <P>(1) Except for a spouse of an individual or a parent for a child who is under age 21 or blind or disabled, the agency must not consider income and resources of any relative as available to an individual.</P>
              <P>(2) In relation to individuals under 21 (as described in section 1905(a)(i) of the Act), the financial responsibility requirements and methodologies include considering the income and resources of parents or spouses whose income and resources would be considered if the individual under age 21 were dependent under the State's approved AFDC plan, whether or not they are actually contributed. These requirements and methodologies must be applied in accordance with provisions of the State's approved AFDC plan.</P>
              <P>(3) When a couple ceases to live together, the agency must count only the income and resources of the individual in determining his or her eligibility, beginning the first month following the month the couple ceases to live together.</P>
              <P>(b) The agency may apply income and resource methodologies that are less restrictive than the cash assistance methodologies as specified in the State plan in accordance with § 436.601(d).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Income eligibility.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The agency must determine income eligibility of medically needy individuals in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Budget periods.</E> (1) The agency must use budget periods of not more than 6 months to compute income. The agency may use more than one budget period.</P>
                <P>(2) The agency must include in the budget period in which income is computed all or part of the 3-month retroactive period specified in § 435.914. The budget period can begin no earlier then the first month in the retroactive period in which the individual received covered services.</P>
                <P>(3) If the agency elects to begin the first budget period for the medically needy in any month of the 3-month period prior to the date of application in which the applicant received covered services, this election applies to all medically needy groups.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility based on countable income.</E> If countable income determined under paragraph (b) of this section is <PRTPAGE P="240"/>equal to or less than the applicable income standard under § 436.814, the individual is eligible for Medicaid.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Deduction of incurred medical expenses.</E> If countable income exceeds the income standard, the agency must deduct from income medical expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially responsible relatives that are not subject to payment by a third party. An expense is incurred on the date liability for the expense arises. The agency must determine deductible incurred expenses in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of this section and deduct those expenses in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required deductions based on kinds of services.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income, the agency must include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Expenses for Medicare and other health insurance premiums, and deductibles or coinsurance charges, including enrollment fees, copayments, or deductibles imposed under § 447.52, § 447.53, or § 447.54 of this chapter;</P>
                <P>(2) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or financially responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that are recognized under State law but not included in the plan;</P>
                <P>(3) Expenses incurred by the individual or family or by financially responsible relatives for necessary medical and remedial services that are included in the plan, including those that exceed agency limitations on amount, duration or scope of services;</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination of deductible incurred expenses: Required deductions based on the age of bills.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, in determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income, the agency must include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) For the first budget period or periods that include only months before the month of application for medical assistance, expenses incurred during such period or periods, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility;</P>
                <P>(2) For the first prospective budget period that also includes any of the 3 months before the month of application for medical assistance, expenses incurred during such budget period, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility;</P>
                <P>(3) For the first prospective budget period that includes none of the months preceding the month of application, expenses incurred during such budget period and any of the 3 preceding months, whether paid or unpaid, to the extent that the expenses have not been deducted previously in establishing eligibility;</P>
                <P>(4) For any of the 3 months preceding the month of application that are not includable under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, expenses incurred in the 3-month period that were a current liability of the individual in any such month for which a spenddown calculation is made and that had not been previously deducted from income in establishing eligibility for medical assistance;</P>
                <P>(5) Current payments (that is, payments made in the current budget period) on other expenses incurred before the current budget period and not previously deducted from income in any budget period in establishing eligibility for such period; and</P>
                <P>(6) If the individual's eligibility for medical assistance was established in each such preceding period, expenses incurred before the current budget period but not previously deducted from income, to the extent that such expenses are unpaid and are:</P>
                <P>(i) Described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Are carried over from the preceding budget period or periods because the individual had a spenddown liability in each such preceding period that was met without deducting all such incurred, unpaid expenses.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Determination of deductible incurred medical expenses: Optional deductions.</E> In determining incurred medical expenses to be deducted from income, the agency—</P>

                <P>(1) May include medical institutional expenses (other than expenses in acute care facilities) projected to the end of <PRTPAGE P="241"/>the budget period at the Medicaid reimbursement rate;</P>
                <P>(2) May, to the extent determined by the agency and specified in its approved plan, include expenses incurred earlier than the third month before the month of application; and</P>
                <P>(3) May set reasonable limits on the amount to be deducted for expenses specified in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (g)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Order of deduction.</E> The agency must deduct incurred medical expenses that are deductible under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, in the order prescribed under one of the following three options:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Type of service.</E> Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in the following order based on type of service:</P>
                <P>(i) Cost-sharing expenses as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) Services not included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section but that exceed agency limitations on amount, duration, or scope of services.</P>
                <P>(iv) Services included in the State plan as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section but that are within agency limitations on amount, duration, or scope of services.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Chronological order by service date.</E> Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each service is furnished, or in the case of insurance premiums, coinsurance, or deductibles charges the date such amounts are due. Expenses for services furnished on the same day may be deducted in any reasonable order established by the State.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Chronological order by bill submission date.</E> Under this option, the agency deducts expenses in chronological order by the date each bill is submitted to the agency by the individual. If more than one bill is submitted at one time, the agency must deduct the bills from income in the order prescribed in either paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Eligibility based on incurred medical expenses.</E> (1) Whether a State elects partial or full month coverage, an individual who is expected to contribute a portion of his or her income toward the costs of institutional care or home and community-based services under § 436.832 is eligible on the first day of the applicable budget (spenddown) period—</P>
                <P>(i) If his or her spenddown liability is met after the first day of the budget period; and</P>
                <P>(ii) If beginning eligibility after the first day of the budget period makes the individual's share of health care expenses under § 436.832 greater than the individual's contributable income determined under this section.</P>
                <P>(2) At the end of the prospective period specified in paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3) of this section and any subsequent prospective period or, if earlier, when any significant change occurs, the agency must reconcile the projected amounts with the actual amounts incurred, or with changes in circumstances, to determine if the adjusted deduction of incurred expenses reduces income to the income standard.</P>
                <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, if agencies elect partial month coverage, an individual is eligible for Medicaid on the day that the deduction of incurred health care expenses (and of projected institutional expenses if the agency elects the option under paragraph (g)(1) of this section) reduces income to the income standard.</P>
                <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, if agencies elect full month coverage, an individual is eligible on the first day of the month in which spenddown liability is met.</P>
                <P>(5) Expenses used to meet spenddown liability are not reimbursable under Medicaid. Therefore, to the extent necessary to prevent the transfer of an individual's spenddown liability to the Medicaid program, States must reduce the amount of provider charges that would otherwise be reimbursable under Medicaid.</P>

              <P>(1) Have been developed in accordance with standards specified in § 438.5 and generally accepted actuarial principles and practices. Any proposed differences among capitation rates according to covered populations must be based on valid rate development standards and not based on the rate of Federal financial participation associated with the covered populations.</P>
              <P>(2) Be appropriate for the populations to be covered and the services to be furnished under the contract.</P>
              <P>(3) Be adequate to meet the requirements on MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs in §§ 438.206, 438.207, and 438.208.</P>

              <P>(5) Take into account the MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's past medical loss ratio, as calculated and reported under § 438.8, in the development of the capitation rates, and consider the projected medical loss ratio in accordance with § 438.4(b)(9).</P>
              <P>(6) Consistent with paragraph (g) of this section, if risk adjustment is applied, select a risk adjustment methodology that uses generally accepted models and apply it in a budget neutral manner across all MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs in the program to calculate adjustments to the payments as necessary.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Base data.</E> (1) States must provide all the validated encounter data, FFS data (as appropriate), and audited financial reports (as defined in § 438.3(m)) that demonstrate experience for the populations to be served by the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP to the actuary developing the capitation rates for at least the three most recent and complete years prior to the rating period.</P>
              <P>(2) States and their actuaries must use the most appropriate data, with the basis of the data being no older than from the 3 most recent and complete years prior to the rating period, for setting capitation rates. Such base data must be derived from the Medicaid population, or, if data on the Medicaid population is not available, derived from a similar population and adjusted to make the utilization and price data comparable to data from the Medicaid population. Data must be in accordance with actuarial standards for data quality and an explanation of why that specific data is used must be provided in the rate certification.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Exception.</E> (i) States that are unable to base their rates on data meeting the qualifications in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="257"/>(c)(2) of this section that the basis of the data be no older than from the 3 most recent and complete years prior to the rating period may request approval for an exception; the request must describe why an exception is necessary and describe the actions the state intends to take to come into compliance with those requirements.</P>
              <P>(ii) States that request an exception from the base data standards established in this section must set forth a corrective action plan to come into compliance with the base data standards no later than 2 years from the rating period for which the deficiency was identified.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Trend.</E> Each trend must be reasonable and developed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices. Trend must be developed primarily from actual experience of the Medicaid population or from a similar population.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Non-benefit component of the rate.</E> The development of the non-benefit component of the rate must include reasonable, appropriate, and attainable expenses related to MCO, PIHP, or PAHP administration, taxes, licensing and regulatory fees, contribution to reserves, risk margin, cost of capital, and other operational costs associated with the provision of services identified in § 438.3(c)(1)(ii) to the populations covered under the contract.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Adjustments.</E> Each adjustment must reasonably support the development of an accurate base data set for purposes of rate setting, address appropriate programmatic changes, reflect the health status of the enrolled population, or reflect non-benefit costs, and be developed in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Risk adjustment.</E> Prospective or retrospective risk adjustment methodologies must be developed in a budget neutral manner consistent with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this part, the following terms have the indicated meanings:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Base amount</E> is the starting amount, calculated according to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, available for pass-through payments to hospitals in a given contract year subject to the schedule in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Incentive arrangement</E> means any payment mechanism under which a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may receive additional funds over and above the capitation rates it was paid for meeting targets specified in the contract.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Pass-through payment</E> is any amount required by the State to be added to the contracted payment rates, and considered in calculating the actuarially sound capitation rate, between the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP and hospitals, physicians, or nursing facilities that is not for the following purposes: A specific service or benefit provided to a specific enrollee covered under the contract; a provider payment methodology permitted under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section for services and enrollees covered under the contract; a subcapitated payment arrangement for a specific set of services and enrollees covered under the contract; GME payments; or FQHC or RHC wrap around payments.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Risk corridor</E> means a risk sharing mechanism in which States and MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs may share in profits and losses under the contract outside of a predetermined threshold amount.</P>

The targets for a withhold arrangement are distinct from general operational requirements under the contract. Arrangements that withhold a portion of a capitation rate for noncompliance with general operational requirements are a penalty and not a withhold arrangement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic requirements.</E> (1) If used in the payment arrangement between the State and the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP, all applicable risk-sharing mechanisms, such as reinsurance, risk corridors, or stop-loss limits, must be described in the contract, and must be developed in <PRTPAGE P="258"/>accordance with § 438.4, the rate development standards in § 438.5, and generally accepted actuarial principles and practices.</P>
              <P>(2) Contracts with incentive arrangements may not provide for payment in excess of 105 percent of the approved capitation payments attributable to the enrollees or services covered by the incentive arrangement, since such total payments will not be considered to be actuarially sound.

              <P>(v) Necessary for the specified activities, targets, performance measures, or quality-based outcomes that support program initiatives as specified in the State's quality strategy at § 438.340.</P>
              <P>(3) Contracts that provide for a withhold arrangement must ensure that the capitation payment minus any portion of the withhold that is not reasonably achievable is actuarially sound as determined by an actuary. The total amount of the withhold, achievable or not, must be reasonable and take into consideration the MCO's, PIHP's or PAHP's financial operating needs accounting for the size and characteristics of the populations covered under the contract, as well as the MCO's, PIHP's or PAHP's capital reserves as measured by the risk-based capital level, months of claims reserve, or other appropriate measure of reserves. The data, assumptions, and methodologies used to determine the portion of the withhold that is reasonably achievable must be submitted as part of the documentation required under § 438.7(b)(6). For all withhold arrangements, the contract must provide that the arrangement is—</P>
              <P>(i) For a fixed period of time and performance is measured during the rating period under the contract in which the withhold arrangement is applied.</P>
              <P>(ii) Not to be renewed automatically.</P>
              <P>(iii) Made available to both public and private contractors under the same terms of performance.</P>
              <P>(iv) Does not condition MCO, PIHP, or PAHP participation in the withhold arrangement on the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP entering into or adhering to intergovernmental transfer agreements.</P>
              <P>(v) Necessary for the specified activities, targets, performance measures, or quality-based outcomes that support program initiatives as specified in the State's quality strategy under § 438.340.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Delivery system and provider payment initiatives under MCO, PIHP, or PAHP contracts</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as specified in this paragraph (c), in paragraph (d) of this section, in a specific provision of Title XIX, or in another regulation implementing a Title XIX provision related to payments to providers, that is applicable to managed care programs, the State may not direct the MCO's, PIHP's or PAHP's expenditures under the contract.</P>
              <P>(i) The State may require the MCO, PIHP or PAHP to implement value-based purchasing models for provider reimbursement, such as pay for performance arrangements, bundled payments, or other service payment models intended to recognize value or outcomes over volume of services.</P>
              <P>(ii) The State may require MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs to participate in a multi-payer or Medicaid-specific delivery system reform or performance improvement initiative.</P>

              <P>(ii) Any contract arrangements that direct the MCO's, PIHP's or PAHP's expenditures under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section must also demonstrate, in writing, that the arrangement—</P>
              <P>(A) Must make participation in the value-based purchasing initiative, delivery system reform or performance improvement initiative available, using the same terms of performance, to a class of providers providing services under the contract related to the reform or improvement initiative;</P>
              <P>(B) Must use a common set of performance measures across all of the payers and providers;</P>
              <P>(C) May not set the amount or frequency of the expenditures; and</P>
              <P>(D) Does not allow the State to recoup any unspent funds allocated for these arrangements from the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Pass-through payments under MCO, PIHP, and PAHP contracts</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> States may continue to require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to make pass-through payments (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) to network providers that are hospitals, physicians, or nursing facilities under the contract, provided the requirements of this paragraph (d) are met. States may not require MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs to make pass-through payments other than those permitted under this paragraph (d).</P>
              <P>(i) In order to use a transition period described in this paragraph (d), a State must demonstrate that it had pass-through payments for hospitals, physicians, or nursing facilities in:</P>
              <P>(A) Managed care contract(s) and rate certification(s) for the rating period that includes July 5, 2016, and were submitted for CMS review and approval on or before July 5, 2016; or</P>
              <P>(B) If the managed care contract(s) and rate certification(s) for the rating period that includes July 5, 2016 had not been submitted to CMS on or before July 5, 2016, the managed care contract(s) and rate certification(s) for a rating period before July 5, 2016 that had been most recently submitted for CMS review and approval as of July 5, 2016.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The rate certification must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Base data.</E> A description of the base data used in the rate setting process (including the base data requested by the actuary, the base data that was provided by the State, and an explanation of why any base data requested was not provided by the State) and of how the actuary determined which base data set was appropriate to use for the rating period.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Trend.</E> Each trend factor, including trend factors for changes in the utilization and price of services, applied to develop the capitation rates must be adequately described with enough detail so CMS or an actuary applying generally accepted actuarial principles and practices can understand and evaluate the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The calculation of each trend used for the rating period and the reasonableness of the trend for the enrolled population.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any meaningful difference in how a trend differs between the rate cells, service categories, or eligibility categories.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Non-benefit component of the rate.</E> The development of the non-benefit component of the rate must be adequately described with enough detail so CMS or an actuary applying generally accepted actuarial principles and practices can identify each type of non-benefit expense that is included in the rate and evaluate the reasonableness of the cost assumptions underlying each expense. The actuary may document the non-benefit costs according to the types of non-benefit costs under § 438.5(e).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Adjustments.</E> All adjustments used to develop the capitation rates must be adequately described with enough detail so that CMS, or an actuary applying generally accepted actuarial principles and practices, can understand and evaluate all of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) How each material adjustment was developed and the reasonableness of the material adjustment for the enrolled population.</P>

              <P>(ii) The cost impact of each material adjustment and the aggregate cost impact of non-material adjustments.<PRTPAGE P="262"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Where in the rate setting process the adjustment was applied.</P>
              <P>(iv) A list of all non-material adjustments used in the rate development process.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Risk adjustment.</E> (i) All prospective risk adjustment methodologies must be adequately described with enough detail so that CMS or an actuary applying generally accepted actuarial principles and practices can understand and evaluate the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The data, and any adjustments to that data, to be used to calculate the adjustment.</P>
              <P>(B) The model, and any adjustments to that model, to be used to calculate the adjustment.</P>
              <P>(C) The method for calculating the relative risk factors and the reasonableness and appropriateness of the method in measuring the risk factors of the respective populations.</P>
              <P>(D) The magnitude of the adjustment on the capitation rate per MCO, PIHP, or PAHP.</P>
              <P>(E) An assessment of the predictive value of the methodology compared to prior rating periods.</P>
              <P>(F) Any concerns the actuary has with the risk adjustment process.</P>
              <P>(ii) All retrospective risk adjustment methodologies must be adequately described with enough detail so that CMS or an actuary applying generally accepted actuarial principles and practices can understand and evaluate the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The party calculating the risk adjustment.</P>
              <P>(B) The data, and any adjustments to that data, to be used to calculate the adjustment.</P>

              <P>(D) The timing and frequency of the application of the risk adjustment.</P>
              <P>(E) Any concerns the actuary has with the risk adjustment process.</P>
              <P>(iii) Application of an approved risk adjustment methodology to capitation rates does not require a revised rate certification because payment of capitation rates as modified by the approved risk adjustment methodology must be within the scope of the original rate certification. The State must provide to CMS the payment terms updated by the application of the risk adjustment methodology consistent with § 438.3(c).</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Special contract provisions.</E> A description of any of the special contract provisions related to payment in § 438.6 that are applied in the contract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rates paid under risk contracts.</E> The State, through its actuary, must certify the final capitation rate paid per rate cell under each risk contract and document the underlying data, assumptions and methodologies supporting that specific capitation rate.</P>
              <P>(1) The State may pay each MCO, PIHP or PAHP a capitation rate under the contract that is different than the capitation rate paid to another MCO, PIHP or PAHP, so long as each capitation rate per rate cell that is paid is independently developed and set in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(2) If the State determines that a retroactive adjustment to the capitation rate is necessary, the retroactive adjustment must be supported by a rationale for the adjustment and the data, assumptions and methodologies used to develop the magnitude of the adjustment must be adequately described with enough detail to allow CMS or an actuary to determine the reasonableness of the adjustment. These retroactive adjustments must be certified by an actuary in a revised rate certification and submitted as a contract amendment to be approved by CMS. All such adjustments are also subject to Federal timely claim filing requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) The State may increase or decrease the capitation rate per rate cell, as required in paragraph (c) of this section and § 438.4(b)(4), up to 1.5 percent without submitting a revised rate certification, as required under paragraph (a) of this section. Such changes of the capitation rate within the permissible 1.5 percent range must be consistent with a modification of the contract as required in § 438.3(c).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Provision of additional information.</E> The State must, upon CMS' request, provide additional information, whether part of the rate certification or additional supplemental materials, if CMS determines that information is pertinent to the approval of the certification under this part. The State must <PRTPAGE P="263"/>identify whether the information provided in addition to the rate certification is proffered by the State, the actuary, or another party.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Medical loss ratio (MLR) standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> The State must ensure, through its contracts starting on or after July 1, 2017, that each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP calculate and report a MLR in accordance with this section. For multi-year contracts that do not start in 2017, the State must require the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP to calculate and report a MLR for the rating period that begins in 2017.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section, the following terms have the indicated meanings:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Credibility adjustment</E> means an adjustment to the MLR for a partially credible MCO, PIHP, or PAHP to account for a difference between the actual and target MLRs that may be due to random statistical variation.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Full credibility</E> means a standard for which the experience of an MCO, PIHP, or PAHP is determined to be sufficient for the calculation of a MLR with a minimal chance that the difference between the actual and target medical loss ratio is not statistically significant. An MCO, PIHP, or PAHP that is assigned full credibility (or is fully credible) will not receive a credibility adjustment to its MLR.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Member months</E> mean the number of months an enrollee or a group of enrollees is covered by an MCO, PIHP, or PAHP over a specified time period, such as a year.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">MLR reporting year</E> means a period of 12 months consistent with the rating period selected by the State.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">No credibility</E> means a standard for which the experience of an MCO, PIHP, or PAHP is determined to be insufficient for the calculation of a MLR. An MCO, PIHP, or PAHP that is assigned no credibility (or is non-credible) will not be measured against any MLR requirements.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Non-claims costs</E> means those expenses for administrative services that are not: Incurred claims (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section); expenditures on activities that improve health care quality (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section); or licensing and regulatory fees, or Federal and State taxes (as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Partial credibility</E> means a standard for which the experience of an MCO, PIHP, or PAHP is determined to be sufficient for the calculation of a MLR but with a non-negligible chance that the difference between the actual and target medical loss ratios is statistically significant. An MCO, PIHP, or PAHP that is assigned partial credibility (or is partially credible) will receive a credibility adjustment to its MLR.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">MLR requirement.</E> If a State elects to mandate a minimum MLR for its MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs, that minimum MLR must be equal to or higher than 85 percent (the standard used for projecting actuarial soundness under § 438.4(b)) and the MLR must be calculated and reported for each MLR reporting year by the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP, consistent with this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculation of the MLR.</E> The MLR experienced for each MCO, PIHP, or PAHP in a MLR reporting year is the ratio of the numerator (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) to the denominator (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section). A MLR may be increased by a credibility adjustment, in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Numerator</E>—(1) <E T="03">Required elements.</E> The numerator of an MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's MLR for a MLR reporting year is the sum of the MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's incurred claims (as defined in (e)(2) of this section); the MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's expenditures for activities that improve health care quality (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section); and fraud prevention activities (as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section).</P>

              <P>(B) The highest premium tax rate in the State for which the report is being submitted, multiplied by the MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's earned premium in the State.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Denominator when MCO, PIHP, or PAHP is assumed.</E> The total amount of the denominator for a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP which is later assumed by another entity must be reported by the assuming MCO, PIHP, or PAHP for the entire MLR reporting year and no amount under this paragraph for that year may be reported by the ceding MCO, PIHP, or PAHP.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Allocation of expense</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (i) Each expense must be included under only one type of expense, unless a portion of the expense fits under the definition of, or criteria for, one type of expense and the remainder fits into a different type of expense, in which case the expense must be pro-rated between types of expenses.</P>
              <P>(ii) Expenditures that benefit multiple contracts or populations, or contracts other than those being reported, must be reported on a pro rata basis.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Methods used to allocate expenses.</E> (i) Allocation to each category must be based on a generally accepted accounting method that is expected to yield the most accurate results.</P>
              <P>(ii) Shared expenses, including expenses under the terms of a management contract, must be apportioned pro rata to the contract incurring the expense.</P>
              <P>(iii) Expenses that relate solely to the operation of a reporting entity, such as personnel costs associated with the adjusting and paying of claims, must be borne solely by the reporting entity and are not to be apportioned to the other entities.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Credibility adjustment.</E> (1) A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may add a credibility adjustment to a calculated MLR if the <PRTPAGE P="266"/>MLR reporting year experience is partially credible. The credibility adjustment is added to the reported MLR calculation before calculating any remittances, if required by the State as described in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may not add a credibility adjustment to a calculated MLR if the MLR reporting year experience is fully credible.</P>
              <P>(3) If a MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's experience is non-credible, it is presumed to meet or exceed the MLR calculation standards in this section.</P>
              <P>(4) On an annual basis, CMS will publish base credibility factors for MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs that are developed according to the following methodology:</P>
              <P>(i) CMS will use the most recently available and complete managed care encounter data or FFS claims data, and enrollment data, reported by the states to CMS. This data may cover more than 1 year of experience.</P>
              <P>(ii) CMS will calculate the credibility adjustment so that a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP receiving a capitation payment that is estimated to have a medical loss ratio of 85 percent would be expected to experience a loss ratio less than 85 percent 1 out of every 4 years, or 25 percent of the time.</P>
              <P>(iii) The minimum number of member months necessary for a MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's medical loss ratio to be determined at least partially credible will be set so that the credibility adjustment would not exceed 10 percent for any partially credible MCO, PIHP, or PAHP. Any MCO, PIHP, or PAHP with enrollment less than this number of member months will be determined non-credible.</P>
              <P>(iv) The minimum number of member months necessary for an MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's medical loss ratio to be determined fully credible will be set so that the minimum credibility adjustment for any partially credible MCO, PIHP, or PAHP would be greater than 1 percent. Any MCO, PIHP, or PAHP with enrollment greater than this number of member months will be determined to be fully credible.</P>
              <P>(v) A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP with a number of enrollee member months between the levels established for non-credible and fully credible plans will be deemed partially credible, and CMS will develop adjustments, using linear interpolation, based on the number of enrollee member months.</P>
              <P>(vi) CMS may adjust the number of enrollee member months necessary for a MCO's, PIHP's, or PAHP's experience to be non-credible, partially credible, or fully credible so that the standards are rounded for the purposes of administrative simplification. The number of member months will be rounded to 1,000 or a different degree of rounding as appropriate to ensure that the credibility thresholds are consistent with the objectives of this regulation.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Aggregation of data.</E> MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs will aggregate data for all Medicaid eligibility groups covered under the contract with the State unless the State requires separate reporting and a separate MLR calculation for specific populations.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Remittance to the State if specific MLR is not met.</E> If required by the State, a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP must provide a remittance for an MLR reporting year if the MLR for that MLR reporting year does not meet the minimum MLR standard of 85 percent or higher if set by the State as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Reporting requirements.</E> (1) The State, through its contracts, must require each MCO, PIHP, or PAHP to submit a report to the State that includes at least the following information for each MLR reporting year:</P>
              <P>(i) Total incurred claims.</P>
              <P>(ii) Expenditures on quality improving activities.</P>
              <P>(iii) Expenditures related to activities compliant with § 438.608(a)(1) through (5), (7), (8) and (b).</P>
              <P>(iv) Non-claims costs.</P>
              <P>(v) Premium revenue.</P>

              <P>(vii) Methodology(ies) for allocation of expenditures.</P>
              <P>(viii) Any credibility adjustment applied.</P>
              <P>(ix) The calculated MLR.</P>
              <P>(x) Any remittance owed to the State, if applicable.</P>

              <P>(xi) A comparison of the information reported in this paragraph with the audited financial report required under § 438.3(m).<PRTPAGE P="267"/>

                <E T="03">Indian health care provider (IHCP)</E> means a health care program operated by the Indian Health Service (IHS) or by an Indian Tribe, Tribal Organization, or Urban Indian Organization (otherwise known as an I/T/U) as those terms are defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1603).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Indian managed care entity (IMCE)</E> means a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity that is controlled (within the meaning of the last sentence of section 1903(m)(1)(C) of the Act) by the Indian Health Service, a Tribe, Tribal Organization, or Urban Indian Organization, or a consortium, which may be composed of one or more Tribes, Tribal Organizations, or Urban Indian Organizations, and which also may include the Service.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Network and coverage requirements.</E> All contracts between a State and a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, and PCCM entity, to the extent that the PCCM entity has a provider network, which enroll Indians must:</P>
              <P>(1) Require the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to demonstrate that there are sufficient IHCPs participating in the provider network of the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to ensure timely access to services available under the contract from such providers for Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services.</P>
              <P>(2) Require that IHCPs, whether participating or not, be paid for covered services provided to Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services from such providers as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) At a rate negotiated between the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity, and the IHCP, or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the absence of a negotiated rate, at a rate not less than the level and amount of payment that the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity would make for the services to a participating provider which is not an IHCP; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Make payment to all IHCPs in its network in a timely manner as required for payments to practitioners in individual or group practices under 42 CFR 447.45 and 447.46.</P>
              <P>(3) Permit any Indian who is enrolled in a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity that is not an IMCE and eligible to receive services from a IHCP primary care provider participating as a network provider, to choose that IHCP as his or her primary care provider, as long as that provider has capacity to provide the services.</P>
              <P>(4) Permit Indian enrollees to obtain services covered under the contract between the State and the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity from out-of-network IHCPs from whom the enrollee is otherwise eligible to receive such services.</P>

              <P>(5) In a State where timely access to covered services cannot be ensured due to few or no IHCPs, an MCO, PIHP, <PRTPAGE P="274"/>PAHP and PCCM entity will be considered to have met the requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if—</P>
              <P>(i) Indian enrollees are permitted by the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity to access out-of-State IHCPs; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If this circumstance is deemed to be good cause for disenrollment from both the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity and the State's managed care program in accordance with § 438.56(c).</P>
              <P>(6) MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, and PCCM entities, to the extent the PCCM entity has a provider network, must permit an out-of-network IHCP to refer an Indian enrollee to a network provider.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment requirements.</E> (1) When an IHCP is enrolled in Medicaid as a FQHC but not a participating provider of the MCO, PIHP, PAHP or PCCM entity, it must be paid an amount equal to the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity would pay a FQHC that is a network provider but is not an IHCP, including any supplemental payment from the State to make up the difference between the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP or PCCM entity pays and what the IHCP FQHC would have received under FFS.</P>

              <P>(2) When an IHCP is not enrolled in Medicaid as a FQHC, regardless of whether it participates in the network of an MCO, PIHP, PAHP and PCCM entity or not, it has the right to receive its applicable encounter rate published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by the Indian Health Service, or in the absence of a published encounter rate, the amount it would receive if the services were provided under the State plan's FFS payment methodology.</P>
              <P>(3) When the amount a IHCP receives from a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity is less than the amount required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the State must make a supplemental payment to the IHCP to make up the difference between the amount the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, or PCCM entity pays and the amount the IHCP would have received under FFS or the applicable encounter rate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Enrollment in IMCEs.</E> An IMCE may restrict its enrollment to Indians in the same manner as Indian Health Programs, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1603(12), may restrict the delivery of services to Indians, without being in violation of the requirements in § 438.3(d).</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The provider is given the opportunity to become a participating provider under the same requirements for participation in the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP network as other network providers of that type.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the provider chooses not to join the network, or does not meet the necessary qualification requirements to join, the enrollee will be transitioned to a participating provider within 60 calendar days (after being given an opportunity to select a provider who participates).</P>
              <P>(C) The only plan or provider available to the beneficiary does not, because of moral or religious objections, provide the service the enrollee seeks.</P>
              <P>(D) The beneficiary's primary care provider or other provider determines that the beneficiary needs related services that would subject the beneficiary to unnecessary risk if received separately (for example, a cesarean section and a tubal ligation) and not all of the related services are available within the network.</P>

              <P>(1) Voluntary managed care programs are those where one or more groups of beneficiaries as enumerated in section of 1905(a) of the Act have the option to either enroll in a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity, or remain enrolled in FFS to receive Medicaid covered benefits.</P>
              <P>(2) Mandatory managed care programs are those where one or more groups of beneficiaries as enumerated in section 1905(a) of the Act must enroll in a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity to receive covered Medicaid benefits.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Voluntary managed care programs.</E> (1) States that have a voluntary managed care program must have an enrollment system that:</P>
              <P>(i) Provides an enrollment choice period during which potential enrollees may make an active choice of delivery system and, if needed, choice of an MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity before enrollment is effectuated; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Employs a passive enrollment process in which the State enrolls the potential enrollee into a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity and simultaneously provides a period of time for the enrollee to make an active choice of delivery system and, if needed, to maintain enrollment in the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity passively assigned or to select a different MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity.</P>
              <P>(2) A State must provide potential enrollees the opportunity to actively elect to receive covered services through the managed care or FFS delivery system. If the potential enrollee elects to receive covered services through the managed care delivery system, the potential enrollee must then also select a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity.</P>
              <P>(i) If the State does not use a passive enrollment process and the potential enrollee does not make an active choice during the period allowed by the state, then the potential enrollee will continue to receive covered services through the FFS delivery system.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the State uses a passive enrollment process, the potential enrollee must select either to accept the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity selected for them by the State's passive enrollment process, select a different MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity, or elect to receive covered services through the FFS delivery system. If the potential enrollee does not make an active choice during the time allowed by the state, the potential enrollee will remain enrolled with the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity selected by the passive enrollment process.</P>
              <P>(3) The State must provide informational notices to each potential enrollee at the time the potential enrollee first becomes eligible to enroll in a managed care program and within a timeframe that enables the potential enrollee to use the information in choosing among available delivery system and/or managed care plan options. The notices must:</P>
              <P>(i) Clearly explain (as relevant to the State's managed care program) the implications to the potential enrollee of: not making an active choice between managed care and FFS; selecting a different MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity; and accepting the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity selected by the State;</P>

              <P>(ii) Identify the MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, PCCMs or PCCM entities available to the potential enrollee should they elect the managed care delivery system;<PRTPAGE P="277"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Provide clear instructions for how to make known to the State the enrollee's selection of the FFS delivery system or a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity;</P>
              <P>(iv) Provide a comprehensive explanation of the length of the enrollment period, the 90 day without cause disenrollment period, and all other disenrollment options as specified in § 438.56;</P>
              <P>(v) Include the contact information for the beneficiary support system in § 438.71; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Comply with the information requirements in § 438.10.</P>
              <P>(4) The State's enrollment system must provide that beneficiaries already enrolled in an MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity are given priority to continue that enrollment if the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity does not have the capacity to accept all those seeking enrollment under the program.</P>
              <P>(5) If a State elects to use a passive enrollment process, the process must assign beneficiaries to a qualified MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity. To be a qualified MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity, it must:</P>
              <P>(i) Not be subject to the intermediate sanction described in § 438.702(a)(4); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Have capacity to enroll beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(6) A passive enrollment process must seek to preserve existing provider-beneficiary relationships and relationships with providers that have traditionally served Medicaid beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(i) An “existing provider-beneficiary relationship” is one in which the provider was a main source of Medicaid services for the beneficiary during the previous year. This may be established through State records of previous managed care enrollment or FFS experience, encounter data, or through contact with the beneficiary.</P>
              <P>(ii) A provider is considered to have “traditionally served” Medicaid beneficiaries if it has experience in serving the Medicaid population.</P>
              <P>(7) If the approach in paragraph (c)(6) of this section is not possible, the State must distribute the beneficiaries equitably among the MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, PCCMs and PCCM entities.</P>
              <P>(i) The State may not arbitrarily exclude any MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity from being considered.</P>
              <P>(ii) The State may consider additional criteria to conduct the passive enrollment process, including the enrollment preferences of family members, previous plan assignment of the beneficiary, quality assurance and improvement performance, procurement evaluation elements, accessibility of provider offices for people with disabilities (when appropriate), and other reasonable criteria that support the objectives of the managed care program.</P>
              <P>(8) If a passive enrollment process is used and the enrollee does not elect to be enrolled into the FFS delivery system, the State must send a notice to the enrollee:</P>
              <P>(i) Confirming that the enrollee's time to elect to enroll in the FFS delivery system has ended and that the enrollee will remain enrolled in the managed care delivery system for the remainder of the enrollment period unless one of the disenrollment reasons specified in § 438.56 applies.</P>
              <P>(ii) Clearly and fully explaining the enrollee's right, and process to follow, to disenroll from the passively assigned MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity and select a different MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity within 90 days from the effective date of the enrollment or for any reason specified in § 438.56(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(iii) Within 5 calendar days of the end of the time allowed for making the delivery system selection.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Mandatory managed care programs.</E> (1) States must have an enrollment system for a mandatory managed care program that includes the elements specified in paragraphs (d)(2) through (8) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The State's enrollment system must implement enrollment in a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) If the State does not use a passive enrollment process and the potential enrollee does not make an active choice of a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity during the period allowed by the State, the potential enrollee will be enrolled into a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity selected by the State's default process.<PRTPAGE P="278"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) If the State uses a passive enrollment process, the potential enrollee must either accept the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity selected by the State's passive enrollment process or select a different MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity. If the potential enrollee does not make an active choice during the time allowed by the State, the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity selected by the passive enrollment process will remain effective.</P>
              <P>(3) A State must provide informational notices to each potential enrollee at the time the potential enrollee first becomes eligible to enroll in a managed care program and within a timeframe that enables the potential enrollee to use the information in choosing among available managed care plans. The notices must:</P>
              <P>(i) Include the MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, PCCMs, or PCCM entities available to the potential enrollee;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide clear instructions for how to make known to the State the enrollee's selection of a MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity;</P>
              <P>(iii) Clearly explain the implications to the potential enrollee of not making an active choice of an MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity as well as the implications of making an active choice of an MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity;</P>
              <P>(iv) Provide a comprehensive explanation of the length of the enrollment period, the 90 day without cause disenrollment period, and all other disenrollment options as specified in § 438.56;</P>
              <P>(v) Include the contact information for the beneficiary support system in § 438.71; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Comply with the information requirements in § 438.10.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Priority for enrollment.</E> The State's enrollment system must provide that beneficiaries already enrolled in an MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity are given priority to continue that enrollment if the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity does not have the capacity to accept all those seeking enrollment under the program.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Enrollment by default.</E> For potential enrollees that do not select an MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entities during the period allowed by the state, the State must have a default enrollment process for assigning those beneficiaries to qualified MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, PCCMs and PCCM entities. To be a qualified MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity, it must:</P>
              <P>(i) Not be subject to the intermediate sanction described in § 438.702(a)(4); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Have capacity to enroll beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Passive enrollment.</E> For States that use a passive enrollment process, the process must assign potential enrollees to qualified MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, PCCMs and PCCM entities. To be a qualified MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity, it must:</P>
              <P>(i) Not be subject to the intermediate sanction described in § 438.702(a)(4); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Have capacity to enroll beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(7) The passive and default enrollment processes must seek to preserve existing provider-beneficiary relationships and relationships with providers that have traditionally served Medicaid beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(i) An “existing provider-beneficiary relationship” is one in which the provider was a main source of Medicaid services for the beneficiary during the previous year. This may be established through State records of previous managed care enrollment or FFS experience, encounter data, or through contact with the beneficiary.</P>
              <P>(ii) A provider is considered to have “traditionally served” Medicaid beneficiaries if it has experience in serving the Medicaid population.</P>
              <P>(8) If the approach in paragraph (d)(7) of this section is not possible, the State must distribute the beneficiaries equitably among the MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, PCCMs and PCCM entities available to enroll them.</P>
              <P>(i) The State may not arbitrarily exclude any MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity from being considered; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The State may consider additional criteria to conduct the default enrollment process, including the enrollment preferences of family members, previous plan assignment of the beneficiary, quality assurance and improvement performance, procurement evaluation elements, accessibility of <PRTPAGE P="279"/>provider offices for people with disabilities (when appropriate), and other reasonable criteria related to a beneficiary's experience with the Medicaid program.</P>

              <P>(1) Specify the reasons for which the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity may request disenrollment of an enrollee.</P>
              <P>(2) Provide that the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity may not request disenrollment because of an adverse change in the enrollee's health status, or because of the enrollee's utilization of medical services, diminished mental capacity, or uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from his or her special needs (except when his or her continued enrollment in the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM or PCCM entity seriously impairs the entity's ability to furnish services to either this particular enrollee or other enrollees).</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the methods by which the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity assures the agency that it does not request disenrollment for reasons other than those permitted under the contract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Disenrollment requested by the enrollee.</E> If the State chooses to limit disenrollment, its MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, and PCCM entity contracts must provide that a beneficiary may request disenrollment as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For cause, at any time.</P>
              <P>(2) Without cause, at the following times:</P>
              <P>(i) During the 90 days following the date of the beneficiary's initial enrollment into the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity, or during the 90 days following the date the State sends the beneficiary notice of that enrollment, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(ii) At least once every 12 months thereafter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Upon automatic reenrollment under paragraph (g) of this section, if the temporary loss of Medicaid eligibility has caused the beneficiary to miss the annual disenrollment opportunity.</P>
              <P>(iv) When the State imposes the intermediate sanction specified in § 438.702(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures for disenrollment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Request for disenrollment.</E> The beneficiary (or his or her representative) must submit an oral or written request, as required by the State—</P>
              <P>(i) To the State (or its agent); or</P>
              <P>(ii) To the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity, if the State permits MCOs, PIHP, PAHPs, PCCMs, and PCCM entities to process disenrollment requests.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Cause for disenrollment.</E> The following are cause for disenrollment:</P>
              <P>(i) The enrollee moves out of the MCO's, PIHP's, PAHP's, PCCM's, or PCCM entity's service area.</P>
              <P>(ii) The plan does not, because of moral or religious objections, cover the service the enrollee seeks.</P>
              <P>(iii) The enrollee needs related services (for example, a cesarean section and a tubal ligation) to be performed at the same time; not all related services are available within the provider network; and the enrollee's primary care provider or another provider determines that receiving the services separately would subject the enrollee to unnecessary risk.</P>
              <P>(iv) For enrollees that use MLTSS, the enrollee would have to change their residential, institutional, or employment supports provider based on that provider's change in status from an in-network to an out-of-network provider with the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP and, as a result, would experience a disruption in their residence or employment.</P>
              <P>(v) Other reasons, including poor quality of care, lack of access to services covered under the contract, or lack of access to providers experienced in dealing with the enrollee's care needs.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity action on request.</E> (i) When the MCO's, PIHP's, PAHP's, PCCM's, or PCCM entity's contract with the State <PRTPAGE P="280"/>permits the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity to process disenrollment requests, the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity may either approve a request for disenrollment by or on behalf of an enrollee or the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity must refer the request to the State.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, PCCM entity, or State agency (whichever is responsible) fails to make a disenrollment determination so that the beneficiary can be disenrolled within the timeframes specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the disenrollment is considered approved.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">State agency action on request.</E> For a request received directly from the beneficiary, or one referred by the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity, the State agency must take action to approve or disapprove the request based on the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Reasons cited in the request.</P>
              <P>(ii) Information provided by the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity at the agency's request.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any of the reasons specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Use of the MCO's, PIHP's, PAHP's, PCCM's, or PCCMs entity's grievance procedures.</E> (i) The State agency may require that the enrollee seek redress through the MCO's, PIHP's, PAHP's, PCCM's, or PCCM entity's grievance system before making a determination on the enrollee's request.</P>
              <P>(ii) The grievance process, if used, must be completed in time to permit the disenrollment (if approved) to be effective in accordance with the timeframe specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If, as a result of the grievance process, the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity approves the disenrollment, the State agency is not required to make a determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Timeframe for disenrollment determinations.</E> (1) Regardless of the procedures followed, the effective date of an approved disenrollment must be no later than the first day of the second month following the month in which the enrollee requests disenrollment or the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity refers the request to the State.</P>
              <P>(2) If the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, PCCM entity, or the State agency (whichever is responsible) fails to make the determination within the timeframes specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the disenrollment is considered approved for the effective date that would have been established had the State or MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, PCCM entity complied with paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice and appeals.</E> A State that restricts disenrollment under this section must take the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Provide that enrollees and their representatives are given written notice of disenrollment rights at least 60 days before the start of each enrollment period. The notice must include an explanation of all of the enrollee's disenrollment rights as specified in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Ensure timely access to State fair hearing for any enrollee dissatisfied with a State agency determination that there is not good cause for disenrollment.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Automatic reenrollment: Contract requirement.</E> If the State plan so specifies, the contract must provide for automatic reenrollment of a beneficiary who is disenrolled solely because he or she loses Medicaid eligibility for a period of 2 months or less.</P>

              <P>(i) The enrollee has access to services consistent with the access they previously had, and is permitted to retain their current provider for a period of time if that provider is not in the MCO, PIHP or PAHP network.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Basis for imposition of sanctions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each State that contracts with an MCO must, and each State that contracts with a PCCM or PCCM entity may, establish intermediate sanctions (which may include those specified in § 438.702) that it may impose if it makes any of the determinations specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. The State may base its determinations on findings from onsite surveys, enrollee or other complaints, financial status, or any other source.</P>
              <P>(b) A State determines that an MCO acts or fails to act as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Fails substantially to provide medically necessary services that the MCO is required to provide, under law or under its contract with the State, to an enrollee covered under the contract.</P>
              <P>(2) Imposes on enrollees premiums or charges that are in excess of the premiums or charges permitted under the Medicaid program.</P>
              <P>(3) Acts to discriminate among enrollees on the basis of their health status or need for health care services. This includes termination of enrollment or refusal to reenroll a beneficiary, except as permitted under the Medicaid program, or any practice that would reasonably be expected to discourage enrollment by beneficiaries whose medical condition or history indicates probable need for substantial future medical services.</P>
              <P>(4) Misrepresents or falsifies information that it furnishes to CMS or to the State.</P>
              <P>(5) Misrepresents or falsifies information that it furnishes to an enrollee, potential enrollee, or health care provider.</P>
              <P>(6) Fails to comply with the requirements for physician incentive plans, as set forth (for Medicare) in §§ 422.208 and 422.210 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(c) A State determines that an MCO, PCCM or PCCM entity has distributed <PRTPAGE P="319"/>directly, or indirectly through any agent or independent contractor, marketing materials that have not been approved by the State or that contain false or materially misleading information.</P>
              <P>(d) A State determines that—</P>
              <P>(1) An MCO has violated any of the other requirements of sections 1903(m) or 1932 of the Act, or any implementing regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) A PCCM or PCCM entity has violated any of the other applicable requirements of sections 1932 or 1905(t)(3) of the Act, or any implementing regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) For any of the violations under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, only the sanctions specified in § 438.702(a)(3), (4), and (5) may be imposed.</P>

              <P>(a) The types of intermediate sanctions that a State may impose under this subpart include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Civil money penalties in the amounts specified in § 438.704.</P>
              <P>(2) Appointment of temporary management for an MCO as provided in § 438.706.</P>
              <P>(3) Granting enrollees the right to terminate enrollment without cause and notifying the affected enrollees of their right to disenroll.</P>
              <P>(4) Suspension of all new enrollment, including default enrollment, after the date the Secretary or the State notifies the MCO of a determination of a violation of any requirement under sections 1903(m) or 1932 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(5) Suspension of payment for beneficiaries enrolled after the effective date of the sanction and until CMS or the State is satisfied that the reason for imposition of the sanction no longer exists and is not likely to recur.</P>
              <P>(b) State agencies retain authority to impose additional sanctions under State statutes or State regulations that address areas of noncompliance specified in § 438.700, as well as additional areas of noncompliance. Nothing in this subpart prevents State agencies from exercising that authority.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> If the State imposes civil monetary penalties as provided under § 438.702(a)(1), the maximum civil money penalty the State may impose varies depending on the nature of the MCO's, PCCM or PCCM entity's action or failure to act, as provided in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific limits.</E> (1) The limit is $25,000 for each determination under § 438.700(b)(1), (5), (6), and (c).</P>
              <P>(2) The limit is $100,000 for each determination under § 438.700(b)(3) or (4).</P>
              <P>(3) The limit is $15,000 for each beneficiary the State determines was not enrolled because of a discriminatory practice under § 438.700(b)(3). (This is subject to the overall limit of $100,000 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Specific amount.</E> For premiums or charges in excess of the amounts permitted under the Medicaid program, the maximum amount of the penalty is $25,000 or double the amount of the excess charges, whichever is greater. The State must deduct from the penalty the amount of overcharge and return it to the affected enrollees.</P>

              <P>(1) There is continued egregious behavior by the MCO, including but not limited to behavior that is described in § 438.700, or that is contrary to any requirements of sections 1903(m) and 1932 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) There is substantial risk to enrollees' health.</P>
              <P>(3) The sanction is necessary to ensure the health of the MCO's enrollees—</P>
              <P>(i) While improvements are made to remedy violations under § 438.700.</P>
              <P>(ii) Until there is an orderly termination or reorganization of the MCO.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Required imposition of sanction.</E> The State must impose temporary management (regardless of any other sanction that may be imposed) if it <PRTPAGE P="320"/>finds that an MCO has repeatedly failed to meet substantive requirements in sections 1903(m) or 1932 of the Act, or this subpart. The State must also grant enrollees the right to terminate enrollment without cause, as described in § 438.702(a)(3), and must notify the affected enrollees of their right to terminate enrollment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Hearing.</E> The State may not delay imposition of temporary management to provide a hearing before imposing this sanction.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for sanction.</E> A State may recommend that CMS impose the denial of payment sanction specified in <PRTPAGE P="321"/>paragraph (e) of this section on an MCO with a contract under this part if the agency determines that the MCO acts or fails to act as specified in § 438.700(b)(1) through (6).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of an agency determination.</E> (1) The State's determination becomes CMS' determination for purposes of section 1903(m)(5)(A) of the Act unless CMS reverses or modifies it within 15 days.</P>
              <P>(2) When the State decides to recommend imposing the sanction described in paragraph (e) of this section, this recommendation becomes CMS' decision, for purposes of section 1903(m)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act, unless CMS rejects this recommendation within 15 days.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of sanction.</E> If the State's determination becomes CMS' determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State takes all of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Gives the MCO written notice of the nature and basis of the proposed sanction.</P>
              <P>(2) Allows the MCO 15 days from the date it receives the notice to provide evidence that it has not acted or failed to act in the manner that is the basis for the recommended sanction.</P>
              <P>(3) May extend the initial 15-day period for an additional 15 days if—</P>
              <P>(i) The MCO submits a written request that includes a credible explanation of why it needs additional time.</P>
              <P>(ii) The request is received by CMS before the end of the initial period.</P>
              <P>(iii) CMS has not determined that the MCO's conduct poses a threat to an enrollee's health or safety.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Informal reconsideration.</E> (1) If the MCO submits a timely response to the notice of sanction, the State—</P>
              <P>(i) Conducts an informal reconsideration that includes review of the evidence by a State agency official who did not participate in the original recommendation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Gives the MCO a concise written decision setting forth the factual and legal basis for the decision.</P>
              <P>(iii) Forwards the decision to CMS.</P>
              <P>(2) The State's decision under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section becomes CMS' decision unless CMS reverses or modifies the decision within 15 days from date of receipt by CMS.</P>
              <P>(3) If CMS reverses or modifies the State decision, the agency sends the MCO a copy of CMS' decision.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Denial of payment.</E> (1) CMS, based upon the recommendation of the agency, may deny payment to the State for new enrollees of the MCO under section 1903(m)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act in the following situations:</P>
              <P>(i) If a CMS determination that an MCO has acted or failed to act, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of § 438.700, is affirmed on review under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the CMS determination is not timely contested by the MCO under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Under § 438.726(b), CMS' denial of payment for new enrollees automatically results in a denial of agency payments to the MCO for the same enrollees. (A new enrollee is an enrollee that applies for enrollment after the effective date in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Effective date of sanction.</E> (1) If the MCO does not seek reconsideration, a sanction is effective 15 days after the date the MCO is notified under paragraph (c) of this section of the decision to impose the sanction.</P>
              <P>(2) If the MCO seeks reconsideration, the following rules apply:</P>
              <P>(i) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the sanction is effective on the date specified in CMS' reconsideration notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) If CMS, in consultation with the State, determines that the MCO's conduct poses a serious threat to an enrollee's health or safety, the sanction may be made effective earlier than the date of the agency's reconsideration decision under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">CMS' role.</E> (1) CMS retains the right to independently perform the functions assigned to the State under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) At the same time that the State sends notice to the MCO under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, CMS forwards a copy of the notice to the OIG.</P>

              <P>(3) CMS conveys the determination described in paragraph (b) of this section to the OIG for consideration of possible imposition of civil money penalties under section 1903(m)(5)(A) of the <PRTPAGE P="322"/>Act and part 1003 of this title. In accordance with the provisions of part 1003, the OIG may impose civil money penalties on the MCO in addition to, or in place of, the sanctions that may be imposed under this section.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Aggregate lifetime dollar limit</E> means a dollar limitation on the total amount of specified benefits that may be paid under a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Annual dollar limit</E> means a dollar limitation on the total amount of specified benefits that may be paid in a 12-month period under a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Cumulative financial requirements</E> are financial requirements that determine whether or to what extent benefits are provided based on accumulated amounts and include deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. (However, cumulative financial requirements do not include aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits because these two terms are excluded from the meaning of financial requirements.)</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefits</E> are benefits defined in section 1905(r) of the Act.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Financial requirements</E> include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or out-of-pocket maximums. Financial requirements do not include aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Medical/surgical benefits</E> means benefits for items or services for medical conditions or surgical procedures, as defined by the State and in accordance with applicable Federal and State law, but do not include mental health or substance use disorder benefits. Any condition defined by the State as being or as not being a medical/surgical condition must be defined to be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice (for example, the most current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or State guidelines). Medical/surgical benefits include long term care services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Mental health benefits</E> means benefits for items or services for mental health conditions, as defined by the State and in accordance with applicable Federal and State law. Any condition defined by the State as being or as not being a mental health condition must be defined to be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice (for example, the most current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the most current version of the ICD, or State guidelines). Mental health benefits include long term care services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Substance use disorder benefits</E> means benefits for items or services for substance use disorders, as defined by the State and in accordance with applicable Federal and State law. Any disorder defined by the State as being or as not being a substance use disorder must be defined to be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice (for example, the most current version of the DSM, the most current version of the ICD, or State guidelines). Substance use disorder benefits include long term care services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Treatment limitations</E> include limits on benefits based on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, days in a waiting period, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of treatment. Treatment limitations include both quantitative treatment limitations, which are expressed numerically (such as 50 outpatient visits per year), and nonquantitative treatment limitations, which otherwise limit the scope or duration of benefits for treatment under a plan or coverage. (<E T="03">See</E> § 438.910(d)(2) for an illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.) A permanent exclusion of all benefits for a particular condition or disorder, however, is not a treatment <PRTPAGE P="325"/>limitation for purposes of this definition.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Parity requirements for aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General parity requirement.</E> Each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP providing services to MCO enrollees must comply with paragraphs (b), (c), or (e) of this section for all enrollees of a MCO in States that cover both medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits under the State plan. This section details the application of the parity requirements for aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs with no limit or limits on less than one-third of all medical/surgical benefits.</E> If a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP does not include an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on any medical/surgical benefits or includes an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit that applies to less than one-third of all medical/surgical benefits provided to enrollees through a contract with the State, it may not impose an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, respectively, on mental health or substance use disorder benefits.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs with a limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.</E> If a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP includes an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits provided to enrollees through a contract with the State, it must either—</P>
              <P>(1) Apply the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit both to the medical/surgical benefits to which the limit would otherwise apply and to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a manner that does not distinguish between the medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits; or</P>
              <P>(2) Not include an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is more restrictive than the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, respectively, on medical/surgical benefits.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determining one-third and two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.</E> For purposes of this section, the determination of whether the portion of medical/surgical benefits subject to an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit represents one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits is based on the total dollar amount of all combinations of MCO, PIHP, and PAHP payments for medical/surgical benefits expected to be paid under the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP for a contract year (or for the portion of a contract year after a change in benefits that affects the applicability of the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits). Any reasonable method may be used to determine whether the dollar amount expected to be paid under the MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs will constitute one-third or two-thirds of the dollar amount of all payments for medical/surgical benefits.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">MCO, PIHP, or PAHP not described in this section</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP that is not described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section for aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits on medical/surgical benefits, must either—</P>
              <P>(i) Impose no aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, on mental health or substance use disorder benefits; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Impose an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is no more restrictive than an average limit calculated for medical/surgical benefits in the following manner. The average limit is calculated by taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits, as appropriate, that are applicable to the categories of medical/surgical benefits. Limits based on delivery mechanisms, such as inpatient/outpatient treatment or normal treatment of common, low-cost conditions (such as treatment of normal births), do not constitute categories for purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii). In addition, for purposes of determining weighted averages, any benefits that are not within a category that is subject to a separately-designated dollar limit under the contract are taken into account as a single separate category by using an estimate of the upper limit on the dollar amount that a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may reasonably be expected to incur for such benefits, taking into <PRTPAGE P="326"/>account any other applicable restrictions.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Weighting.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (e), the weighting applicable to any category of medical/surgical benefits is determined in the manner set forth in paragraph (d) of this section for determining one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Clarification of terms</E>—(1) <E T="03">Classification of benefits.</E> When reference is made in this section to a classification of benefits, the term “classification” means a classification as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</E> When reference is made in this section to a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, the reference to type means its nature. Different types of financial requirements include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums. Different types of quantitative treatment limitations include annual, episode, and lifetime day and visit limits. <E T="03">See</E> paragraph (d)(2) of this section for an illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Level of a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</E> When reference is made in this section to a level of a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, level refers to the magnitude of the type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General parity requirement</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule and scope.</E> Each MCO, PIHP and PAHP providing services to MCO enrollees in a State that covers both medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits under the State plan, must not apply any financial requirement or treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation of that type applied to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the same classification furnished to enrollees (whether or not the benefits are furnished by the same MCO, PIHP, or PAHP). Whether a financial requirement or treatment limitation is a predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification is determined separately for each type of financial requirement or treatment limitation. The application of the rules of this paragraph (b) to financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (c) of this section; the application of the rules of this paragraph (b) to nonquantitative treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Classifications of benefits used for applying rules.</E> If an MCO enrollee is provided mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification of benefits described in this paragraph (b)(2), mental health or substance use disorder benefits must be provided to the enrollee in every classification in which medical/surgical benefits are provided. In determining the classification in which a particular benefit belongs, a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP must apply the same reasonable standards to medical/surgical benefits and to mental health or substance use disorder benefits. To the extent that a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP provides benefits in a classification and imposes any separate financial requirement or treatment limitation (or separate level of a financial requirement or treatment limitation) for benefits in the classification, the rules of this section apply separately for that classification for all financial requirements or treatment limitations. The following classifications of benefits are the only classifications used in applying the rules of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Inpatient.</E> Benefits furnished on an inpatient basis.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Outpatient.</E> Benefits furnished on an outpatient basis. <E T="03">See</E> special rules for office visits in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Emergency care.</E> Benefits for emergency care.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Prescription drugs.</E> Benefits for prescription drugs. <E T="03">See</E> special rules for multi-tiered prescription drug benefits in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="327"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations</E>—(1) <E T="03">Determining “substantially all” and “predominant”</E>—(i) <E T="03">Substantially all.</E> For purposes of this section, a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation is considered to apply to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification of benefits if it applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in that classification. If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation does not apply to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, then that type cannot be applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in that classification.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Predominant.</E> (A) If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification as determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the level of the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that is considered the predominant level of that type in a classification of benefits is the level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in that classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation.</P>
              <P>(B) If, for a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, there is no single level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in the classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation, the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may combine levels until the combination of levels applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation in the classification. The least restrictive level within the combination is considered the predominant level of that type in the classification. (For this purpose, a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may combine the most restrictive levels first, with each less restrictive level added to the combination until the combination applies to more than one-half of the benefits subject to the financial requirement or treatment limitation.)</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Portion based on MCO, PIHP or PAHP payments.</E> For purposes of this section, the determination of the portion of medical/surgical benefits in a classification of benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation) is based on the total dollar amount of all combinations of MCO, PIHP, and PAHP payments for medical/surgical benefits in the classification expected to be paid under the MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs for a contract year (or for the portion of a contract year after a change in benefits that affects the applicability of the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Clarifications for certain threshold requirements.</E> For any deductible, the dollar amount of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP payments includes all payments for claims that would be subject to the deductible if it had not been satisfied. For any out-of-pocket maximum, the dollar amount of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP payments includes all payments associated with out-of-pocket payments that are taken into account towards the out-of-pocket maximum as well as all payments associated with out-of-pocket payments that would have been made towards the out-of-pocket maximum if it had not been satisfied. Similar rules apply for any other thresholds at which the rate of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP payment changes.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Determining the dollar amount of MCO, PIHP, or PAHP payments.</E> Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, any reasonable method may be used to determine the dollar amount expected to be paid under a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP for medical/surgical benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special rules</E>—(i)<E T="03"> Multi-tiered prescription drug benefits.</E> If a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP applies different levels of financial requirements to different tiers of prescription drug benefits based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the rules in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="328"/>(d)(1) of this section (relating to requirements for nonquantitative treatment limitations) and without regard to whether a drug is generally prescribed for medical/surgical benefits or for mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP satisfies the parity requirements of this section for prescription drug benefits. Reasonable factors include cost, efficacy, generic versus brand name, and mail order versus pharmacy pick-up/delivery.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sub-classifications permitted for office visits, separate from other outpatient services.</E> For purposes of applying the financial requirement and treatment limitation rules of this section, a MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may divide its benefits furnished on an outpatient basis into the two sub-classifications described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii). After the sub-classifications are established, the MCO, PIHP or PAHP may not impose any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any sub-classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the sub-classification using the methodology set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Sub-classifications other than these special rules, such as separate sub-classifications for generalists and specialists, are not permitted. The two sub-classifications permitted under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) are:</P>
              <P>(A) Office visits (such as physician visits); and</P>
              <P>(B) All other outpatient items and services (such as outpatient surgery, facility charges for day treatment centers, laboratory charges, or other medical items).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">No separate cumulative financial requirements.</E> A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may not apply any cumulative financial requirement for mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a classification that accumulates separately from any established for medical/surgical benefits in the same classification.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Compliance with other cost-sharing rules.</E> Each MCO, PIHP, and PAHP must meet the cost-sharing requirements in § 438.108 when applying Medicaid cost-sharing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Nonquantitative treatment limitations</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A MCO, PIHP, or PAHP may not impose a nonquantitative treatment limitation for mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification unless, under the policies and procedures of the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP as written and in operation, any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in the classification are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the limitation for medical/surgical benefits in the classification.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A State plan that offers exempt individuals as defined in § 440.315 the option to enroll in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage must identify in its State plan the exempt groups for which this coverage is available, and must comply with the following provisions:</P>

              <P>(1) In any case in which the State offers an exempt individual the option to obtain coverage in a benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit package, the State must effectively inform the individual prior to enrollment that the enrollment is voluntary and that the individual may disenroll from the benchmark or benchmark-equivalent <PRTPAGE P="354"/>coverage at any time and regain immediate access to standard full Medicaid coverage under the State plan.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to any enrollment in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage, the State must inform the exempt individual of the benefits available under the benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit package and the costs under such a package and provide a comparison of how they differ from the benefits and costs available under the standard full Medicaid program. The State must also inform exempt individuals that they may disenroll at any time and provide them with information about the process for disenrolling.</P>
              <P>(3) The State must document in the exempt individual's eligibility file that the individual was informed in accordance with this section prior to enrollment, was given ample time to arrive at an informed choice, and voluntarily and affirmatively chose to enroll in the benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit package.</P>
              <P>(4) For individuals who the State determines have become exempt individuals while enrolled in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage, the State must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section above within 30 days after such determination.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disenrollment Process.</E> (1) The State must act upon requests promptly for exempt individuals who choose to disenroll from benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage.</P>

              <P>(1) States wishing to elect Secretary-approved coverage should submit a full description of the proposed coverage (including a benefit-by-benefit comparison of the proposed plan to one or more of the three other benchmark plans specified above or to the State's standard full Medicaid coverage package), and of the population to which coverage will be offered. In addition, <PRTPAGE P="355"/>the State should submit any other information that will be relevant to a determination that the proposed health benefits coverage will be appropriate for the proposed population.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Meaning of terms.</E> For purposes of this section, except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following terms have the meanings indicated:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Aggregate lifetime dollar limit</E> means a dollar limitation on the total amount of specified benefits that may be paid under an ABP.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs)</E> mean benefit packages in one or more of the benchmark coverage packages described in §§ 440.330(a) through (c) and 440.335. Benefits may be delivered through managed care and non-managed care delivery systems. Consistent with the requirements of § 440.385, States must comply with the managed care provisions at section 1932 of the Act and part 438 of this chapter, if benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefits are provided through a managed care entity.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Annual dollar limit</E> means a dollar limitation on the total amount of specified benefits that may be paid in a 12-month period under an ABP.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Cumulative financial requirements</E> are financial requirements that determine whether or to what extent benefits are provided based on accumulated amounts and include deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. (However, cumulative financial requirements do not include aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits because these two terms are excluded from the meaning of financial requirements.)</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">EPSDT</E> means benefits defined in section 1905(r) of the Act.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Financial requirements</E> include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or out-of-pocket maximums. Financial requirements do not include aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Medical/surgical benefits</E> means benefits for items or services for medical conditions or surgical procedures, as defined by the State under the terms of the ABP and in accordance with applicable Federal and State law, but does not include mental health or substance use disorder benefits. Any condition defined by the state as being or as not being a medical/surgical condition must be defined to be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice (for example, the most current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or State guidelines). Medical/surgical benefits include long term services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Mental health benefits</E> means benefits for items or services for mental health conditions, as defined by the State <PRTPAGE P="359"/>under the terms of the ABP and in accordance with applicable Federal and State law. Any condition defined by the State as being or as not being a mental health condition must be defined to be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice (for example, the most current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the most current version of the ICD, or State guidelines. Mental health benefits include long term care services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Substance use disorder benefits</E> means benefits for items or services for substance use disorder, as defined by the State under the terms of the ABP and in accordance with applicable Federal and State law. Any disorder defined by the State as being or as not being a substance use disorder must be defined to be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice (for example, the most current version of the DSM, the most current version of the ICD, or State guidelines). Substance use disorder benefits include long term care services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Treatment limitations</E> include limits on benefits based on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, days in a waiting period, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of treatment. Treatment limitations include both quantitative treatment limitations, which are expressed numerically (such as 50 outpatient visits per year), and nonquantitative treatment limitations, which otherwise limit the scope or duration of benefits for treatment under an ABP. (<E T="03">See</E> paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section for an illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.) A permanent exclusion of all benefits for a particular condition or disorder, however, is not a treatment limitation for purposes of this definition.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations</E>—(1) <E T="03">Clarification of terms</E>—(i) <E T="03">Classification of benefits.</E> When reference is made in this paragraph (b) to a classification of benefits, the term “classification” means a classification as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</E> When reference is made in this paragraph (b) to a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, the reference to type means its nature. Different types of financial requirements include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums. Different types of quantitative treatment limitations include annual, episode, and lifetime day and visit limits. <E T="03">See</E> paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section for an illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Level of a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</E> When reference is made in this paragraph (b) to a level of a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, level refers to the magnitude of the type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">General parity requirement</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A State may not apply within an ABP any financial requirement or treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation of that type applied to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the same classification. Whether a financial requirement or treatment limitation is a predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification is determined separately for each type of financial requirement or treatment limitation. The application of the rules of this paragraph (b)(2) to financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; the application of the rules of this paragraph (b)(2) to nonquantitative treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Classifications of benefits used for applying rules.</E> ABPs must include mental health or substance use disorder benefits in every classification of benefits described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) in which medical/surgical benefits are provided. In determining the classification in which a particular benefit belongs, the State must apply <PRTPAGE P="360"/>the same reasonable standards to medical/surgical benefits and to mental health or substance use disorder benefits. To the extent that a State provides ABP benefits in a classification and imposes any separate financial requirement or treatment limitation (or separate level of a financial requirement or treatment limitation) for benefits in the classification, the rules of this paragraph (b) apply separately for that classification for all financial requirements or treatment limitations. The following classifications of benefits are the only classifications used in applying the rules of this paragraph (b):</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Inpatient.</E> Benefits furnished on an inpatient basis.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Outpatient.</E> Benefits furnished on an outpatient basis. See special rules for office visits in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Emergency care.</E> Benefits for emergency care.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Prescription drugs.</E> Benefits for prescription drugs. See special rules for multi-tiered prescription drug benefits in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations</E>—(i) <E T="03">Determining “substantially all” and “predominant”</E>—(A) <E T="03">Substantially all.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (b), a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation is considered to apply to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification of benefits if it applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in that classification. If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation does not apply to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, then that type cannot be applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in that classification.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Predominant</E>—(<E T="03">1</E>) If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the level of the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that is considered the predominant level of that type in a classification of benefits is the level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in that classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If, for a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, there is no single level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in the classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation, the State may combine levels until the combination of levels applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation in the classification. The least restrictive level within the combination is considered the predominant level of that type in the classification. (For this purpose, a State may combine the most restrictive levels first, with each less restrictive level added to the combination until the combination applies to more than one-half of the benefits subject to the financial requirement or treatment limitation.)</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Portion based on ABP payments.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (b), the determination of the portion of medical/surgical benefits in a classification of benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation) is based on the dollar amount of all ABP payments for medical/surgical benefits in the classification expected to be paid under the ABP for the plan year (or for the portion of the plan year after a change in ABP benefits that affects the applicability of the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Clarifications for certain threshold requirements.</E> For any deductible, the dollar amount of ABP payments includes all payments for claims that would be subject to the deductible if it had not been satisfied. For any out-of-pocket maximum, the dollar amount of ABP payments includes all payments associated with out-of-pocket payments that are taken into account towards the out-of-pocket maximum as well as all payments associated with <PRTPAGE P="361"/>out-of-pocket payments that would have been made towards the out-of-pocket maximum if it had not been satisfied. Similar rules apply for any other thresholds at which the rate of payment changes.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Determining the dollar amount of ABP payments.</E> Subject to paragraph (b)(3)(i)(D) of this section, any reasonable method may be used to determine the dollar amount expected to be paid for medical/surgical benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Special rules</E>—(A)<E T="03"> Multi-tiered prescription drug benefits.</E> If a State or plan administrator applies different levels of financial requirements to different tiers of prescription drug benefits based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the rules in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section (relating to requirements for nonquantitative treatment limitations) and without regard to whether a drug is generally prescribed for medical/surgical benefits or for mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the ABP satisfies the parity requirements of this paragraph (b) for prescription drug benefits. Reasonable factors include cost, efficacy, generic versus brand name, and mail order versus pharmacy pick-up/delivery.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Sub-classifications permitted for office visits, separate from other outpatient services.</E> For purposes of applying the financial requirement and treatment limitation rules of this paragraph (b), a State may divide its benefits furnished on an outpatient basis into the two sub-classifications described in this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B). After the sub-classifications are established, the State may not impose any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any sub-classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the sub-classification using the methodology set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Sub-classifications other than these special rules, such as separate sub-classifications for generalists and specialists, are not permitted. The two sub-classifications permitted under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) are:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Office visits (such as physician visits); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) All other outpatient items and services (such as outpatient surgery, laboratory services, or other medical items).</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">No separate cumulative financial requirements.</E> A State may not apply any cumulative financial requirement for mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a classification that accumulates separately from any established for medical/surgical benefits in the same classification.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Compliance with other cost-sharing rules.</E> States must meet the requirements of §§ 447.50 through 447.57 of this chapter when applying Medicaid cost-sharing.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Nonquantitative treatment limitations</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A State may not impose a nonquantitative treatment limitation for mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification unless, under the terms of the ABP as written and in operation, any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in the classification are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the limitation for medical/surgical benefits in the classification.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.</E> Nonquantitative treatment limitations include—</P>
              <P>(A) Medical management standards limiting or excluding benefits based on medical necessity or medical appropriateness, or based on whether the treatment is experimental or investigative;</P>
              <P>(B) Formulary design for prescription drugs;</P>
              <P>(C) Standards for provider admission to participate in a network, including reimbursement rates;</P>
              <P>(D) Methods for determining usual, customary, and reasonable charges;</P>

              <P>(E) Refusal to pay for higher-cost therapies until it can be shown that a <PRTPAGE P="362"/>lower-cost therapy is not effective (also known as fail-first policies or step therapy protocols);</P>
              <P>(F) Exclusions based on failure to complete a course of treatment; and</P>
              <P>(G) Restrictions based on geographic location, facility type, provider specialty, and other criteria that limit the scope or duration of benefits or services provided under the ABP.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">ABP providing EPSDT benefits.</E> An ABP that provides EPSDT benefits is deemed to be compliant with the parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations with respect to individuals entitled to such benefits. Annual or lifetime limits are not permissible in EPSDT benefits.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Availability of information</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criteria for medical necessity determinations.</E> The criteria for medical necessity determinations made by the State for beneficiaries served through the ABP for mental health or substance use disorder benefits must be made available by the State to any beneficiary or Medicaid provider upon request.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reason for any denial.</E> The reason for any denial made by the State in the case of a beneficiary served through an ABP of reimbursement or payment for services for mental health or substance use disorder benefits must be made available by the State to the beneficiary.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Provisions of other law.</E> Compliance with the disclosure requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section is not determinative of compliance with any other provision of applicable Federal or State law.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Applicability</E>—(1) <E T="03">ABPs.</E> The requirements of this section apply to States providing benefits through ABPs. For those States providing ABPs through an MCO, PIHP, or PAHP, the rules of 42 CFR part 438, subpart K also apply, and approved contracts will be viewed as evidence of compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section does not—</P>
              <P>(i) Require a State to provide any specific mental health benefits or substance use disorder benefits; however, in providing coverage through an ABP, the State must include EHBs, including the ten EHBs as required in § 440.347, which include mental health and substance use disorder benefits; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Affect the terms and conditions relating to the amount, duration, or scope of mental health or substance use disorder benefits under the ABP except as specifically provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">State plan requirement.</E> If a State plan provides for an ABP, the State must provide sufficient information in ABP State plan amendment requests to assure compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Compliance dates</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> ABP coverage offered by States must comply with the requirements of this section no later than October 2, 2017.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Assets</E> includes but is not limited to any listing that identifies Medicaid beneficiaries to whom home health services were furnished by a participating or formerly participating HHA.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Participating home health agency</E> means a “home health agency” (HHA) as that term is defined at § 440.70(d) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Surety bond</E> means one or more bonds issued by one or more surety companies under 31 U.S.C. 9304 to 9308 and 31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 225, provided the bond otherwise meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Uncollected overpayment</E> means an “overpayment,” as that term is defined under § 433.304 of this subchapter, plus accrued interest, for which the HHA is responsible, that has not been recouped by the Medicaid agency within a time period determined by the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Prohibition.</E> FFP is not available in expenditures for home health services under § 440.70 of this subchapter unless the home health agency furnishing these services meets the surety bond requirements of paragraphs (c) through (l) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Obtain a surety bond that meets the requirements of this section and instructions issued by the Medicaid agency; and</P>
              <P>(2) Furnish a copy of the surety bond to the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Requirement waived for Government-operated HHAs.</E> An HHA operated by a Federal, State, local, or tribal government agency is deemed to have provided the Medicaid agency with a comparable surety bond under State law, and is therefore exempt from the requirements of this section if, during the preceding 5 years, the HHA has not had any uncollected overpayments.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Parties to the bond.</E> The surety bond must name the HHA as Principal, the Medicaid agency as Obligee, and the surety company (and its heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assignees, jointly and severally) as Surety.<PRTPAGE P="367"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Authorized Surety and exclusion of surety companies.</E> An HHA may obtain a surety bond required under this section only from an authorized Surety.</P>
              <P>(1) An authorized Surety is a surety company that—</P>
              <P>(i) Has been issued a Certificate of Authority by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9304 to 9308 and 31 CFR parts 223, 224, and 225 as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds and the Certificate has neither expired nor been revoked;</P>
              <P>(ii) Has not been determined by the Medicaid agency to be an unauthorized Surety for the purpose of an HHA obtaining a surety bond under this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Meets other conditions, as specified by the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(2) The Medicaid agency may determine that a surety company is an unauthorized Surety under this section—</P>
              <P>(i) If, upon request by the Medicaid agency, the surety company fails to furnish timely confirmation of the issuance of, and the validity and accuracy of information appearing on, a surety bond that an HHA presents to the Medicaid agency that shows the surety company as Surety on the bond;</P>
              <P>(ii) If, upon presentation by the Medicaid agency to the surety company of a request for payment on a surety bond and of sufficient evidence to establish the surety company's liability on the bond, the surety company fails to timely pay the Medicaid agency in full the amount requested up to the face amount of the bond; or</P>
              <P>(iii) For other good cause.</P>
              <P>(3) The Medicaid agency must specify the manner by which public notification of a determination under paragraph (f)(2) of this section is given and the effective date of the determination.</P>
              <P>(4) A determination by the Medicaid agency that a surety company is an unauthorized Surety under paragraph (f)(2) of this section—</P>
              <P>(i) Has effect only within the State; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Is not a debarment, suspension, or exclusion for the purposes of Executive Order No. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Amount of the bond</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> The amount of the surety bond must be $50,000 or 15 percent of the annual Medicaid payments made to the HHA by the Medicaid agency for home health services furnished under this subchapter for which FFP is available, whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computation of the 15 percent: Participating HHA.</E> The 15 percent is computed by the Medicaid agency on the basis of Medicaid payments made to the HHA for the most recent annual period for which information is available as specified by the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Computation of 15 percent: An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA by obtaining assets or ownership interest.</E> For an HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA by purchasing the assets or the ownership interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA, the 15 percent is computed on the basis of Medicaid payments made by the Medicaid agency to the participating or formerly participating HHA for the most recent annual period as specified by the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Computation of 15 percent: Change of ownership.</E> For an HHA that undergoes a change of ownership (as “change of ownership” is defined by the State Medicaid agency) the 15 percent is computed on the basis of Medicaid payments made by the Medicaid agency to the HHA for the most recent annual period as specified by the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA without obtaining assets or ownership interest.</E> For an HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA without purchasing the assets or the ownership interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA, the 15 percent computation does not apply.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Exception to the basic rule.</E> If an HHA's overpayment in the most recent annual period exceeds 15 percent, the State Medicaid agency may require the HHA to secure a bond in an amount up to or equal to the amount of the overpayment, provided the amount of the bond is not less than $50,000.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Expiration of the 15 percent provision.</E> For an annual surety bond, or for a rider on a continuous surety bond, that is required to be submitted on or after June 1, 2005, notwithstanding any reference in this section to 15 percent as a basis for determining the amount of the bond, the amount of the bond or <PRTPAGE P="368"/>rider, as applicable, must be $50,000 or such amount as the Medicaid agency specifies in accordance with paragraph (g)(6) of this section, whichever amount is greater.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Additional requirements of the surety bond.</E> The surety bond that an HHA obtains under this section must meet the following additional requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The bond must guarantee that, upon written demand by the Medicaid agency to the Surety for payment under the bond and the Medicaid agency furnishing to the Surety sufficient evidence to establish the Surety's liability under the bond, the Surety will timely pay the Medicaid agency the amount so demanded, up to the stated amount of the bond.</P>
              <P>(2) The bond must provide that the Surety is liable for uncollected overpayments, as defined in paragraph (a), provided such uncollected overpayments are determined during the term of the bond and regardless of when the overpayments took place. Further, the bond must provide that the Surety remains liable if the HHA fails to furnish a subsequent annual bond that meets the requirements of this subpart or fails to furnish a rider for a year for which a rider is required to be submitted, or if the HHA's provider agreement terminates and that the Surety's liability shall be based on the last bond or rider in effect for the HHA, which shall then remain in effect for an additional 2-year period.</P>
              <P>(3) The bond must provide that the Surety's liability to the Medicaid agency is not extinguished by any of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Any action by the HHA or the Surety to terminate or limit the scope or term of the bond. The Surety's liability may be extinguished, however, when—</P>
              <P>(A) The Surety furnishes the Medicaid agency with notice of such action not later than 10 days after receiving notice from the HHA of action by the HHA to terminate or limit the scope of the bond, or not later than 60 days before the effective date of such action by the Surety; or</P>
              <P>(B) The HHA furnishes the Medicaid agency with a new bond that meets the requirements of both this section and the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Surety's failure to continue to meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section or the Medicaid agency's determination that the surety company is an unauthorized surety under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Termination of the HHA's provider agreement described under § 431.107 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(iv) Any action by the Medicaid agency to suspend, offset, or otherwise recover payments to the HHA.</P>
              <P>(v) Any action by the HHA to—</P>
              <P>(A) Cease operation;</P>
              <P>(B) Sell or transfer any assets or ownership interest;</P>
              <P>(C) File for bankruptcy; or</P>
              <P>(D) Fail to pay the Surety.</P>
              <P>(vi) Any fraud, misrepresentation, or negligence by the HHA in obtaining the surety bond or by the Surety (or by the Surety's agent, if any) in issuing the surety bond, except that any fraud, misrepresentation, or negligence by the HHA in identifying to the Surety (or to the Surety's agent) the amount of Medicaid payments upon which the amount of the surety bond is determined shall not cause the Surety's liability to the Medicaid agency to exceed the amount of the bond.</P>
              <P>(vii) The HHA's failure to exercise available appeal rights under Medicaid or to assign such rights to the Surety (provided the Medicaid agency permits such rights to be assigned).</P>
              <P>(4) The bond must provide that actions under the bond may be brought by the Medicaid agency or by an agent that the Medicaid agency designates.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Term and type of bond</E>—(1) <E T="03">Initial term:</E> Each participating HHA that is not exempted by paragraph (d) of this section must submit to the State Medicaid agency a surety bond for a term beginning January 1, 1998. If an annual bond is submitted for the initial term it must be effective for an annual period specified by the State Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Type of bond.</E> The type of bond required to be submitted by an HHA, under this section, may be either—</P>

              <P>(i) An annual bond (that is, a bond that specifies an effective annual period that corresponds to an annual period specified by the Medicaid agency); or<PRTPAGE P="369"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) A continuous bond (that is, a bond that remains in full force and effect from term to term unless it is terminated or canceled as provided for in the bond or as otherwise provided by law) that is updated by the Surety for a particular period, via the issuance of a “rider,” when the bond amount changes. For the purposes of this section, “Rider” means a notice issued by a Surety that a change to a bond has occurred or will occur. If the HHA has submitted a continuous bond and there is no increase or decrease in the bond amount, no action is necessary by the HHA to submit a rider as long as the continuous bond remains in full force and effect.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA.</E> (i) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA must submit a surety bond before a provider agreement described under § 431.107 of this subchapter can be entered into.</P>
              <P>(ii) An HHA that seeks to become a participating HHA through the purchase or transfer of assets or ownership interest of a participating or formerly participating HHA must also ensure that the surety bond is effective from the date of such purchase or transfer.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Change of ownership.</E> An HHA that undergoes a change of ownership (as “change of ownership” is defined by the State Medicaid agency) must submit the surety bond to the State Medicaid agency by such time and for such term as is specified in the instructions of the State Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Government-operated HHA that loses its waiver.</E> A government-operated HHA that, as of January 1, 1998, meets the criteria for waiver of the requirements of this section but thereafter is determined by the Medicaid agency to not meet such criteria, must submit a surety bond to the Medicaid agency within 60 days after it receives notice from the Medicaid agency that it does not meet the criteria for waiver.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Change of Surety.</E> An HHA that obtains a replacement surety bond from a different Surety to cover the remaining term of a previously obtained bond must submit the new surety bond to the Medicaid agency within 60 days (or such earlier date as the Medicaid agency may specify) of obtaining the bond from the new Surety for a term specified by the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Effect of failure to obtain, maintain, and timely file a surety bond.</E> (1) The Medicaid agency must terminate the HHA's provider agreement if the HHA fails to obtain, file timely, and maintain a surety bond in accordance with this section and the Medicaid agency's instructions.</P>
              <P>(2) The Medicaid agency must refuse to enter into a provider agreement with an HHA if an HHA seeking to become a participating HHA fails to obtain and file timely a surety bond in accordance with this section and instructions issued by the State Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Evidence of compliance.</E> (1) The Medicaid agency may at any time require an HHA to make a specific showing of being in compliance with the requirements of this section and may require the HHA to submit such additional evidence as the Medicaid agency considers sufficient to demonstrate the HHA's compliance.</P>
              <P>(2) The Medicaid agency may terminate the HHA's provider agreement or refuse to enter into a provider agreement if an HHA fails to timely furnish sufficient evidence at the Medicaid agency's request to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Surety's standing to appeal Medicaid determinations.</E> The Medicaid agency must establish procedures for granting appeal rights to Sureties.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Effect of conditions of payment.</E> If a Surety has paid the Medicaid agency an amount on the basis of liability incurred under a bond obtained by an HHA under this section, and the Medicaid agency subsequently collects from the HHA, in whole or in part, on such overpayment that was the basis for the Surety's liability, the Medicaid agency must reimburse the Surety such amount as the Medicaid agency collected from the HHA, up to the amount paid by the Surety to the Medicaid agency, provided the Surety has no other liability under the bond.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Informing.</E> The agency must—</P>
              <P>(1) Provide for a combination of written and oral methods designed to inform effectively all EPSDT eligible individuals (or their families) about the EPSDT program.</P>
              <P>(2) Using clear and nontechnical language, provide information about the following—</P>
              <P>(i) The benefits of preventive health care;</P>
              <P>(ii) The services available under the EPSDT program and where and how to obtain those services;</P>
              <P>(iii) That the services provided under the EPSDT program are without cost to eligible individuals under 18 years of age, and if the agency chooses, to those 18 or older, up to age 21, except for any enrollment fee, premium, or similar charge that may be imposed on medically needy beneficiaries; and</P>
              <P>(iv) That necessary transportation and scheduling assistance described in § 441.62 of this subpart is available to the EPSDT eligible individual upon request.</P>
              <P>(3) Effectively inform those individuals who are blind or deaf, or who cannot read or understand the English language.</P>
              <P>(4) Provide assurance to CMS that processes are in place to effectively inform individuals as required under this paragraph, generally, within 60 days of the individual's initial Medicaid eligibility determination and in the case of families which have not utilized EPSDT services, annually thereafter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Screening.</E> (1) The agency must provide to eligible EPSDT beneficiaries who request it, screening (periodic comprehensive child health assessments); that is, regularly scheduled examinations and evaluations of the general physical and mental health, growth, development, and nutritional status of infants, children, and youth. (See paragraph (c)(3) of this section for requirements relating to provision of immunization at the time of screening.) As a minimum, these screenings must include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Comprehensive health and developmental history.</P>
              <P>(ii) Comprehensive unclothed physical examination.</P>
              <P>(iii) Appropriate vision testing.</P>

              <P>(v) Appropriate laboratory tests.</P>
              <P>(vi) Dental screening services furnished by direct referral to a dentist for children beginning at 3 years of age. An agency may request from CMS an exception from this age requirement (within an outer limit of age 5) for a two year period and may request additional two year exceptions. If an agency requests an exception, it must demonstrate to CMS's satisfaction that there is a shortage of dentists that prevents the agency from meeting the age 3 requirement.</P>
              <P>(2) Screening services in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be provided in accordance with reasonable standards of medical and dental practice determined by the agency after consultation with recognized medical and dental organizations involved in child health care.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Diagnosis and treatment.</E> In addition to any diagnostic and treatment services included in the plan, the agency must provide to eligible EPSDT beneficiaries, the following services, the need for which is indicated by screening, even if the services are not included in the plan—</P>
              <P>(1) Diagnosis of and treatment for defects in vision and hearing, including eyeglasses and hearing aids;</P>
              <P>(2) Dental care, at as early an age as necessary, needed for relief of pain and infections, restoration of teeth and maintenance of dental health; and</P>
              <P>(3) Appropriate immunizations. (If it is determined at the time of screening that immunization is needed and appropriate to provide at the time of screening, then immunization treatment must be provided at that time.)</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Accountability.</E> The agency must maintain as required by §§ 431.17 and 431.18—</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Timeliness.</E> With the exception of the informing requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must set standards for the timely provision of EPSDT services which meet reasonable standards of medical and dental practice, as determined by the agency after consultation with recognized medical and dental organizations involved in child health care, and must employ processes to ensure timely initiation of treatment, if required, generally within an outer limit of 6 months after the request for screening services.</P>

              <P>(5) At the provider's option, provision of all or part of the transportation and scheduling assistance as required under § 441.62. The provider must specify in the agreement the transportation and scheduling assistance to be furnished. If the provider does not choose to provide some or all of the assistance, then the provider must refer beneficiaries to the agency to obtain the transportation and scheduling assistance required under § 441.62.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reports.</E> A continuing care provider must provide to the agency any <PRTPAGE P="375"/>reports that the agency may reasonably require.</P>

              <P>I have asked for and received information about sterilization from (doctor or clinic). When I first asked for the information, I was told that the decision to be sterilized is completely up to me. I was told that I could decide not to be sterilized. If I decide not to be sterilized, my decision will not affect my right to future care or treatment. I will not lose any help or benefits from programs receiving Federal funds, such as A.F.D.C. or Medicaid that I am now getting or for which I may become eligible.</P>
              <P>I understand that the sterilization must be considered permanent and not reversible. I have decided that I do not want to become pregnant, bear children or father children.</P>
              <P>I was told about those temporary methods of birth control that are available and could be provided to me which will allow me to bear or father a child in the future. I have rejected these alternatives and chosen to be sterilized.</P>
              <P>I understand that I will be sterilized by an operation known as a ______. The discomforts, risks and benefits associated with the operation have been explained to me. All my questions have been answered to my satisfaction.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Basis and purpose.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Section 1915(c) of the Act permits States to offer, under a waiver of statutory requirements, an array of home and community-based services that an individual needs to avoid institutionalization. Those services are defined in § 440.180 of this subchapter. This subpart describes what the Medicaid agency must do to obtain a waiver.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 441.301</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Contents of request for a waiver.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A request for a waiver under this section must consist of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The assurances required by § 441.302 and the supporting documentation required by § 441.303.</P>
              <P>(2) When applicable, requests for waivers of the requirements of section 1902(a)(1), section 1902(a)(10)(B), or section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act, which concern respectively, statewide application of Medicaid, comparability of services, and income and resource rules applicable to medically needy individuals living in the community.</P>
              <P>(3) A statement explaining whether the agency will refuse to offer home or community-based services to any beneficiary if the agency can reasonably expect that the cost of the services would exceed the cost of an equivalent level of care provided in—</P>
              <P>(i) A hospital (as defined in § 440.10 of this chapter);</P>
              <P>(ii) A NF (as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act); or</P>
              <P>(iii) An ICF/IID (as defined in § 440.150 of this chapter), if applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) If the agency furnishes home and community-based services, as defined in § 440.180 of this subchapter, under a waiver granted under this subpart, the waiver request must—</P>
              <P>(1) Provide that the services are furnished—</P>
              <P>(i) Under a written person-centered service plan (also called plan of care) that is based on a person-centered approach and is subject to approval by the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(ii) Only to beneficiaries who are not inpatients of a hospital, NF, or ICF/IID; and</P>

              <P>(iii) Only to beneficiaries who the agency determines would, in the absence of these services, require the <PRTPAGE P="388"/>Medicaid covered level of care provided in—</P>
              <P>(A) A hospital (as defined in § 440.10 of this chapter);</P>
              <P>(B) A NF (as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act); or</P>
              <P>(C) An ICF/IID (as defined in § 440.150 of this chapter);</P>
              <P>(2) Describe the qualifications of the individual or individuals who will be responsible for developing the individual plan of care;</P>
              <P>(3) Describe the group or groups of individuals to whom the services will be offered;</P>
              <P>(4) Describe the services to be furnished so that each service is separately defined. Multiple services that are generally considered to be separate services may not be consolidated under a single definition. Commonly accepted terms must be used to describe the service and definitions may not be open ended in scope. CMS will, however, allow combined service definitions (bundling) when this will permit more efficient delivery of services and not compromise either a beneficiary's access to or free choice of providers.</P>
              <P>(5) Provide that the documentation requirements regarding individual evaluation, specified in § 441.303(c), will be met; and</P>
              <P>(6) Be limited to one or more of the following target groups or any subgroup thereof that the State may define:</P>
              <P>(i) Aged or disabled, or both.</P>
              <P>(ii) Individuals with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities, or both.</P>
              <P>(iii) Mentally ill.</P>
              <P>(c) A waiver request under this subpart must include the following—</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Person-centered planning process.</E> The individual will lead the person-centered planning process where possible. The individual's representative should have a participatory role, as needed and as defined by the individual, unless State law confers decision-making authority to the legal representative. All references to individuals include the role of the individual's representative. In addition to being led by the individual receiving services and supports, the person-centered planning process:</P>
              <P>(i) Includes people chosen by the individual.</P>
              <P>(ii) Provides necessary information and support to ensure that the individual directs the process to the maximum extent possible, and is enabled to make informed choices and decisions.</P>
              <P>(iii) Is timely and occurs at times and locations of convenience to the individual.</P>
              <P>(iv) Reflects cultural considerations of the individual and is conducted by providing information in plain language and in a manner that is accessible to individuals with disabilities and persons who are limited English proficient, consistent with § 435.905(b) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(v) Includes strategies for solving conflict or disagreement within the process, including clear conflict-of-interest guidelines for all planning participants.</P>
              <P>(vi) Providers of HCBS for the individual, or those who have an interest in or are employed by a provider of HCBS for the individual must not provide case management or develop the person-centered service plan, except when the State demonstrates that the only willing and qualified entity to provide case management and/or develop person-centered service plans in a geographic area also provides HCBS. In these cases, the State must devise conflict of interest protections including separation of entity and provider functions within provider entities, which must be approved by CMS. Individuals must be provided with a clear and accessible alternative dispute resolution process.</P>
              <P>(vii) Offers informed choices to the individual regarding the services and supports they receive and from whom.</P>
              <P>(viii) Includes a method for the individual to request updates to the plan as needed.</P>
              <P>(ix) Records the alternative home and community-based settings that were considered by the individual.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">The Person-Centered Service Plan.</E> The person-centered service plan must reflect the services and supports that are important for the individual to meet the needs identified through an assessment of functional need, as well as what is important to the individual with regard to preferences for the delivery of such services and supports. Commensurate with the level of need <PRTPAGE P="389"/>of the individual, and the scope of services and supports available under the State's 1915(c) HCBS waiver, the written plan must:</P>
              <P>(i) Reflect that the setting in which the individual resides is chosen by the individual. The State must ensure that the setting chosen by the individual is integrated in, and supports full access of individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS to the greater community, including opportunities to seek employment and work in competitive integrated settings, engage in community life, control personal resources, and receive services in the community to the same degree of access as individuals not receiving Medicaid HCBS.</P>
              <P>(ii) Reflect the individual's strengths and preferences.</P>
              <P>(iii) Reflect clinical and support needs as identified through an assessment of functional need.</P>
              <P>(iv) Include individually identified goals and desired outcomes.</P>
              <P>(v) Reflect the services and supports (paid and unpaid) that will assist the individual to achieve identified goals, and the providers of those services and supports, including natural supports. Natural supports are unpaid supports that are provided voluntarily to the individual in lieu of 1915(c) HCBS waiver services and supports.</P>
              <P>(vi) Reflect risk factors and measures in place to minimize them, including individualized back-up plans and strategies when needed.</P>
              <P>(vii) Be understandable to the individual receiving services and supports, and the individuals important in supporting him or her. At a minimum, for the written plan to be understandable, it must be written in plain language and in a manner that is accessible to individuals with disabilities and persons who are limited English proficient, consistent with § 435.905(b) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(viii) Identify the individual and/or entity responsible for monitoring the plan.</P>
              <P>(ix) Be finalized and agreed to, with the informed consent of the individual in writing, and signed by all individuals and providers responsible for its implementation.</P>
              <P>(x) Be distributed to the individual and other people involved in the plan.</P>
              <P>(xi) Include those services, the purpose or control of which the individual elects to self-direct.</P>
              <P>(xii) Prevent the provision of unnecessary or inappropriate services and supports.</P>
              <P>(xiii) Document that any modification of the additional conditions, under paragraph (c)(4)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section, must be supported by a specific assessed need and justified in the person-centered service plan. The following requirements must be documented in the person-centered service plan:</P>
              <P>(A) Identify a specific and individualized assessed need.</P>
              <P>(B) Document the positive interventions and supports used prior to any modifications to the person-centered service plan.</P>
              <P>(C) Document less intrusive methods of meeting the need that have been tried but did not work.</P>
              <P>(D) Include a clear description of the condition that is directly proportionate to the specific assessed need.</P>
              <P>(E) Include a regular collection and review of data to measure the ongoing effectiveness of the modification.</P>
              <P>(F) Include established time limits for periodic reviews to determine if the modification is still necessary or can be terminated.</P>
              <P>(G) Include informed consent of the individual.</P>
              <P>(H) Include an assurance that interventions and supports will cause no harm to the individual.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review of the Person-Centered Service Plan.</E> The person-centered service plan must be reviewed, and revised upon reassessment of functional need as required by § 441.365(e), at least every 12 months, when the individual's circumstances or needs change significantly, or at the request of the individual.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Home and Community-Based Settings.</E> Home and community-based settings must have all of the following qualities, and such other qualities as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, based on the needs of the individual as indicated in their person-centered service plan:</P>

              <P>(i) The setting is integrated in and supports full access of individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS to the greater <PRTPAGE P="390"/>community, including opportunities to seek employment and work in competitive integrated settings, engage in community life, control personal resources, and receive services in the community, to the same degree of access as individuals not receiving Medicaid HCBS.</P>
              <P>(ii) The setting is selected by the individual from among setting options including non-disability specific settings and an option for a private unit in a residential setting. The setting options are identified and documented in the person-centered service plan and are based on the individual's needs, preferences, and, for residential settings, resources available for room and board.</P>
              <P>(iii) Ensures an individual's rights of privacy, dignity and respect, and freedom from coercion and restraint.</P>
              <P>(iv) Optimizes, but does not regiment, individual initiative, autonomy, and independence in making life choices, including but not limited to, daily activities, physical environment, and with whom to interact.</P>
              <P>(v) Facilitates individual choice regarding services and supports, and who provides them.</P>
              <P>(vi) In a provider-owned or controlled residential setting, in addition to the qualities at § 441.301(c)(4)(i) through (v), the following additional conditions must be met:</P>
              <P>(A) The unit or dwelling is a specific physical place that can be owned, rented, or occupied under a legally enforceable agreement by the individual receiving services, and the individual has, at a minimum, the same responsibilities and protections from eviction that tenants have under the landlord/tenant law of the State, county, city, or other designated entity. For settings in which landlord tenant laws do not apply, the State must ensure that a lease, residency agreement or other form of written agreement will be in place for each HCBS participant, and that the document provides protections that address eviction processes and appeals comparable to those provided under the jurisdiction's landlord tenant law.</P>
              <P>(B) Each individual has privacy in their sleeping or living unit:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Units have entrance doors lockable by the individual, with only appropriate staff having keys to doors.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Individuals sharing units have a choice of roommates in that setting.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Individuals have the freedom to furnish and decorate their sleeping or living units within the lease or other agreement.</P>
              <P>(C) Individuals have the freedom and support to control their own schedules and activities, and have access to food at any time.</P>
              <P>(D) Individuals are able to have visitors of their choosing at any time.</P>
              <P>(E) The setting is physically accessible to the individual.</P>
              <P>(F) Any modification of the additional conditions, under § 441.301(c)(4)(vi)(A) through (D), must be supported by a specific assessed need and justified in the person-centered service plan. The following requirements must be documented in the person-centered service plan:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Identify a specific and individualized assessed need.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Document the positive interventions and supports used prior to any modifications to the person-centered service plan.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Document less intrusive methods of meeting the need that have been tried but did not work.</P>

              <P>(5) <E T="03">Settings that are not Home and Community-Based.</E> Home and community-based settings do not include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A nursing facility;</P>
              <P>(ii) An institution for mental diseases;</P>

              <P>(iii) An intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities;<PRTPAGE P="391"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) A hospital; or</P>
              <P>(v) Any other locations that have qualities of an institutional setting, as determined by the Secretary. Any setting that is located in a building that is also a publicly or privately operated facility that provides inpatient institutional treatment, or in a building on the grounds of, or immediately adjacent to, a public institution, or any other setting that has the effect of isolating individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS from the broader community of individuals not receiving Medicaid HCBS will be presumed to be a setting that has the qualities of an institution unless the Secretary determines through heightened scrutiny, based on information presented by the State or other parties, that the setting does not have the qualities of an institution and that the setting does have the qualities of home and community-based settings.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(i) States submitting new and initial waiver requests must provide assurances of compliance with the requirements of this section for home and community-based settings as of the effective date of the waiver.</P>
              <P>(ii) CMS will require transition plans for existing section 1915(c) waivers and approved state plans providing home and community-based services under section 1915(i) to achieve compliance with this section, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For each approved section 1915(c) HCBS waiver subject to renewal or submitted for amendment within one year after the effective date of this regulation, the State must submit a transition plan at the time of the waiver renewal or amendment request that sets forth the actions the State will take to bring the specific waiver into compliance with this section. The waiver approval will be contingent on the inclusion of the transition plan approved by CMS. The transition plan must include all elements required by the Secretary; and within one hundred and twenty days of the submission of the first waiver renewal or amendment request the State must submit a transition plan detailing how the State will operate all section 1915(c) HCBS waivers and any section 1915(i) State plan benefit in accordance with this section. The transition plan must include all elements including timelines and deliverables as approved by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(B) For States that do not have a section 1915(c) HCBS waiver or a section 1915(i) State plan benefit due for renewal or proposed for amendments within one year of the effective date of this regulation, the State must submit a transition plan detailing how the State will operate all section 1915(c) HCBS waivers and any section 1915(i) State plan benefit in accordance with this section. This plan must be submitted no later than one year after the effective date of this regulation. The transition plan must include all elements including timelines and deliverables as approved by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(iii) A State must provide at least a 30-day public notice and comment period regarding the transition plan(s) that the State intends to submit to CMS for review and consideration, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The State must at a minimum provide two (2) statements of public notice and public input procedures.</P>
              <P>(B) The State must ensure the full transition plan(s) is available to the public for public comment.</P>
              <P>(C) The State must consider and modify the transition plan, as the State deems appropriate, to account for public comment.</P>
              <P>(iv) A State must submit to CMS, with the proposed transition plan:</P>
              <P>(A) Evidence of the public notice required.</P>
              <P>(B) A summary of the comments received during the public notice period, reasons why comments were not adopted, and any modifications to the transition plan based upon those comments.</P>

              <P>(v) Upon approval by CMS, the State will begin implementation of the transition plans. The State's failure to submit an approvable transition plan as required by this section and/or to comply with the terms of the approved transition plan may result in compliance actions, including but not limited <PRTPAGE P="392"/>to deferral/disallowance of Federal Financial Participation.</P>

              <P>Unless the Medicaid agency provides the following satisfactory assurances to CMS, CMS will not grant a waiver under this subpart and may terminate a waiver already granted:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Health and Welfare</E>—Assurance that necessary safeguards have been taken to protect the health and welfare of the beneficiaries of the services. Those safeguards must include—</P>

              <P>(2) Assurance that the standards of any State licensure or certification requirements are met for services or for individuals furnishing services that are provided under the waiver; and</P>
              <P>(3) Assurance that all facilities covered by section 1616(e) of the Act, in which home and community-based services will be provided, are in compliance with applicable State standards that meet the requirements of 45 CFR part 1397 for board and care facilities.</P>
              <P>(4) Assurance that the State is able to meet the unique service needs of the individuals when the State elects to serve more than one target group under a single waiver, as specified in § 441.301(b)(6).</P>
              <P>(i) On an annual basis the State will include in the quality section of the CMS-372 form (or any successor form designated by CMS) data that indicates the State continues to serve multiple target groups in the single waiver and that a single target group is not being prioritized to the detriment of other groups.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(5) Assurance that services are provided in home and community based settings, as specified in § 441.301(c)(4).</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Initial evaluation.</E> An evaluation of the need for the level of care provided in a hospital, a NF, or an ICF/IID when there is a reasonable indication that a beneficiary might need the services in the near future (that is, a month or less) unless he or she receives home or community-based services. For purposes of this section, “evaluation” means a review of an individual beneficiary's condition to determine—</P>
              <P>(i) If the beneficiary requires the level of care provided in a hospital as defined in § 440.10 of this subchapter, a NF as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act, or an ICF/IID as defined by § 440.150 of this subchapter; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That the beneficiary, but for the provision of waiver services, would otherwise be institutionalized in such a facility.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Periodic reevaluations.</E> Reevaluations, at least annually, of each beneficiary receiving home or community-based services to determine if the beneficiary continues to need the level of care provided and would, but for the provision of waiver services, otherwise be institutionalized in one of the following institutions:</P>
              <P>(i) A hospital;</P>
              <P>(ii) A NF; or</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternatives</E>—Assurance that when a beneficiary is determined to be likely to require the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, or ICF/IID, the beneficiary or his or her legal representative will be—</P>
              <P>(1) Informed of any feasible alternatives available under the waiver; and</P>
              <P>(2) Given the choice of either institutional or home and community-based services.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Average per capita expenditures.</E> Assurance that the average per capita fiscal year expenditures under the waiver will not exceed 100 percent of the average per capita expenditures that would <PRTPAGE P="393"/>have been made in the fiscal year for the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, or ICF/IID under the State plan had the waiver not been granted.</P>
              <P>(1) These expenditures must be reasonably estimated and documented by the agency.</P>
              <P>(2) The estimate must be on an annual basis and must cover each year of the waiver period.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Actual total expenditures.</E> Assurance that the agency's actual total expenditures for home and community-based and other Medicaid services under the waiver and its claim for FFP in expenditures for the services provided to beneficiaries under the waiver will not, in any year of the waiver period, exceed 100 percent of the amount that would be incurred by the State's Medicaid program for these individuals, absent the waiver, in—</P>

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Institutionalization absent waiver.</E> Assurance that, absent the waiver, beneficiaries in the waiver would receive the appropriate type of Medicaid-funded institutional care (hospital, NF, or ICF/IID) that they require.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> Assurance that annually, the agency will provide CMS with information on the waiver's impact. The information must be consistent with a data collection plan designed by CMS and must address the waiver's impact on—</P>
              <P>(1) The type, amount, and cost of services provided under the State plan; and</P>
              <P>(2) The health and welfare of beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Habilitation services.</E> Assurance that prevocational, educational, or supported employment services, or a combination of these services, if provided as habilitation services under the waiver, are—</P>
              <P>(1) Not otherwise available to the individual through a local educational agency under section 602 (16) and (17) of the Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. 1401 (16 and 17)) or as services under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 730); and</P>

              <P>The agency must furnish CMS with sufficient information to support the assurances required by § 441.302. Except as CMS may otherwise specify for particular waivers, the information must consist of the following:</P>
              <P>(a) A description of the safeguards necessary to protect the health and welfare of beneficiaries. This information must include a copy of the standards established by the State for facilities that are covered by section 1616(e) of the Act.</P>

              <P>(3) The agency's procedure to ensure the maintenance of written documentation on all evaluations and reevaluations; and</P>
              <P>(4) The agency's procedure to ensure reevaluations of need at regular intervals.</P>
              <P>(d) A description of the agency's plan for informing eligible beneficiaries of the feasible alternatives available under the waiver and allowing beneficiaries to choose either institutional services or home and community-based services.</P>
              <P>(e) An explanation of how the agency will apply the applicable provisions regarding the post-eligibility treatment of income and resources of those individuals receiving home and community-based services who are eligible under a special income level (included in § 435.217 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(f) An explanation with supporting documentation satisfactory to CMS of how the agency estimated the average per capita expenditures for services.</P>

              <P>(1) The annual average per capita expenditure estimate of the cost of home and community-based and other Medicaid services under the waiver must not exceed the estimated annual average per capita expenditures of the cost of services in the absence of a waiver. The estimates are to be based on the following equation:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D + D′ ≤G + G′.</FP>
              
              <EXTRACT>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">The symbol “≤” means that the result of the left side of the equation must be less than or <E T="03">equal</E> to the result of the right side of the equation.</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for home and community-based services for individuals in the waiver program.</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D′ = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for all other services provided to individuals in the waiver program.</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">G = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid cost for hospital, NF, or ICF/IID care that would be incurred for individuals served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted.</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">G′ = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid costs for all services other than those included in factor G for individuals served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted.</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(2) For purposes of the equation, the prime factors include the average per capita cost for all State plan services and expanded EPSDT services provided that are not accounted for in other formula values.</P>
              <P>(3) In making estimates of average per capita expenditures for a waiver that applies only to individuals with a particular illness (for example, acquired immune deficiency syndrome) or condition (for example, chronic mental illness) who are inpatients in or who would require the level of care provided in hospitals as defined by § 440.10, NFs as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act, or ICFs/IID, the agency may determine the average per capita expenditures for these individuals absent the waiver without including expenditures for other individuals in the affected hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/IID.</P>
              <P>(4) In making estimates of average per capita expenditures for a separate waiver program that applies only to individuals identified through the preadmission screening annual resident review (PASARR) process who are developmentally disabled, inpatients of a NF, and require the level of care provided in an ICF/IID as determined by the State on the basis of an evaluation under § 441.303(c), the agency may determine the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals based on the average per capita expenditures for inpatients in an ICF/IID. When submitting estimates of institutional costs without the waiver, the agency may use the average per capita costs of ICF/IID care even though the deinstitutionalized developmentally disabled were inpatients of NFs.</P>
              <P>(5) For persons diverted rather than deinstitutionalized, the State's evaluation process required by § 441.303(c) must provide for a more detailed description of their evaluation and screening procedures for beneficiaries to ensure that waiver services will be limited to persons who would otherwise receive the level of care provided in a hospital, NF, or ICF/IID, as applicable.</P>

              <P>(6) The State must indicate the number of unduplicated beneficiaries to which it intends to provide waiver services in each year of its program. This number will constitute a limit on <PRTPAGE P="395"/>the size of the waiver program unless the State requests and the Secretary approves a greater number of waiver participants in a waiver amendment.</P>
              <P>(7) In determining the average per capita expenditures that would have been made in a waiver year, for waiver estimates that apply to persons with Intellectual Disability or related conditions, the agency may include costs of Medicaid residents in ICFs/IID that have been terminated on or after November 5, 1990.</P>
              <P>(8) In submitting estimates for waivers that include personal caregivers as a waiver service, the agency may include a portion of the rent and food attributed to the unrelated personal caregiver who resides in the home or residence of the beneficiary covered under the waiver. The agency must submit to CMS for review and approval the method it uses to apportion the costs of rent and food. The method must be explained fully to CMS. A personal caregiver provides a waiver service to meet the beneficiary's physical, social, or emotional needs (as opposed to services not directly related to the care of the beneficiary; that is, housekeeping or chore services). FFP for live-in caregivers is not available if the beneficiary lives in the caregiver's home or in a residence that is owned or leased by the caregiver.</P>
              <P>(9) In submitting estimates for waivers that apply to individuals with Intellectual Disability or a related condition, the agency may adjust its estimate of average per capita expenditures to include increases in expenditures for ICF/IID care resulting from implementation of a PASARR program for making determinations for individuals with Intellectual Disability or related conditions on or after January 1, 1989.</P>
              <P>(10) For a State that has CMS approval to bundle waiver services, the State must continue to compute separately the costs and utilization of the component services that make up the bundled service to support the final cost and utilization of the bundled service that will be used in the cost-neutrality formula.</P>
              <P>(g) The State, at its option, may provide for an independent assessment of its waiver that evaluates the quality of care provided, access to care, and cost-neutrality. The results of the assessment should be submitted to CMS at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the approved waiver-period and cover the first 24 or 48 months of the waiver. If a State chooses to provide for an independent assessment, FFP is available for the costs attributable to the independent assessment.</P>

              <P>(i) For States offering home and community-based services for individuals diagnosed as chronically mentally ill, an explanation of why these individuals would not be placed in an institution for mental diseases (IMD) absent the waiver, and the age group of these individuals.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duration, extension, and amendment of a waiver.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The effective date for a new waiver of Medicaid requirements to provide home and community-based services approved under this subpart is established by CMS prospectively on or after the date of approval and after consultation with the State agency. The initial approved waiver continues for a 3-year period from the effective date. If the agency requests it, the waiver may be extended for additional periods unless—</P>
              <P>(1) CMS's review of the prior waiver period shows that the assurances required by § 441.302 were not met; and</P>

              <P>(2) CMS is not satisfied with the assurances and documentation provided by the State in regard to the extension period.<PRTPAGE P="396"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) CMS will determine whether a request for extension of an existing waiver is actually an extension request or a request for a new waiver. If a State submits an extension request that would add a new group to the existing group of beneficiaries covered under the waiver (as defined under § 441.301(b)(6)), CMS will consider it to be two requests: One as an extension request for the existing group, and the other as a new waiver request for the new group. Waivers may be extended for additional 5-year periods.</P>
              <P>(c) CMS <E T="03">may</E> grant a State an extension of its existing waiver for up to 90 days to permit the State to document more fully the satisfaction of statutory and regulatory requirements needed to approve a new waiver request. CMS will consider this option when it requests additional information on a new waiver request submitted by a State to extend its existing waiver or when CMS disapproves a State's request for extension.</P>
              <P>(d) The agency may request that waiver modifications be made effective retroactive to the first day of a waiver year, or another date after the first day of a waiver year, in which the amendment is submitted, unless the amendment involves substantive changes as determined by CMS.</P>
              <P>(1) Substantive changes include, but are not limited to, revisions to services available under the waiver including elimination or reduction of services, or reduction in the scope, amount, and duration of any service, a change in the qualifications of service providers, changes in rate methodology or a constriction in the eligible population.</P>
              <P>(2) A request for an amendment that involves a substantive change as determined by CMS, may only take effect on or after the date when the amendment is approved by CMS, and must be accompanied by information on how the State has assured smooth transitions and minimal effect on individuals adversely impacted by the change.</P>
              <P>(e) The agency must provide public notice of any significant proposed change in its methods and standards for setting payment rates for services in accordance with § 447.205 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(f) The agency must establish and use a public input process, for any changes in the services or operations of the waiver.</P>
              <P>(1) This process must be described fully in the State's waiver application and be sufficient in light of the scope of the changes proposed, to ensure meaningful opportunities for input for individuals served, or eligible to be served, in the waiver.</P>
              <P>(2) This process must be completed at a minimum of 30 days prior to implementation of the proposed change or submission of the proposed change to CMS, whichever comes first.</P>
              <P>(3) This process must be used for both existing waivers that have substantive changes proposed, either through the renewal or the amendment process, and new waivers.</P>
              <P>(4) This process must include consultation with Federally-recognized Tribes, and in accordance with section 5006(e) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5), Indian health programs and Urban Indian Organizations.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) If CMS finds that the Medicaid agency is not meeting one or more of the requirements for a waiver contained in this subpart, the agency is given a notice of CMS' findings and an opportunity for a hearing to rebut the findings.</P>
              <P>(2) If CMS determines that the agency is substantively out of compliance with this subpart after the notice and any hearing, CMS may employ strategies to ensure compliance as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section or terminate the waiver.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Strategies to ensure compliance may include the imposition of a moratorium on waiver enrollments, other corrective strategies as appropriate to ensure the health and welfare of waiver participants, or the withholding of a portion of Federal payment for waiver services until such time that compliance is achieved, or other actions as determined by the Secretary as necessary to address non-compliance with 1915(c) of the Act, or termination. When a waiver is terminated, the State must comport with § 441.307.</P>

              <P>(ii) CMS will provide states with a written notice of the impending strategies to ensure compliance for a waiver <PRTPAGE P="397"/>program. The notice of CMS' intent to utilize strategies to ensure compliance would include the nature of the noncompliance, the strategy to be employed, the effective date of the compliance strategy, the criteria for removing the compliance strategy and the opportunity for a hearing.</P>

              <P>Section 1915(d) of the Act permits States to offer, under a waiver of statutory requirements, home and community-based services not otherwise available under Medicaid to individuals age 65 or older, in exchange for accepting an aggregate limit on the amount of expenditures for which they claim FFP for certain services furnished to these individuals. The home and community-based services that may be furnished are listed in § 440.181 of this subchapter. This subpart describes the procedures the Medicaid agency must follow to request a waiver.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contents of a request for a waiver.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A request for a waiver under this section must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Required signatures.</E> The request must be signed by the Governor, the Director of the Medicaid agency or the Director of the larger State agency of which the Medicaid agency is a component or any official of the Medicaid agency to whom this authority has been delegated. A request from any other agency of State government will not be accepted.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Assurances and supporting documentation.</E> The request must provide the assurances required by § 441.352 of this part and the supporting documentation required by § 441.353.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Statement for sections of the Act.</E> The request must provide a statement as to whether waiver of section 1902(a)(1), 1902(a)(10)(B), or 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act is requested. If the State requests a waiver of section 1902(a)(1) of the Act, the waiver must clearly specify the geographic areas or political subdivisions in which the services will be offered. The State must indicate whether it is requesting a waiver of one or all of these sections. The State may request a waiver of any one of the sections cited above.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Identification of services.</E> The request must identify all services available under the approved State plan, which are also included in the APEL and which are identified under § 440.181, and any limitations that the State has <PRTPAGE P="399"/>imposed on the provision of any service. The request must also identify and describe each service specified in § 440.181 of this subchapter to be furnished under the waiver, and any additional services to be furnished under the authority of § 440.181(b)(7). Descriptions of additional services must explain how each additional service included under § 440.181(b)(7) will contribute to the health and well-being of the beneficiaries and to their ability to reside in a community-based setting.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Beneficiaries served.</E> The request must provide that the home and community-based services described in § 440.181 of this subchapter, are furnished only to individuals who—</P>
              <P>(1) Are age 65 or older;</P>
              <P>(2) Are not inpatients of a hospital, NF, or ICF/IID; and</P>
              <P>(3) The agency determines would be likely to require the care furnished in a NF under Medicaid.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Plan of care.</E> The request must provide that the home and community-based services described in § 440.181 of this subchapter, are furnished under a written plan of care based on an assessment of the individual's health and welfare needs and developed by qualified individuals for each beneficiary under the waiver. The qualifications of the individual or individuals who will be responsible for developing the individual plan of care must be described. Each plan of care must contain, at a minimum, the medical and other services to be provided, their frequency, and the type of provider to furnish them. Plans of care must be subject to the approval of the Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Medicaid agency review.</E> The request must assure that the State agency maintain and exercise its authority to review (at a minimum) a valid statistical sample of each month's plans of care. When the services in a plan do not comport with the stated disabilities and needs of the beneficiary, the agency must implement immediate corrective action procedures to ensure that the needs of the beneficiary are adequately addressed.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Groups served.</E> The request must describe the group or groups of individuals to whom the services will be offered.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Assurances regarding amount expended.</E> The request must assure that the total amount expended by the State under the plan for individuals age 65 or older during a waiver year for medical assistance with respect to NF, home health, private duty nursing, personal care, and home and community-based services described in §§ 440.180 and 440.181 of this subchapter and furnished as an alternative to NF care will not exceed the aggregate projected expenditure limit (APEL) defined in § 441.354.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State assurances.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Unless the Medicaid agency provides the following satisfactory assurances to CMS, CMS will not grant a waiver under this subpart and may terminate a waiver already granted.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Health and welfare.</E> The agency must assure that necessary safeguards have been taken to protect the health and welfare of the beneficiaries of services by assuring that the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) Adequate standards for all types of providers that furnish services under the waiver are met. (These standards must be reasonably related to the requirements of the waiver service to be furnished.)</P>
              <P>(2) The standards of any State licensure or certification requirements are met for services or for individuals furnishing services under the waiver.</P>
              <P>(3) All facilities covered by section 1616(e) of the Act, in which home and community-based services are furnished, are in compliance with applicable State standards that meet the requirements of 45 CFR part 1397 for board and care facilities.</P>
              <P>(4) Physician reviews of prescribed psychotropic drugs (when prescribed for purposes of behavior control of waiver beneficiaries) occur at least every 30 days.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Financial accountability.</E> The agency must assure financial accountability for funds expended for home and community-based services. The State <PRTPAGE P="400"/>must provide for an independent audit f its waiver program. The performance of a single financial audit, in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-502, enacted on October 19, 1984), is deemed to satisfy the requirement for an independent audit. The agency must maintain and make available to HHS, the Comptroller General, or other designees, appropriate financial records documenting the cost of services furnished to individuals age 65 or older under the waiver and the State plan, including reports of any independent audits conducted.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluation of need.</E> The agency must provide for an initial evaluation (and periodic reevaluations) of the need for the level of care furnished in a NF when there is a reasonable indication that individuals age 65 or older might need those services in the near future, but for the availability of home and community-based services. The procedures used to assess level of care for a potential waiver beneficiary must be at least as stringent as any existing State procedures applicable to individuals entering a NF. The qualifications of individuals performing the waiver assessment must be as high as those of individuals assessing the need for NF care, and the assessment instrument itself must be the same as any assessment instrument used to establish level of care of prospective inpatients in NFs. A periodic reevaluation of the level of care must be performed. The period of reevaluation of level of care cannot extend beyond 1 year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Expenditures.</E> The agency must assure that the total amount expended by the State for medical assistance with respect to NF, home health, private duty nursing, personal care services, home and community-based services furnished under a section 1915(c) waiver granted under Subpart G of this part to individuals age 65 or older, and the home and community-based services approved and furnished under a section 1915(d) waiver for individuals age 65 or older during a waiver year will not exceed the APEL, calculated in accordance with § 441.354.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> The agency must assure that it will provide CMS annually with information on the waiver's impact. The information must be consistent with a reasonable data collection plan designed by CMS and must address the waiver's impact on—</P>
              <P>(1) The type, amount, and cost of services furnished under the State plan; and</P>
              <P>(2) The health and welfare of beneficiaries of the services described in § 440.181 of this chapter.</P>

A copy of the forms or documentation used by the agency to verify that this choice has been offered and that beneficiaries of waiver services, or their legal representatives, have been given the free choice of the providers of both waiver and State plan services must also be available for CMS review. The Medicaid agency must provide an opportunity for a fair hearing, under 42 CFR part 431, subpart E, to beneficiaries who are not given the choice of home or community-based services as an alternative to institutional care in a NF or who are denied the service(s) or the providers of their choice.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Amendment of the APEL.</E> The State may request amendment of its APEL to reflect an increase in the aggregate amount of medical assistance for NF services and for services included in the calculation of the APEL as required by paragraph (c) of this section when the increase is directly attributable to legislation enacted on or after December 22, 1987, which amends title XIX of the Act. Costs attributable to laws enacted before December 22, 1987 will not be considered. Because the APEL for each year of the waiver is computed separately from the APEL for any other waiver year, a separate amendment must be submitted for each year in which the State chooses to raise its APEL. Documentation specific to the waiver year involved must be submitted to CMS.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Duration, extension, and amendment of a waiver.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Effective dates and extension periods.</E> (1) The effective date for a waiver of Medicaid requirements to furnish home and community-based services to individuals age 65 or older under this subpart is established by CMS prospectively on the first day of the FFY following the date on which the waiver is approved.</P>
              <P>(2) The initial waiver is approved for a 3-year period from the effective date. Subsequent renewals are approved for 5-year periods.</P>
              <P>(3) If the agency requests it, the waiver may be extended for an additional 5-year period if CMS's review of the prior period shows that the assurances required by § 441.352 were met.</P>

              <P>(4) The agency may request that waiver modifications be made effective retroactive to the first day of the waiver year in which the amendment is submitted, unless the amendment involves substantive change. Substantive changes may include, but are not limited to, addition of services under the waiver, a change in the qualifications of service providers, or a change in the eligible population.<PRTPAGE P="403"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) A request for an amendment that involves a substantive change is given a prospective effective date, but this date need not coincide with the start of the next FFY.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Extension or new waiver request.</E> CMS determines whether a request for extension of an existing waiver is actually an extension request, or a request for a new waiver. Generally, if a State's extension request proposes a substantive change in services furnished, eligible population, service area, statutory sections waived, or qualifications of service providers, CMS considers it a new waiver request.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reconsideration of denial.</E> A determination of CMS to deny a request for a waiver (or for extension of a waiver) under this subpart may be reconsidered in accordance with § 441.357.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Existing waiver effectiveness after denial.</E> If CMS denies a request for an extension of an existing waiver under this subpart:</P>
              <P>(1) The existing waiver remains in effect for a period of not less than 90 days after the date on which CMS denies the request, or, if the State seeks reconsideration in accordance with § 441.357, the date on which a final determination is made with respect to that review.</P>
              <P>(2) CMS calculates an APEL for the period for which the waiver remains in effect, and this calculation is used to pro-rate the limit according to the number of days to which it applies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Waiver termination.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Termination by the State.</E> If a State chooses to terminate its waiver before an approved program is due to expire, the following conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The State must notify CMS in writing at least 30 days before terminating services to beneficiaries.</P>
              <P>(2) The State must notify beneficiaries of services under the waiver at least 30 days before terminating services in accordance with § 431.210 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) CMS continues to apply the APEL described in § 441.354 through the end of the waiver year, but this limit is not applied in subsequent years.</P>
              <P>(4) The State may not decrease the services available under the approved State plan to individuals age 65 or older by an amount that violates the comparability of service requirements set forth in § 440.240 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Termination by CMS.</E> (1) If CMS finds, during an approved waiver period, that an agency is not meeting one or more of the requirements for a waiver contained in this subpart, CMS notifies the agency in writing of its findings and grants an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with § 441.357. If CMS determines that the agency is not in compliance with this subpart after the notice and any hearing, CMS may terminate the waiver.</P>
              <P>(2) If CMS terminates the waiver, the following conditions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The State must notify beneficiaries of services under the waiver at least 30 days before terminating services in accordance with § 431.210 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) CMS continues to apply the APEL in § 441.354 of this subpart, but the limit is prorated according to the number of days in the fiscal year during which waiver services were offered. The limit expires concurrently with the termination of home and community-based services under the waiver.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Periodic evaluation, assessment, and review.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section prescribes requirements for periodic evaluation, assessment, and review of the care and services furnished to individuals receiving home and community-based waiver services under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Evaluation and assessment review team.</E> (1) A review team, as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, must periodically evaluate and assess the care and services furnished to beneficiaries under this subpart. The review team must be created by the State agency directly, or (through interagency agreement) by other departments of State government (such as the Department of Health or the Agency on Aging).</P>
              <P>(2) Each review team must consist of at least one physician or registered nurse, and at least one other individual with health and social service credentials who the State believes is qualified to properly evaluate and assess the care and services provided under the waiver. If there is no physician on the review team, the Medicaid agency must ensure that a physician is available to provide consultation to the review team.</P>
              <P>(3) For waiver services furnished to individuals who have been found to be likely to require the level of care furnished in a NF that is also an IMD, each review team must have a psychiatrist or physician and other appropriate mental health or social service personnel who are knowledgeable about geriatric mental illness.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Financial interests and employment of review team members.</E> (1) No member of a review team may have a financial interest in or be employed by any entity that furnishes care and services under the waiver to a beneficiary whose care is under review.</P>
              <P>(2) No physician member of a review team may evaluate or assess the care of a beneficiary for whom he or she is the attending physician.</P>
              <P>(3) No individual who serves as case manager, caseworker, benefit authorizer, or any similar position, may serve as member of a review team that evaluates and assesses care furnished to a beneficiary with whom he or she has had a professional relationship.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Number and location of review teams.</E> A sufficient number of teams must be located within the State so that onsite inspections can be made at appropriate intervals at sites where waiver beneficiaries receive care and services.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Frequency of periodic evaluations and assessments.</E> Periodic evaluations and assessments must be conducted at least annually for each beneficiary under the waiver. The review team and the agency have the option to determine the frequency of further periodic evaluations and assessments, based on the quality of services and access to care being furnished under the waiver and the condition of patients receiving care and services.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification before inspection.</E> No provider of care and services under the waiver may be notified in advance of a periodic evaluation, assessment, and review. However, when a beneficiary receives services in his own home or the home of a relative, notification must be provided to the residents of <PRTPAGE P="405"/>the household at least 48 hours in advance. The beneficiary must have an opportunity to decline access to the home. If the beneficiary declines access to his or her own home, or the home of a relative, the review is limited solely to the review of the provider's records. If the beneficiary is incompetent, the head of the household has the authority to decline access to the home.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Personal contact with and observation of beneficiaries and review of records.</E> (1) For beneficiaries of care and services under a waiver, the review team's evaluation and assessment must include—</P>
              <P>(i) A review of each beneficiary's medical record, the evaluation and reevaluation required by § 441.353(c), and the plan of care under which the waiver and other services are furnished; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the records described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section are inadequate or incomplete, personal contact and observation of each beneficiary.</P>
              <P>(2) The review team may personally contact and observe any beneficiary whose care the team evaluates and assesses.</P>
              <P>(3) The review team may consult with both formal and informal caregivers when the beneficiary's records are inadequate or incomplete and when any apparent discrepancy exists between services required by the beneficiary and services furnished under the waiver.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Determinations by the review team.</E> The review team must determine in its evaluation and assessment whether—</P>
              <P>(1) The services included in the plan of care are adequate to meet the health and welfare needs of each beneficiary;</P>
              <P>(2) The services included in the plan of care have been furnished to the beneficiary as planned;</P>
              <P>(3) It is necessary and in the interest of the beneficiary to continue receiving services through the waiver program; and</P>
              <P>(4) It is feasible to meet the beneficiary's health and welfare needs through the waiver program.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Other information considered by review team.</E> When making determinations, under paragraph (h) of this section, for each beneficiary, the review team must consider the following information and may consider other information as it deems necessary:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether the medical record, the determination of level of care, and the plan of care are consistent, and whether all ordered services have been furnished and properly recorded.</P>
              <P>(2) Whether physician review of prescribed psychotropic medications (when required for behavior control) has occurred at least every 30 days.</P>
              <P>(3) Whether tests or observations of each beneficiary indicated by his or her medical record are made at appropriate times and properly recorded.</P>
              <P>(4) Whether progress notes entered in the record by formal and informal caregivers are made as required and appear to be consistent with the observed condition of the beneficiary.</P>
              <P>(5) Whether reevaluations of the beneficiary's level of care have occurred at least as frequently as would be required if that individual were served in a NF.</P>
              <P>(6) Whether the beneficiary receives adequate care and services, based, at a minimum, on the following when observations are necessary (the requirements for the necessity of observations are set forth in new § 441.365(g)(3)):</P>
              <P>(i) Cleanliness.</P>
              <P>(ii) Absence of bedsores.</P>
              <P>(iii) Absence of signs of malnutrition or dehydration.</P>
              <P>(7) Whether the beneficiary needs any service that is not included in the plan of care, or if included, is not being furnished by formal or informal caregivers under the waiver or through arrangements with another public or private source of assistance.</P>
              <P>(8) Determination as to whether continued home and community-based services are required by the beneficiary to avoid the likelihood of placement in a NF.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Submission of review team's results.</E> The review team must submit to the Medicaid agency the results of its periodic evaluation, assessment and review of the care of the beneficiary:</P>
              <P>(1) Within 1 month of the completion of the review.</P>

              <P>(2) Immediately upon its determination that conditions exist that may constitute a threat to the life or health of a beneficiary.<PRTPAGE P="406"/>
              </P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Agency's action.</E> The Medicaid agency must establish and adhere to procedures for taking appropriate action in response to the findings reported by the review team. These procedures must provide for immediate response to any finding that the life or health of a beneficiary may be jeopardized.</P>

              <P>(ii) The setting is selected by the individual from among setting options, including non-disability specific settings and an option for a private unit in a residential setting.

              <P>(B) Each individual has privacy in their sleeping or living unit:</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Identify a specific and individualized assessed need.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Document less intrusive methods of meeting the need that have been tried but did not work.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Include a clear description of the condition that is directly proportionate to the specific assessed need.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Include regulation collection and review of data to measure the ongoing effectiveness of the modification.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Include established time limits for periodic reviews to determine if the modification is still necessary or can be terminated.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Include the informed consent of the individual.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Include an assurance that interventions and supports will cause no harm to the individual.</P>
              <P>(2) Home and community-based settings do not include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A nursing facility;<PRTPAGE P="418"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) An institution for mental diseases;</P>
              <P>(iii) An intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities;</P>
              <P>(iv) A hospital providing long-term care services; or</P>
              <P>(v) Any other locations that have qualities of an institutional setting, as determined by the Secretary. Any setting that is located in a building that is also a publicly or privately operated facility that provides inpatient institutional treatment, or in a building on the grounds of, or immediately adjacent to, a public institution, or any other setting that has the effect of isolating individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS from the broader community of individuals not receiving Medicaid HCBS will be presumed to be a setting that has the qualities of an institution unless the Secretary determines through heightened scrutiny, based on information presented by the State or other parties, that the setting does not have the qualities of an institution and that the setting does have the qualities of home and community-based settings.</P>

              <P>(4) An Indian, as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Under the VFC program, vaccines must be administered by program-registered providers. Section 1928(c) of the Act defines a program-registered provider as any health care provider that meets the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Is licensed or authorized to administer pediatric vaccines under the law of the state in which the administration occurs without regard to whether or not the provider is a Medicaid-participating provider.</P>
              <P>(2) Submits to the state an executed provider agreement in the form and manner specified by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(3) Has not been found, by the Secretary or the state to have violated the provider agreement or other applicable requirements established by the Secretary or the state.</P>

              <P>(a) Under the VFC Program, a provider who administers a qualified pediatric vaccine to a federally vaccine-eligible child, may not impose a charge for the cost of the vaccine.</P>
              <P>(1) A provider can impose a fee for the administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine as long as the fee does not exceed the costs of the administration (as determined by the Secretary based on actual regional costs for the administration).</P>
              <P>(2) A provider may not deny administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine to a vaccine-eligible child due to the inability of the child's parents or legal guardian to pay the administration fee.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary must publish each State's regional maximum charge for the VFC program, which represents the maximum amount that a provider in a state could charge for the administration of qualified pediatric vaccines to federally vaccine-eligible children under the VFC program.</P>
              <P>(c) An interim formula has been established for the calculation of a state's regional maximum administration fee. That formula is as follows: National charge data × updated geographic adjustment factors (GAFs) = maximum VFC fee.</P>
              <P>(d) The State Medicaid Agency must submit a state plan amendment that identifies the amount that the state will pay providers for the administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine to a Medicaid-eligible child under the VFC program. The amount identified by the state cannot exceed the state's regional maximum administration fee.</P>

              <P>(e) Physicians participating in the VFC program can charge federally vaccine-eligible children who are not enrolled in Medicaid the maximum administration fee (if that fee reflects the provider's cost of administration) regardless of whether the state has established a lower administration fee under <PRTPAGE P="425"/>the Medicaid program. However, there would be no federal Medicaid matching funds available for the administration since these children are not eligible for Medicaid.</P>

              <P>Section 1915(i) of the Act permits States to offer one or more home and community-based services (HCBS) under their State Medicaid plans to qualified individuals with disabilities or individuals who are elderly. Those services are listed in § 440.182 of this chapter, and are described by the State, including any limitations of the services. This optional benefit is known as the State plan HCBS benefit. This subpart describes what a State Medicaid plan must provide when the State elects to include the optional benefit, and defines State responsibilities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State plan home and community-based services under section 1915(i)(1) of the Act.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Home and Community-Based Setting. States must make State plan HCBS available in a home and community-based setting consistent with both paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Home and community-based settings must have all of the following qualities, and such other qualities as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, based on the needs of the individual as indicated in their person-centered service plan:</P>
              <P>(i) The setting is integrated in and supports full access of individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS to the greater community, including opportunities to seek employment and work in competitive integrated settings, engage in community life, control personal resources, and receive services in the community, to the same degree of access as individuals not receiving Medicaid HCBS.</P>
              <P>(ii) The setting is selected by the individual from among setting options, including non-disability specific settings and an option for a private unit in a residential setting. The setting options are identified and documented in the person-centered service plan and are based on the individual's needs, preferences, and, for residential settings, resources available for room and board.</P>
              <P>(iii) Ensures an individual's rights of privacy, dignity and respect, and freedom from coercion and restraint.</P>
              <P>(iv) Optimizes, but does not regiment, individual initiative, autonomy, and independence in making life choices, including but not limited to, daily activities, physical environment, and with whom to interact.</P>
              <P>(v) Facilitates individual choice regarding services and supports, and who provides them.</P>
              <P>(vi) In a provider-owned or controlled residential setting, in addition to the above qualities at paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, the following additional conditions must be met:</P>
              <P>(A) The unit or dwelling is a specific physical place that can be owned, rented, or occupied under a legally enforceable agreement by the individual receiving services, and the individual has, at a minimum, the same responsibilities and protections from eviction that tenants have under the landlord/tenant law of the state, county, city, or other designated entity. For settings in which landlord tenant laws do not apply, the State must ensure that a lease, residency agreement or other form of written agreement will be in place for each HCBS participant and that the document provides protections that address eviction processes and appeals comparable to those provided under the jurisdiction's landlord tenant law;</P>

              <P>(B) Each individual has privacy in their sleeping or living unit:<PRTPAGE P="426"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Units have entrance doors lockable by the individual, with only appropriate staff having keys to doors;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Individuals sharing units have a choice of roommates in that setting; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Individuals have the freedom to furnish and decorate their sleeping or living units within the lease or other agreement.</P>
              <P>(C) Individuals have the freedom and support to control their own schedules and activities, and have access to food at any time;</P>
              <P>(D) Individuals are able to have visitors of their choosing at any time;</P>
              <P>(E) The setting is physically accessible to the individual; and</P>
              <P>(F) Any modification of the additional conditions, under paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section, must be supported by a specific assessed need and justified in the person-centered service plan. The following requirements must be documented in the person-centered service plan:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Identify a specific and individualized assessed need.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Document the positive interventions and supports used prior to any modifications to the person-centered service plan.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Document less intrusive methods of meeting the need that have been tried but did not work.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Include a clear description of the condition that is directly proportionate to the specific assessed need.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Include regular collection and review of data to measure the ongoing effectiveness of the modification.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Include established time limits for periodic reviews to determine if the modification is still necessary or can be terminated.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Include the informed consent of the individual.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Include an assurance that interventions and supports will cause no harm to the individual.</P>
              <P>(2) Home and community-based settings do not include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A nursing facility.</P>
              <P>(ii) An institution for mental diseases.</P>
              <P>(iii) An intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities.</P>
              <P>(iv) A hospital.</P>
              <P>(v) Any other locations that have qualities of an institutional setting, as determined by the Secretary. Any setting that is located in a building that is also a publicly or privately operated facility that provides inpatient institutional treatment, or in a building on the grounds of, or immediately adjacent to, a public institution, or any other setting that has the effect of isolating individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS from the broader community of individuals not receiving Medicaid HCBS will be presumed to be a setting that has the qualities of an institution unless the Secretary determines through heightened scrutiny, based on information presented by the State or other parties, that the setting does not have the qualities of an institution and that the setting does have the qualities of home and community-based settings.</P>
              <P>(3) Compliance and transition:</P>
              <P>(i) States submitting state plan amendments for new section 1915(i) of the Act benefits must provide assurances of compliance with the requirements of this section for home and community-based settings as of the effective date of the state plan amendment;</P>
              <P>(ii) CMS will require transition plans for existing section 1915(c) waivers and approved state plans providing home and community-based services under section 1915(i) to achieve compliance with this section, as follows:</P>

              <P>(A) For each approved section 1915(i) of the Act benefit subject to renewal or submitted for amendment within one year after the effective date of this regulation, the State must submit a transition plan at the time of the renewal or amendment request that sets forth the actions the State will take to bring the specific 1915(i) State plan benefit into compliance with this section. The approval will be contingent on the inclusion of the transition plan approved by CMS. The transition plan must include all elements required by the Secretary; and within one hundred and twenty days of the submission of the first renewal or amendment request the State must submit a transition plan detailing how the State will operate all section 1915(c) HCBS waivers <PRTPAGE P="427"/>and any section 1915(i) State plan benefit in accordance with this section. The transition plan must include all elements including timelines and deliverables as approved by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(B) For States that do not have a section 1915(c) waiver or a section 1915(i) State plan benefit due for renewal or proposed for amendments within one year of the effective date of this regulation, the State must submit a transition plan detailing how the State will operate all section 1915(c) waivers and any section 1915(i) State plan benefit in accordance with this section. This plan must be submitted no later than one year after the effective date of this regulation. The transition plan must include all elements including timelines and deliverables as approved by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(iii) A State must provide at least a 30-day public notice and comment period regarding the transition plan(s) that the State intends to submit to CMS for review and consideration, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The State must at a minimum provide two (2) statements of public notice and public input procedures.</P>
              <P>(B) The State must ensure the full transition plan(s) is available to the public for public comment.</P>
              <P>(C) The State must consider and modify the transition plan, as the State deems appropriate, to account for public comment.</P>
              <P>(iv) A State must submit to CMS, with the proposed transition plan:</P>
              <P>(A) Evidence of the public notice required.</P>
              <P>(B) A summary of the comments received during the public notice period, reasons why comments were not adopted, and any modifications to the transition plan based upon those comments.</P>
              <P>(v) Upon approval by CMS, the State will begin implementation of the transition plans. The State's failure to submit an approvable transition plan as required by this section and/or to comply with the terms of the approved transition plan may result in compliance actions, including but not limited to deferral/disallowance of Federal Financial Participation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Needs-Based Eligibility Requirement.</E> Meet needs-based criteria for eligibility for the State plan HCBS benefit, as required in § 441.715(a).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Minimum State plan HCBS Requirement.</E> Be assessed to require at least one section 1915(i) home and community-based service at a frequency determined by the State, as required in § 441.720(a)(5).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Target Population.</E> Meet any applicable targeting criteria defined by the State under the authority of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Nonapplication.</E> The State may elect in the State plan amendment approved under this subpart not to apply the following requirements when determining eligibility:</P>
              <P>(1) Section 1902(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Act, pertaining to income and resource eligibility rules for the medically needy living in the community, but only for the purposes of providing State plan HCBS.</P>
              <P>(2) Section 1902(a)(10)(B) of the Act, pertaining to comparability of Medicaid services, but only for the purposes of providing section 1915(i) State plan HCBS. In the event that a State elects not to apply comparability requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The State must describe the group(s) receiving State plan HCBS, subject to the Secretary's approval. Targeting criteria cannot have the impact of limiting the pool of qualified providers from which an individual would receive services, or have the impact of requiring an individual to receive services from the same entity from which they purchase their housing. These groups must be defined on the basis of any combination of the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Age.</P>
              <P>(B) Diagnosis.</P>
              <P>(C) Disability.</P>
              <P>(D) Medicaid Eligibility Group.</P>
              <P>(ii) The State may elect in the State plan amendment to limit the availability of specific services defined under the authority of § 440.182(c) of this chapter or to vary the amount, duration, or scope of those services, to one or more of the group(s) described in this paragraph.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 441.715</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Needs-based criteria and evaluation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Needs-based criteria.</E> The State must establish needs-based criteria for determining an individual's eligibility under the State plan for the HCBS benefit, and may establish needs-based criteria for each specific service. Needs-based criteria are factors used to determine an individual's requirements for support, and may include risk factors. The criteria are not characteristics that describe the individual or the individual's condition. A diagnosis is not a sufficient factor on which to base a determination of need. A criterion can be considered needs-based if it is a factor that can only be ascertained for a given person through an individualized evaluation of need.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">More stringent institutional and waiver needs-based criteria.</E> The State plan HCBS benefit is available only if the State has in effect needs-based criteria (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section), for receipt of services in nursing facilities as defined in section 1919(a) of the Act, intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities as defined in § 440.150 of this chapter, and hospitals as defined in § 440.10 of this chapter for which the State has established long-term level of care (LOC) criteria, or waivers offering HCBS, and these needs-based criteria are more stringent than the needs-based criteria for the State plan HCBS benefit. If the State defines needs-based criteria for individual State plan home and community-based services, it may not have the effect of limiting who can benefit from the State plan HCBS in an unreasonable way, as determined by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(1) These more stringent criteria must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Be included in the LOC determination process for each institutional service and waiver.</P>
              <P>(ii) Be submitted for inspection by CMS with the State plan amendment that establishes the State Plan HCBS benefit.</P>
              <P>(iii) Be in effect on or before the effective date of the State plan HCBS benefit.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that the State modifies institutional LOC criteria to meet the requirements under paragraph (b) or (c)(6) of this section that such criteria be more stringent than the State plan HCBS needs-based eligibility criteria, States may continue to receive FFP for individuals receiving institutional services or waiver HCBS under the LOC criteria previously in effect.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustment authority.</E> The State may modify the needs-based criteria established under paragraph (a) of this section, without prior approval from the Secretary, if the number of individuals enrolled in the State plan HCBS benefit exceeds the projected number submitted annually to CMS. The Secretary may approve a retroactive effective date for the State plan amendment modifying the criteria, as early as the day following the notification period required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The State provides at least 60 days notice of the proposed modification to the Secretary, the public, and each individual enrolled in the State plan HCBS benefit.</P>
              <P>(2) The State notice to the Secretary is submitted as an amendment to the State plan.</P>
              <P>(3) The adjusted needs-based eligibility criteria for the State plan HCBS benefit are less stringent than needs-based institutional and waiver LOC criteria in effect after the adjustment.</P>
              <P>(4) Individuals who were found eligible for the State plan HCBS benefit before modification of the needs-based criteria under this adjustment authority must remain eligible for the HCBS benefit until such time as:</P>
              <P>(i) The individual no longer meets the needs-based criteria used for the initial determination of eligibility; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The individual is no longer eligible for or enrolled in Medicaid or the HCBS benefit.</P>
              <P>(5) Any changes in service due to the modification of needs-based criteria under this adjustment authority are treated as actions as defined in § 431.201 of this chapter and are subject to the requirements of part 431, subpart E of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(6) In the event that the State also needs to modify institutional level of care criteria to meet the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section that such criteria be more stringent than <PRTPAGE P="429"/>the State plan HCBS needs-based eligibility criteria, the State may adjust the modified institutional LOC criteria under this adjustment authority. The adjusted institutional LOC criteria must be at least as stringent as those in effect before they were modified to meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Independent evaluation and determination of eligibility.</E> Eligibility for the State plan HCBS benefit must be determined through an independent evaluation of each individual according to the requirements of this subpart. The independent evaluation complies with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Is performed by an agent that is independent and qualified as defined in § 441.730.</P>
              <P>(2) Applies the needs-based eligibility criteria that the State has established under paragraph (a) of this section, and the general eligibility requirements under §§ 435.219 and 436.219 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) Includes consultation with the individual, and if applicable, the individual's representative as defined under § 441.735.</P>
              <P>(4) Assesses the individual's support needs.</P>
              <P>(5) Uses only current and accurate information from existing records, and obtains any additional information necessary to draw valid conclusions about the individual's support needs.</P>
              <P>(6) Evaluations finding that an individual is not eligible for the State plan HCBS benefit are treated as actions defined in § 431.201 of this chapter and are subject to the requirements of part 431 subpart E of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Periodic redetermination.</E> Independent reevaluations of each individual receiving the State plan HCBS benefit must be performed at least every 12 months, to determine whether the individual continues to meet eligibility requirements. Redeterminations must meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Independent assessment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> For each individual determined to be eligible for the State plan HCBS benefit, the State must provide for an independent assessment of needs, which may include the results of a standardized functional needs assessment, in order to establish a service plan. In applying the requirements of section 1915(i)(1)(F) of the Act, the State must:</P>
              <P>(1) Perform a face-to-face assessment of the individual by an agent who is independent and qualified as defined in § 441.730, and with a person-centered process that meets the requirements of § 441.725(a) and is guided by best practice and research on effective strategies that result in improved health and quality of life outcomes.</P>
              <P>(i) For the purposes of this section, a face-to-face assessment may include assessments performed by telemedicine, or other information technology medium, if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(A) The agent performing the assessment is independent and qualified as defined in § 441.730 and meets the provider qualifications defined by the State, including any additional qualifications or training requirements for the operation of required information technology.</P>
              <P>(B) The individual receives appropriate support during the assessment, including the use of any necessary on-site support-staff.</P>
              <P>(C) The individual provides informed consent for this type of assessment.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(2) Conduct the assessment in consultation with the individual, and if applicable, the individual's authorized representative, and include the opportunity for the individual to identify other persons to be consulted, such as, but not limited to, the individual's spouse, family, guardian, and treating and consulting health and support professionals responsible for the individual's care.</P>
              <P>(3) Examine the individual's relevant history including the findings from the independent evaluation of eligibility, medical records, an objective evaluation of functional ability, and any other records or information needed to develop the person-centered service plan as required in § 441.725.</P>

              <P>(4) Include in the assessment the individual's physical, cognitive, and behavioral health care and support needs, strengths and preferences, available <PRTPAGE P="430"/>service and housing options, and if unpaid caregivers will be relied upon to implement any elements of the person-centered service plan, a caregiver assessment.</P>
              <P>(5) For each service, apply the State's additional needs-based criteria (if any) that the individual may require. Individuals are considered enrolled in the State plan HCBS benefit only if they meet the eligibility and needs-based criteria for the benefit, and are also assessed to require and receive at least one home and community-based service offered under the State plan for medical assistance.</P>
              <P>(6) Include in the assessment, if the State offers individuals the option to self-direct a State plan home and community-based service or services, any information needed for the self-directed portion of the service plan, as required in § 441.740(b), including the ability of the individual (with and without supports) to exercise budget or employer authority.</P>
              <P>(7) Include in the assessment, for individuals receiving habilitation services, documentation that no Medicaid services are provided which would otherwise be available to the individual, specifically including but not limited to services available to the individual through a program funded under section 110 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Person-centered service plan.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Person-centered planning process.</E> Based on the independent assessment required in § 441.720, the State must develop (or approve, if the plan is developed by others) a written service plan jointly with the individual (including, for purposes of this paragraph, the individual and the individual's authorized representative if applicable). The person-centered planning process is driven by the individual. The process:</P>
              <P>(1) Includes people chosen by the individual.</P>
              <P>(2) Provides necessary information and support to ensure that the individual directs the process to the maximum extent possible, and is enabled to make informed choices and decisions.</P>
              <P>(3) Is timely and occurs at times and locations of convenience to the individual.</P>
              <P>(4) Reflects cultural considerations of the individual and is conducted by providing information in plain language and in a manner that is accessible to individuals with disabilities and persons who are limited English proficient, consistent with § 435.905(b) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(5) Includes strategies for solving conflict or disagreement within the process, including clear conflict of interest guidelines for all planning participants.</P>
              <P>(6) Offers choices to the individual regarding the services and supports the individual receives and from whom.</P>
              <P>(7) Includes a method for the individual to request updates to the plan, as needed.</P>
              <P>(8) Records the alternative home and community-based settings that were considered by the individual.</P>

              <P>(b) The person-centered service plan. The person-centered service plan must reflect the services and supports that are important for the individual to meet the needs identified through an assessment of functional need, as well as what is important to the individual <PRTPAGE P="431"/>with regard to preferences for the delivery of such services and supports. Commensurate with the level of need of the individual, and the scope of services and supports available under the State plan HCBS benefit, the written plan must:</P>
              <P>(1) Reflect that the setting in which the individual resides is chosen by the individual. The State must ensure that the setting chosen by the individual is integrated in, and supports full access of individuals receiving Medicaid HCBS to the greater community, including opportunities to seek employment and work in competitive integrated settings, engage in community life, control personal resources, and receive services in the community to the same degree of access as individuals not receiving Medicaid HCBS.</P>
              <P>(2) Reflect the individual's strengths and preferences.</P>
              <P>(3) Reflect clinical and support needs as identified through an assessment of functional need.</P>
              <P>(4) Include individually identified goals and desired outcomes.</P>
              <P>(5) Reflect the services and supports (paid and unpaid) that will assist the individual to achieve identified goals, and the providers of those services and supports, including natural supports. Natural supports are unpaid supports that are provided voluntarily to the individual in lieu of State plan HCBS.</P>
              <P>(6) Reflect risk factors and measures in place to minimize them, including individualized backup plans and strategies when needed.</P>
              <P>(7) Be understandable to the individual receiving services and supports, and the individuals important in supporting him or her. At a minimum, for the written plan to be understandable, it must be written in plain language and in a manner that is accessible to individuals with disabilities and persons who are limited English proficient, consistent with § 435.905(b) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(8) Identify the individual and/or entity responsible for monitoring the plan.</P>
              <P>(9) Be finalized and agreed to, with the informed consent of the individual in writing, and signed by all individuals and providers responsible for its implementation.</P>
              <P>(10) Be distributed to the individual and other people involved in the plan.</P>
              <P>(11) Include those services, the purchase or control of which the individual elects to self-direct, meeting the requirements of § 441.740.</P>
              <P>(12) Prevent the provision of unnecessary or inappropriate services and supports.</P>
              <P>(13) Document that any modification of the additional conditions, under § 441.710(a)(1)(vi)(A) through (D) of this chapter, must be supported by a specific assessed need and justified in the person-centered service plan. The following requirements must be documented in the person-centered service plan:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify a specific and individualized assessed need.</P>
              <P>(ii) Document the positive interventions and supports used prior to any modifications to the person-centered service plan.</P>
              <P>(iii) Document less intrusive methods of meeting the need that have been tried but did not work.</P>
              <P>(iv) Include a clear description of the condition that is directly proportionate to the specific assessed need.</P>
              <P>(v) Include a regular collection and review of data to measure the ongoing effectiveness of the modification.</P>
              <P>(vi) Include established time limits for periodic reviews to determine if the modification is still necessary or can be terminated.</P>
              <P>(vii) Include informed consent of the individual; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Include an assurance that the interventions and supports will cause no harm to the individual.</P>
              <P>(c) Reviewing the person-centered service plan. The person-centered service plan must be reviewed, and revised upon reassessment of functional need as required in § 441.720, at least every 12 months, when the individual's circumstances or needs change significantly, and at the request of the individual.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The State must provide assurances that necessary safeguards have been taken to protect the health and welfare of enrollees in State plan HCBS, and must define in writing standards for providers (both agencies <PRTPAGE P="432"/>and individuals) of HCBS and for agents conducting individualized independent evaluation, independent assessment, and service plan development.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Conflict of interest standards.</E> The State must define conflict of interest standards that ensure the independence of individual and agency agents who conduct (whether as a service or an administrative activity) the independent evaluation of eligibility for State plan HCBS, who are responsible for the independent assessment of need for HCBS, or who are responsible for the development of the service plan. The conflict of interest standards apply to all individuals and entities, public or private. At a minimum, these agents must not be any of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Related by blood or marriage to the individual, or to any paid caregiver of the individual.</P>
              <P>(2) Financially responsible for the individual.</P>
              <P>(3) Empowered to make financial or health-related decisions on behalf of the individual.</P>

              <P>(5) Providers of State plan HCBS for the individual, or those who have an interest in or are employed by a provider of State plan HCBS for the individual, except when the State demonstrates that the only willing and qualified agent to perform independent assessments and develop person-centered service plans in a geographic area also provides HCBS, and the State devises conflict of interest protections including separation of agent and provider functions within provider entities, which are described in the State plan for medical assistance and approved by the Secretary, and individuals are provided with a clear and accessible alternative dispute resolution process.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Training.</E> Qualifications for agents performing independent assessments and plans of care must include training in assessment of individuals whose physical, cognitive, or mental conditions trigger a potential need for home and community-based services and supports, and current knowledge of available resources, service options, providers, and best practices to improve health and quality of life outcomes.</P>

              <P>In this subpart, the term <E T="03">individual's representative</E> means, with respect to an individual being evaluated for, assessed regarding, or receiving State plan HCBS, the following:</P>
              <P>(a) The individual's legal guardian or other person who is authorized under State law to represent the individual for the purpose of making decisions related to the person's care or well-being. In instances where state law confers decision-making authority to the individual representative, the individual will lead the service planning process to the extent possible.</P>
              <P>(b) Any other person who is authorized under § 435.923 of this chapter, or under the policy of the State Medicaid Agency to represent the individual, including but not limited to, a parent, a family member, or an advocate for the individual.</P>
              <P>(c) When the State authorizes representatives in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the State must have policies describing the process for authorization; the extent of decision-making authorized; and safeguards to ensure that the representative uses substituted judgment on behalf of the individual. State policies must address exceptions to using substituted judgment when the individual's wishes cannot be ascertained or when the individual's wishes would result in substantial harm to the individual. States may not refuse the authorized representative that the individual chooses, unless in the process of applying the requirements for authorization, the State discovers and can document evidence that the representative is not acting in accordance with these policies or cannot perform the required functions. States must continue to meet the requirements regarding the person-centered planning process at § 441.725 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Self-directed services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">State option.</E> The State may choose to offer an election for self-directing HCBS. The term “self-directed” means, with respect to State plan HCBS listed in § 440.182 of this chapter, services that are planned and purchased under the direction and control of the individual, including the amount, duration, scope, provider, and location of the HCBS.

              <P>(4) Describe the process for facilitating voluntary and involuntary transition from self-direction including any circumstances under which transition out of self-direction is involuntary. There must be state procedures to ensure the continuity of services during the transition from self-direction to other service delivery methods.</P>
              <P>(5) Specify the financial management supports, as required in paragraph (e) of this section, to be provided.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Employer authority.</E> If the person-centered service plan includes authority to select, manage, or dismiss providers of the State plan HCBS, the person-centered service plan must specify the authority to be exercised by the individual, any limits to the authority, and specify parties responsible for functions outside the authority the individual exercises.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Budget authority.</E> If the person-centered service plan includes an individualized budget (which identifies the dollar value of the services and supports under the control and direction of the individual), the person-centered service plan must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Describe the method for calculating the dollar values in the budget, based on reliable costs and service utilization.</P>
              <P>(2) Define a process for making adjustments in dollar values to reflect changes in an individual's assessment and service plan.</P>
              <P>(3) Provide a procedure to evaluate expenditures under the budget.</P>

              <P>(1) Information and assistance consistent with sound principles and practice of self-direction.</P>
              <P>(2) Financial management supports to meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Manage Federal, State, and local employment tax, labor, worker's compensation, insurance, and other requirements that apply when the individual functions as the employer of service providers.</P>
              <P>(ii) Make financial transactions on behalf of the individual when the individual has personal budget authority.</P>
              <P>(iii) Maintain separate accounts for each individual's budget and provide periodic reports of expenditures against budget in a manner understandable to the individual.</P>
              <P>(3) Voluntary training on how to select, manage, and dismiss providers of State plan HCBS.</P>

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Number served.</E> The State will annually provide CMS with the projected number of individuals to be enrolled in the benefit and the actual number of unduplicated individuals enrolled in State plan HCBS in the previous year.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Access to services.</E> The State must grant access to all State plan HCBS assessed to be needed in accordance with a service plan consistent with § 441.725, to individuals who have been determined to be eligible for the State plan HCBS benefit, subject to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(A) A State must determine that provided services meet medical necessity criteria.</P>
              <P>(B) A State may limit access to services through targeting criteria established by § 441.710(e)(2).</P>
              <P>(C) A State may not limit access to services based upon the income of eligible individuals, the cost of services, or the individual's location in the State.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A State must provide individuals with advance notice of and the right to appeal terminations, suspensions, or reductions of Medicaid eligibility or covered services as described in part 431, subpart E.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Administration</E>—(i) <E T="03">Option for presumptive payment.</E> (A) The State may provide for a period of presumptive payment, not to exceed 60 days, for Medicaid eligible individuals the State has reason to believe may be eligible for the State plan HCBS benefit. FFP is available for both services that meet the definition of medical assistance and necessary administrative expenditures for evaluation of eligibility for the State plan HCBS benefit under § 441.715(d) and assessment of need for specific HCBS under § 441.720(a), prior to an individual's receipt of State plan HCBS or determination of ineligibility for the benefit.</P>
              <P>(B) If an individual the State has reason to believe may be eligible for the State plan HCBS benefit is evaluated and assessed under the presumptive payment option and found not to be eligible for the benefit, FFP is available for services that meet the definition of medical assistance and necessary administrative expenditures. The individual so determined will not be considered to have enrolled in the State plan HCBS benefit for purposes of determining the annual number of participants in the benefit.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Option for phase-in of services and eligibility.</E> (A) In the event that a State elects to establish targeting criteria through § 441.710(e)(2), the State may limit the enrollment of individuals or the provision services to enrolled individuals based upon criteria described in a phase-in plan, subject to CMS approval. A State which elects to target the State plan HCBS benefit and to phase-in enrollment and/or services must submit a phase-in plan for approval by CMS that describes, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The criteria used to limit enrollment or service delivery.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The rationale for phasing-in services and/or eligibility.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Timelines and benchmarks to ensure that the benefit is available statewide to all eligible individuals within the initial 5-year approval.</P>
              <P>(B) If a State elects to phase-in the enrollment of individuals based on highest need, the phase-in plan must use the needs-based criteria described in § 441.715(a) to establish priority for enrollment. Such criteria must be based upon the assessed need of individuals, with higher-need individuals receiving services prior to individuals with lower assessed need.</P>
              <P>(C) If a State elects to phase-in the provision of any services, the phase-in plan must include a description of the services that will not be available to all eligible individuals, the rationale for limiting the provision of services, and assurance that all individuals with access to a willing and qualified provider may receive services.</P>
              <P>(D) The plan may not include a cap on the number of enrollees.</P>
              <P>(E) The plan must include a timeline to assure that all eligible individuals receive all included services prior to the end of the first 5-year approval period, described in paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Reimbursement methodology.</E> The State plan amendment to provide State plan HCBS must contain a description of the reimbursement methodology for each covered service, in accordance with CMS sub-regulatory guidance. To <PRTPAGE P="435"/>the extent that the reimbursement methodologies for any self-directed services differ from those descriptions, the method for setting reimbursement methodology for the self-directed services must also be described.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Operation.</E> The State plan amendment to provide State plan HCBS must contain a description of the State Medicaid agency line of authority for operating the State plan HCBS benefit, including distribution of functions to other entities.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Modifications.</E> The agency may request that modifications to the benefit be made effective retroactive to the first day of a fiscal year quarter, or another date after the first day of a fiscal year quarter, in which the amendment is submitted, unless the amendment involves substantive change. Substantive changes may include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Revisions to services available under the benefit including elimination or reduction in services, and changes in the scope, amount and duration of the services.</P>
              <P>(B) Changes in the qualifications of service providers, rate methodology, or the eligible population.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Request for Amendments.</E> A request for an amendment that involves a substantive change as determined by CMS—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) May only take effect on or after the date when the amendment is approved by CMS; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Must be accompanied by information on how the State will ensure for transitions with minimal adverse impact on individuals impacted by the change.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Periods of approval.</E> (A) If a State elects to establish targeting criteria through § 441.710(e)(2)(i), the approval of the State Plan Amendment will be in effect for a period of 5 years from the effective date of the amendment. To renew State plan HCBS for an additional 5-year period, the State must provide a written request for renewal to CMS at least 180 days prior to the end of the approval period. CMS approval of a renewal request is contingent upon State adherence to Federal requirements and the state meeting its objectives with respect to quality improvement and beneficiary outcomes.</P>
              <P>(B) If a State does not elect to establish targeting criteria through § 441.710(e)(2)(i), the limitations on length of approval does not apply.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality improvement strategy: Program performance and quality of care.</E> States must develop and implement an HCBS quality improvement strategy that includes a continuous improvement process and measures of program performance and experience of care. The strategy must be proportionate to the scope of services in the State plan HCBS benefit and the number of individuals to be served. The State will make this information available to CMS at a frequency determined by the Secretary or upon request.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Quality Improvement Strategy.</E> The quality improvement strategy must include all of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Incorporate a continuous quality improvement process that includes monitoring, remediation, and quality improvement.</P>
              <P>(ii) Be evidence-based, and include outcome measures for program performance, quality of care, and individual experience as determined by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide evidence of the establishment of sufficient infrastructure to implement the program effectively.</P>
              <P>(iv) Measure individual outcomes associated with the receipt of HCBS, related to the implementation of goals included in the individual service plan.</P>

              <P>(a) Under §§ 440.40(a) and 440.150 of this chapter, FFP is available in expenditures for NF and ICF/IID services only if the facility has been certified as meeting the requirements for Medicaid <PRTPAGE P="438"/>participation, as evidenced by a provider agreement executed under this part. An agreement is not valid evidence that a facility has met those requirements if CMS determines that—</P>
              <P>(1) The survey agency failed to apply the applicable requirements under subpart B of part 483 of this chapter for NFs or subpart I of part 483 of this chapter, which set forth the conditions of participation for ICFs/IID.</P>
              <P>(2) The survey agency failed to follow the rules and procedures for certification set forth in subpart C of this part, subpart E of part 488, and § 431.610 of this subchapter;</P>
              <P>(3) The survey agency failed to perform any of the functions specified in § 431.610(g) of this subchapter relating to evaluating and acting on information about the facility and inspecting the facility;</P>
              <P>(4) The agency failed to use the Federal standards, and the forms, methods and procedures prescribed by CMS as required under § 431.610(f)(1) or § 488.318(b) of this chapter, for determining the qualifications of providers; or</P>
              <P>(5) The survey agency failed to adhere to the following principles in determining compliance:</P>
              <P>(i) The survey process is the means to assess compliance with Federal health, safety and quality standards;</P>
              <P>(ii) The survey process uses resident outcomes as the primary means to establish the compliance status of facilities. Specifically, surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and services to residents, and the effects of that care, to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of individual residents;</P>
              <P>(iii) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert with Federal forms and procedures, to determine compliance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform and consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;</P>
              <P>(v) Federal forms are used by all surveyors to ensure proper recording of findings and to document the basis for the findings.</P>
              <P>(6) The survey agency failed to assess in a systematic manner a facility's actual provision of care and services to residents and effects of that care on residents.</P>
              <P>(7) Required elements of the NF survey process fails to include all of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) An entrance conference;</P>
              <P>(ii) A resident-centered tour of facility;</P>
              <P>(iii) An in-depth review of a sample of residents including observation, interview and record review;</P>
              <P>(iv) Observation of the preparation and administration of drugs for a sample of residents;</P>
              <P>(v) Evaluation of a facility's meals, dining areas and eating assistance procedures;</P>
              <P>(vi) Formulation of a deficiency statement based on the incorporation of all appropriate findings onto the survey report form;</P>
              <P>(vii) An exit conference; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Follow-up surveys as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(8) The agreement's terms and conditions do not meet the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator will make the determination under paragraph (a) of this section through onsite surveys, other Federal reviews, State certification records, or reports he may require from the Medicaid or survey agency.</P>
              <P>(c) If the Administrator disallows a State's claim for FFP because of a determination under paragraph (a) of this section, the State is entitled upon request to reconsideration of the disallowance under 45 CFR part 16.</P>

                <E T="03">Effective date of expiration</E> means the date of expiration originally specified in the provider agreement, or the later date specified if the agreement is extended under § 442.16; and</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Effective date of termination</E> means a date earlier than the expiration date, set by the Medicaid agency when continuing participation until the expiration date is not justified, because the <PRTPAGE P="439"/>facility no longer meets the requirements for participation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope, applicability, and effective date</E>—(1) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section sets forth the extent of FFP in State Medicaid payments to an ICF/IID after its provider agreement has been terminated or has expired and not been renewed.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (i) This section and § 442.42 apply only when the Medicaid agency, of its own volition, terminates or does not a renew a provider agreement, and only when the survey agency certifies that there is no jeopardy to beneficiary health and safety. When the survey agency certifies that there is jeopardy to beneficiary health and safety, or when it fails to certify that there is no jeopardy, FFP ends on the effective date of termination or expiration.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the State acts under instructions from CMS, FFP ends on the date specified by CMS (CMS instructs the State to terminate the Medicaid provider agreement when CMS in validating a State survey agency certification, determines that an ICF/IID does not meet the requirements for participation.)</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> This section and § 442.42 apply to terminations or expirations that are effective on or after September 28, 1987. For terminations or nonrenewals that were effective before that date, FFP may continue for up to 120 days from September 28, 1987, or 12 months from the effective date of termination or nonrenewal, whichever is earlier.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Basic rules.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, FFP in payments to an ICF/IID ends on the effective date of termination of the facility's provider agreement, or if the agreement is not terminated, on the effective date of expiration.</P>
              <P>(2) If State law, or a Federal or State court order or injunction, requires the agency to extend the provider agreement or continue payments to a facility after the dates specified in paragraph (d) of this section, FFP is not available in those payments.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exception: Continuation of FFP after termination or expiration of provider agreement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Conditions for continuation.</E> FFP is available after the effective date of termination or expiration only if—</P>
              <P>(i) The evidentiary hearing required under § 431.153 of this chapter is provided by the State agency after the effective date of termination or expiration (or, if begun before termination or expiration, is not completed until after that date); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Termination or nonrenewal action is based on a survey agency certification that there is no jeopardy to beneficiaries' health and safety.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Extent of continuation.</E> FFP is available only through the earlier of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The date of issuance of an administrative hearing decision that upholds the agency's termination or nonrenewal action.</P>
              <P>(ii) The 120th day after the effective date of termination of the facility's provider agreement or, if the agreement is not terminated, the 120th day after the effective date of expiration. (If a hearing decision that upholds the facility is issued after the end of the 120-day period, when FFP has already been discontinued, the rules of § 442.42 on retroactive agreements apply).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Applicability of § 441.11.</E> If FFP is continued during appeal under paragraph (d) of this section, the 30-day period provided by § 441.11 of this chapter would not begin to run until issuance of a hearing decision that upholds the agency's termination or nonrenewal action.</P>

              <P>A State plan must provide that the Medicaid agency must limit participation in the Medicaid program to providers who accept, as payment in full, the amounts paid by the agency plus any deductible, coinsurance or copayment required by the plan to be paid by the individual.

              <SUBJECT>Withholding the Federal share of payments to Medicaid providers to recover Medicare overpayments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis and purpose.</E> This section implements section 1914 of the Act, which provides for withholding the Federal share of Medicaid payments to a provider if the provider has not arranged to repay Medicare overpayments or has failed to provide information to determine the amount of the overpayments. The intent of the statute and regulations is to facilitate the recovery of Medicare overpayments. The provision enables recovery of overpayments when institutions have reduced participation in Medicare or when physicians and suppliers have submitted few or no claims under Medicare, thus not receiving enough in Medicare reimbursement to permit offset of the overpayment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When withholding occurs.</E> The Federal share of Medicaid payments may be withheld from any provider specified in paragraph (c) of this section to recover Medicare overpayments that CMS has been unable to collect if the provider participates in Medicaid and—</P>
              <P>(1) The provider has not made arrangements satisfactory to CMS to repay the Medicare overpayment; or</P>
              <P>(2) CMS has been unable to collect information from the provider to determine the existence or amount of Medicare overpayment.</P>
              <P>(c) The Federal share of Medicaid payments may be withheld with respect to the following providers:</P>
              <P>(1) An institutional provider that has or previously had in effect a Medicare provider agreement under section 1866 of the Act; and</P>
              <P>(2) A Medicaid provider who has previously accepted Medicare payment on the basis of an assignment under section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act; and during the 12 month period preceding the quarter in which the Federal share is to be withheld for a Medicare overpayment, submitted no claims under Medicare or submitted claims which total less than the amount of overpayment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Order to reduce State payment.</E> (1) CMS may, at its discretion, issue an order to the Medicaid agency of any State that is using the provider's services, to reduce its payment to the provider by the amount specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The order to reduce payment to the provider will remain in effect until—</P>
              <P>(i) The Medicaid agency determines that the overpayment has been completely recovered; or</P>
              <P>(ii) CMS terminates the order.</P>
              <P>(3) CMS may withhold FFP from any State that does not comply with the order specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to reduce payment to the provider and claims FFP for the expenditure on its quarterly expenditure report.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of withholding.</E> (1) Before the Federal share of payments may be withheld under this section, CMS will notify the provider and the Medicaid agency of each State that CMS believes may use the overpaid provider's services under Medicaid.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice will include the instruction to reduce State payments, as provided under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) CMS will send the notice referred to in paragraph (e)(1) by certified mail, return receipt requested.</P>
              <P>(4) Each Medicaid agency must identify the amount of payment due the provider under Medicaid and give that information to CMS in the next quarterly expenditure report.</P>
              <P>(5) The Medicaid agency may appeal any disallowance of FFP resulting from the withholding decision to the Grant Appeals Board, in accordance with 45 CFR part 16.</P>

              <P>(f) Amount to be withheld. CMS may require the Medicaid agency to reduce the Federal share of its payment to the provider by the lesser of the following amounts.<PRTPAGE P="447"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The Federal matching share of payments to the provider, or</P>
              <P>(2) The total Medicare overpayment to the provider.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Effective date of withholding.</E> Withholding of payment will become effective no less than 60 days after the day on which the agency receives notice of withholding.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Duration of withholding.</E> No Federal funds are available in expenditures for services that are furnished by a provider specified in paragraph (c) of this section from the date on which the withholding becomes effective until the termination of withholding under paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Termination of withholding.</E> (1) CMS will terminate the order to reduce State payment if it determines that any of the following has occurred:</P>
              <P>(i) The Medicare overpayment is completely recovered:</P>
              <P>(ii) The institution or person makes an agreement satisfactory to CMS to repay the overpayment; or</P>
              <P>(iii) CMS determines that there is no overpayment based on newly acquired evidence or a subsequent audit.</P>
              <P>(2) CMS will notify each State that previously received a notice ordering the withholding that the withholding has been terminated.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Procedures for restoring excess withholding.</E> If an amount ultimately determined to be in excess of the Medicare overpayment is withheld, CMS will restore any excess funds withheld.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Recovery of funds from Medicaid agency.</E> A provider is not entitled to recover from the Medicaid agency the amount of payment withheld by the agency in accordance with a CMS order issued under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency notice to providers.</E> (1) Before the agency requests recovery of a Medicaid overpayment through Medicare, the agency must send either or both of the following notices, in addition to that required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, to the provider.</P>
              <P>(i) Notice that—</P>
              <P>(A) There has been an overpayment;</P>
              <P>(B) Repayment is required; and</P>
              <P>(C) The overpayment determination is subject to agency appeal procedures, but we may withhold Medicare payments while an appeal is in progress.</P>

                <P>(c) Prior to submitting to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for approval a state plan amendment (SPA) to establish or substantially modify existing premiums or cost sharing, or change the consequences for non-payment, the agency must provide the public with advance notice of the SPA, specifying the amount of premiums or cost sharing and who is subject to the charges. The agency must provide a reasonable opportunity to comment on such SPAs. The agency must submit documentation with the SPA to demonstrate that these requirements were met. If premiums or cost sharing is substantially modified during the SPA approval process, the agency must provide additional public notice.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Options for claiming FFP payment for section 1920A presumptive eligibility medical assistance payments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The FMAP rate for medical assistance payments made available to a child during a presumptive eligibility period under section 1920A of the Act is the regular FMAP under title XIX, based on the category of medical assistance; that is, the enhanced FMAP is not available for section 1920A presumptive eligibility expenditures.</P>
                <P>(b) States have the following 3 options for identifying Medicaid section 1920A presumptive eligibility expenditures and the application of payments for those expenditures:</P>
                <P>(1) A State may identify Medicaid section 1920A presumptive eligibility expenditures in the quarter expended with no further adjustment based on the results of a subsequent actual eligibility determination (if any).</P>

                <P>(2) A State may identify Medicaid section 1920A presumptive eligibility expenditures in the quarter expended but may adjust reported expenditures based on results of the actual eligibility determination (if any) to reflect the actual eligibility status of the individual, if other than presumptively eligible.<PRTPAGE P="458"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) A State may elect to delay submission of claims for payments of section 1920A presumptive eligibility expenditures until after the actual eligibility determination (if any) is made and, at that time identify such expenditures based on the actual eligibility status of individuals if other than presumptively eligible. At that time, the State would, as appropriate, recategorize the medical assistance expenditures made during the section 1920A presumptive eligibility period based on the results of the actual eligibility determination, and claim them appropriately.</P>

              <P>(a) The agency must maintain documentation of payment rates and make it available to HHS upon request.</P>
              <P>(b) In consultation with the medical care advisory committee under § 431.12 of this chapter, the agency must develop a medical assistance access monitoring review plan and update it, in accordance with the timeline established in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The plan must be published and made available to the public for review and comment for a period of no less than 30 days, prior to being finalized and submitted to CMS for review.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Access monitoring review plan data requirements.</E> The access monitoring review plan must include an access monitoring analysis that includes: Data sources, methodologies, baselines, assumptions, trends and factors, and thresholds that analyze and inform determinations of the sufficiency of access to care which may vary by geographic location within the state and will be used to inform state policies affecting access to Medicaid services such as provider payment rates, as well as the items specified in this section.

The plan and monitoring analysis will consider:<PRTPAGE P="459"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The extent to which beneficiary needs are fully met;</P>
              <P>(ii) The availability of care through enrolled providers to beneficiaries in each geographic area, by provider type and site of service;</P>
              <P>(iii) Changes in beneficiary utilization of covered services in each geographic area.</P>
              <P>(iv) The characteristics of the beneficiary population (including considerations for care, service and payment variations for pediatric and adult populations and for individuals with disabilities); and</P>
              <P>(v) Actual or estimated levels of provider payment available from other payers, including other public and private payers, by provider type and site of service.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Access monitoring review plan beneficiary and provider input.</E> The access monitoring review plan must include an analysis of data and the state's conclusion of the sufficiency of access to care that will consider relevant provider and beneficiary information, including information obtained through public rate-setting processes, the medical care advisory committees established under § 431.12 of this chapter, the processes described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, and other mechanisms (such as letters from providers and beneficiaries to State or Federal officials), which describe access to care concerns or suggestions for improvement in access to care.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Access monitoring review plan comparative payment rate review.</E> For each of the services reviewed, by the provider types and sites of service (e.g., primary care physicians in office settings) described within the access monitoring analysis, the access monitoring review plan must include an analysis of the percentage comparison of Medicaid payment rates to other public (including, as practical, Medicaid managed care rates) and private health insurer payment rates within geographic areas of the state.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Access monitoring review plan standards and methodologies.</E> The access monitoring review plan and analysis must, at a minimum, include: The specific measures that the state uses to analyze access to care (such as, but not limited to: Time and distance standards, providers participating in the Medicaid program, providers with open panels, providers accepting new Medicaid beneficiaries, service utilization patterns, identified beneficiary needs, data on beneficiary and provider feedback and suggestions for improvement, the availability of telemedicine and telehealth, and other similar measures), how the measures relate to the access monitoring review plan described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, baseline and updated data associated with the measures, any issues with access that are discovered as a result of the review, and the state agency's recommendations on the sufficiency of access to care based on the review. In addition, the access monitoring review plan must include procedures to periodically monitor access for at least 3 years after the implementation of a provider rate reduction or restructuring, as discussed in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Access monitoring review plan timeframe.</E> Beginning October 1, 2016 the State agency must:</P>
              <P>(i) Develop its access monitoring review plan by October 1 of the first review year, and update this plan by October 1 of each subsequent review period;</P>
              <P>(ii) For all of the following, complete an analysis of the data collected using the methodology specified in the access monitoring review plan in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, with a separate analysis for each provider type and site of service furnishing the type of service at least once every 3 years:</P>
              <P>(A) Primary care services (including those provided by a physician, FQHC, clinic, or dental care).</P>
              <P>(B) Physician specialist services (for example, cardiology, urology, radiology).</P>
              <P>(C) Behavioral health services (including mental health and substance use disorder).</P>
              <P>(D) Pre- and post-natal obstetric services including labor and delivery.</P>
              <P>(E) Home health services.</P>
              <P>(F) Any additional types of services for which a review is required under paragraph (b)(6) of this section;</P>

              <P>(G) Additional types of services for which the state or CMS has received a <PRTPAGE P="460"/>significantly higher than usual volume of beneficiary, provider or other stakeholder access complaints for a geographic area, including complaints received through the mechanisms for beneficiary input consistent with paragraph (b)(7) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(H) Additional types of services selected by the state.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Special provisions for proposed provider rate reductions or restructuring</E>—(i) <E T="03">Compliance with access requirements.</E> The State shall submit with any State plan amendment that proposes to reduce provider payment rates or restructure provider payments in circumstances when the changes could result in diminished access, an access review, in accordance with the access monitoring review plan, for each service affected by the State plan amendments as described under paragraph (b)(1) of this section completed within the prior 12 months. That access review must demonstrate sufficient access for any service for which the state agency proposes to reduce payment rates or restructure provider payments to demonstrate compliance with the access requirements at section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Monitoring procedures.</E> In addition to the analysis conducted through paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section that demonstrates access to care is sufficient as of the effective date of the State plan amendment, a state must establish procedures in its access monitoring review plan to monitor continued access to care after implementation of state plan service rate reduction or payment restructuring. The frequency of monitoring should be informed by the public review described in paragraph (b) of this section and should be conducted no less frequently than annually.</P>
              <P>(A) The procedures must provide for a periodic review of state determined and clearly defined measures, baseline data, and thresholds that will serve to demonstrate continued sustained service access, consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care.</P>
              <P>(B) The monitoring procedures must be in place for a period of at least 3 years after the effective date of the state plan amendment that authorizes the payment reductions or restructuring.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Mechanisms for ongoing beneficiary and provider input.</E> (i) States must have ongoing mechanisms for beneficiary and provider input on access to care (through hotlines, surveys, ombudsman, review of grievance and appeals data, or another equivalent mechanisms), consistent with the access requirements and public process described in § 447.204.</P>
              <P>(ii) States should promptly respond to public input through these mechanisms citing specific access problems, with an appropriate investigation, analysis, and response.</P>
              <P>(iii) States must maintain a record of data on public input and how the state responded to this input. This record will be made available to CMS upon request.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Addressing access questions and remediation of inadequate access to care.</E> When access deficiencies are identified, the state must, within 90 days after discovery, submit a corrective action plan with specific steps and timelines to address those issues. While the corrective action plan may include longer-term objectives, remediation of the access deficiency should take place within 12 months.</P>
              <P>(i) The state's corrective actions may address the access deficiencies through a variety of approaches, including, but not limited to: Increasing payment rates, improving outreach to providers, reducing barriers to provider enrollment, proving additional transportation to services, providing for telemedicine delivery and telehealth, or improving care coordination.</P>
              <P>(ii) The resulting improvements in access must be measured and sustainable.</P>

                <P>(2) For transfers on or after October 1, 1985, the State's methods and standards must provide that the valuation of capital assets for purposes of determining payment rates for NFs and ICFs/IID is not to increase (as measured from the date of acquisition by the seller to the date of the change of <PRTPAGE P="464"/>ownership) solely as a result of a change of ownership, by more than the lesser of—</P>
                <P>(i) One-half of the percentage increase (as measured from the date of acquisition by the seller to the date of the change of ownership, or, if necessary, as extrapolated retrospectively by the Secretary) in the Dodge construction index applied in the aggregate with respect to those facilities that have undergone a change of ownership during the fiscal year; or</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">State data submission requirements.</E> States are required to submit the mean MIUR, determined in accordance with section 1923(b)(1)(A) of the Act, for all hospitals receiving Medicaid payments in the State and the value of one standard deviation above such mean. States must provide the data for State Plan Rate Year (SPRY) 2008, SPRY 2009, SPRY 2010, and SPRY 2011 by June 30, 2014. States must provide this data for each subsequent SPRY to CMS by June 30 of each year. To determine which SPRY's data the state must submit, subtract 3 years from the calendar year in which the data is due. For example, SPRY 2012 data must be submitted to CMS by June 30, 2015.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">DHRM methodology.</E> Section 1923(f)(7) of the Act requires aggregate annual reduction amounts for FY 2014 and FY 2015 to be reduced through the DHRM. The DHRM is calculated on an annual basis based on the most recent data available to CMS at the time of the calculation. The DHRM is determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Establishing State groups.</E> For each FY, CMS will separate low-DSH States and non-low DSH states into distinct State groups.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Aggregate DSH allotment reduction allocation.</E> CMS will allocate a portion of the aggregate DSH allotment reductions to each State group by the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Dividing the sum of each State group's preliminary unreduced DSH allotments by the sum of both State groups' preliminary unreduced DSH allotment amounts to determine a percentage.</P>
              <P>(ii) Multiplying the value of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section by the aggregate DSH allotment reduction amount under paragraph (c) of this section for the applicable fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(i) Multiplying the LDF by the aggregate DSH allotment reduction for the low DSH State group.</P>
              <P>(ii) Utilizing the value of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section as the aggregate DSH allotment reduction allocated to the low DSH State group.</P>
              <P>(iii) Subtracting the value of paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section from the value of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section for the low DSH State group; and</P>

CMS will calculate the BNF for qualifying states by the following:</P>

              <P>(i) For States whose DSH allotment was included in the budget neutrality calculation for a coverage expansion that was approved under section 1115 as <PRTPAGE P="469"/>of July 31, 2009, (without regard to approved amendments since that date) determining the amount of the State's DSH allotment included in the budget neutrality calculation for coverage expansion for the specific fiscal year subject to reduction. This amount is not subject to reductions under the HMF and HUF calculations.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Health insurance coverage limit</E> means a limit imposed by a third party payer that establishes a maximum dollar value or maximum number of specific services, for benefits received by an individual.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Individuals who have no health insurance (or other source of third party coverage) for the services furnished during the year</E> means individuals who have no source of third party coverage for the specific inpatient hospital or outpatient hospital service furnished by the hospital.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">No source of third party coverage for a specific inpatient hospital or outpatient hospital service</E> means that the service is not included in an individual's health benefits coverage through a group health plan or health insurer, and for which there is no other legally liable third party. When a health insurance coverage limit is imposed by a third party payer, specific services beyond the limit would not be within the individual's health benefit package from that third party payer. For American Indians/Alaska Natives, IHS and tribal coverage is only considered third party coverage when services are received directly from IHS or tribal health programs (direct health care services) or when IHS or a tribal health program has authorized coverage through the contract health service program (through a purchase order or equivalent document). Administrative denials of payment, or requirements for satisfaction of deductible, copayment or coinsurance liability, do not affect the determination that a specific service is included in the health benefits coverage.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of an individual's third party coverage status.</E> Individuals who have no source of third party coverage for a specific inpatient hospital or outpatient hospital service must be considered, for purposes of that service, to be uninsured. This determination is not dependent on the receipt of payment by the hospital from the third party.</P>

              <P>(1) The determination of an individual's status as having a source of third party coverage must be a service-specific coverage determination. The service-specific coverage determination can occur only once per individual per service provided and applies to the entire service, including all elements as that service, or similar services, would be defined in Medicaid.<PRTPAGE P="471"/>

              <P>(1) An approved State plan in effect as of September 30, 1991.</P>
              <P>(2) A State plan amendment submitted to CMS by September 30, 1991.</P>
              <P>(3) A State plan amendment, or modification thereof, submitted to CMS between October 1, 1991 and November 26, 1991, if the amendment, or modification thereof, was intended to limit the State's definition of disproportionate share hospitals to those hospitals with Medicaid inpatient utilization rates or low-income utilization rates (as defined in section 1923 (b) of the Act) at or above the statewide arithmetic mean.</P>
              <P>(4) A methodology for disproportionate share hospital payments that was established and in effect as of September 30, 1991, or in accordance with a State law enacted or State regulation adopted as of September 30, 1991.</P>
              <P>(5) A State plan amendment submitted to CMS by September 30, 1992 that increases aggregate disproportionate share hospitals payments in order to meet the minimum payment adjustments required by section 1923(c)(1) of the Act. The minimum payment adjustment is the amount required by the Medicare methodology described in section 1923(c)(1) of the Act for those hospitals that satisfy the minimum Federal definition of a disproportionate share hospital in section 1923(b) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(6) A State plan amendment submitted to CMS by September 30, 1992 that provides for a redistribution of disproportionate share hospital payments within the State without raising total payments compared to the previously approved State plan.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Calculation of State's base allotment for Federal fiscal year 1993.</E> (1) For Federal fiscal year 1993, CMS will calculate for each State a DSH allotment, using the State's “base allotment.” The State's base allotment is the greater of:</P>
              <P>(i) The total amount of the State's projected DSH payments for Federal fiscal year 1992 under the State plan applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992, calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) $1,000,000.</P>
              <P>(2) In calculating the State's DSH payments applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992, CMS will derive amounts from payments applicable to the period of October 1, 1991, through September 30, 1992, under State plans or plan amendments that meet the requirements specified in § 447.296(b). The calculation will not include—</P>
              <P>(i) DSH payment adjustments made by the State applicable to the period October 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991 under State plans or plan amendments that do not meet the criteria described in § 447.296; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Retroactive DSH payments made in 1992 that are not applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992.</P>

              <P>(3) CMS will calculate a percentage for each State by dividing the DSH <PRTPAGE P="473"/>base allotment by the total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures, excluding administrative costs, made during Federal fiscal year 1992. On the basis of this percentage, CMS will classify each State as a “high-DSH” or “low-DSH” State.</P>
              <P>(i) If the State's base allotment exceeded 12 percent of its total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures made under the State plan in Federal fiscal year 1992, CMS will classify the State as a “high-DSH” State.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the State's base allotment was 12 percent or less of its total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures made under the State plan in Federal fiscal year 1992, CMS will classify the State as a “low-DSH” State.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">State disproportionate share hospital allotments for Federal fiscal year 1993.</E> (1) For Federal fiscal year 1993, CMS will calculate a DSH allotment for each low-DSH State that equals the State's base allotment described under paragraph (a) of this section, increased by State growth, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For high-DSH States, the dollar amount of DSH payments in Federal fiscal year 1993 may not exceed the dollar amount of DSH payments applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992 (that is, the State base allotment).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">State disproportionate share hospital allotment for Federal fiscal years 1994 and after.</E> For Federal fiscal years 1994 and after—</P>
              <P>(1) For low-DSH States, CMS will calculate the DSH allotment for each Federal fiscal year by increasing the prior year's State DSHs allotment by—</P>
              <P>(i) State growth, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A supplemental amount, if applicable, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For high-DSH States, the dollar amount of DSH payments applicable to any Federal fiscal year may not exceed the dollar amount of payments applicable to Federal fiscal year 1992 (that is, the State base allotment). This payment limitation will apply until the Federal fiscal year in which the State's DSH payments applicable to that Federal fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of the State's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures in that Federal fiscal year, equal 12 percent or less. When a high-DSH State's percentage equals 12 percent or less, the State will be reclassified as a low-DSH State.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">State growth.</E> (1) The State growth for a State in a Federal fiscal year is equal to the product of—</P>
              <P>(i) The growth factor that is CMS's projected percentage increase in the State's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures (including administrative costs) relative to the corresponding amount in the previous year; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The State's prior year DSH allotment.</P>
              <P>(2) If the growth factor is zero or is negative, the State growth is zero.</P>
              <P>(3) If a low-DSH State experiences a level of negative growth to the extent that its previous Federal fiscal year's DSH allotment would be more than 12 percent of its current Federal fiscal year's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures (excluding administrative costs), the low-DSH State's previous year's DSH allotment will be reduced to the extent necessary to maintain the individual low-DSH State's 12-percent limit and that amount will become the low-DSH State's DSH allotment for the current Federal fiscal year. In no Federal fiscal year will a low-DSH State's DSH allotment be allowed to exceed its individual State 12-percent limit.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Supplemental amount available for low-DSH States.</E> (1) A supplemental amount is the State's share of a pool of money (referred to as a redistribution pool).</P>
              <P>(2) CMS will calculate the redistribution pool for the appropriate Federal fiscal year by subtracting from the projected national DSH expenditure target the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The total of the State DSH base allotments for all high-DSH States;</P>
              <P>(ii) The total of the previous year's State DSH allotments for all low-DSH States;</P>
              <P>(iii) The State growth amount for all low-DSH States; and</P>

              <P>(iv) The total amount of additional DSH payment adjustments made in order to meet the minimum payment adjustments required under section 1923(c)(l) of the Act, which are made in accordance with § 447.296(b)(5).<PRTPAGE P="474"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) CMS will determine the percent of the redistribution pool for each low-DSH State on the basis of each State's relative share of the total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures for the Federal fiscal year compared to the total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures for the Federal fiscal year projected to be made by all low-DSH States. The percent of the redistribution pool that each State will receive is equal to the State's total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures divided by the total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures for all low-DSH States.</P>
              <P>(4) CMS will not provide any low-DSH State a supplemental amount that would result in the State's total DSH allotment exceeding 12 percent of its projected total unadjusted medical assistance expenditures. CMS will reallocate any supplemental amounts not allocated to States because of this 12-percent limitation to other low-DSH States in accordance with the percentage determined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) CMS will not reallocate to low-DSH States the difference between any State's actual DSH expenditures applicable to a Federal fiscal year and its State DSH allotment applicable to that Federal fiscal year. Thus, any unspent DSH allotment may not be reallocated.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Special provision.</E> Any increases in a State's aggregate disproportionate payments, that are made to meet the minimum payment requirements specified in § 447.296(b)(5), may exceed the State base allotment to the extent such increases are made to satisfy the minimum payment requirement. In such cases, CMS will adjust the State's base allotment in the subsequent Federal fiscal year to include the increased minimum payments.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Hospital name.</E> The name of the hospital that received a DSH payment from the State, identifying facilities that are institutes for mental disease (IMDs) and facilities that are located out-of-state.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Estimate of hospital-specific DSH limit.</E> The State's estimate of eligible uncompensated care for the hospital receiving a DSH payment for the year under audit based on the State's methodology for determining such limit.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Medicaid inpatient utilization rate.</E> The hospital's Medicaid inpatient utilization rate, as defined in Section 1923(b)(2) of the Act, if the State does not use alternative qualification criteria described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Low income utilization rate.</E> The hospital's low income utilization rate, as defined in Section 1923(b)(3) of the Act if the State does not use alternative qualification criteria described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>

              <P>(7) <E T="03">IP/OP Medicaid managed care organization payments.</E> The total annual amount paid to the hospital by Medicaid managed care organizations for inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services furnished to Medicaid eligible individuals.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Supplemental/enhanced Medicaid IP/OP payments.</E> Indicate the total annual amount of supplemental/enhanced Medicaid payments made to the hospital under the State plan.

              <P>(10) <E T="03">Total Cost of Care for Medicaid IP/OP Services.</E> The total annual costs incurred by each hospital for furnishing inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services to Medicaid eligible individuals. The total annual costs are determined on a hospital-specific basis, not a service-specific basis. For purposes of this section, costs—</P>
              <P>(i) Are defined as costs net of third-party payments, including, but not limited to, payments by Medicare and private insurance.</P>
              <P>(ii) Must capture the total burden on the hospital of treating Medicaid eligible patients prior to payment by Medicaid. Thus, costs must be determined in the aggregate and not by estimating the cost of individual patients. For example, if a hospital treats two Medicaid eligible patients at a cost of $2,000 and receives a $500 payment from a third party for each individual, the total cost to the hospital for purposes of this section is $1,000, regardless of whether the third party payment received for one patient exceeds the cost of providing the service to that individual.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Total Medicaid Uncompensated Care.</E> The total amount of uncompensated care attributable to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient services.

              <P>(iii) The uninsured uncompensated amount also cannot include amounts associated with unpaid co-pays or deductibles for individuals with third party coverage for the inpatient and/or outpatient hospital services they receive or any other unreimbursed costs associated with inpatient and/or outpatient hospital services provided to individuals with those services in their third party coverage benefit package.</P>
              <P>(iv) The uncompensated care costs do not include bad debt or payer discounts related to services furnished to individuals who have health insurance or other third party payer.</P>
              <P>(16) <E T="03">Total annual uncompensated care costs.</E> The total annual uncompensated care cost equals the total cost of care for furnishing inpatient hospital and <PRTPAGE P="476"/>outpatient hospital services to Medicaid eligible individuals and to individuals with no source of third party coverage for the hospital services they receive less the sum of regular Medicaid FFS rate payments, Medicaid managed care organization payments, supplemental/enhanced Medicaid payments, uninsured revenues, and Section 1011 payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services. This should equal the sum of paragraphs (c)(9),(c)(12), and (c)(13) subtracted from the sum of paragraphs (c)(10) and (c)(14) of this section.</P>
              <P>(17) <E T="03">Disproportionate share hospital payments.</E> Indicate total annual payment adjustments made to the hospital under Section 1923 of the Act.</P>

For out-of-State hospitals, States must report, at a minimum, the information identified in § 447.299(c)(1) through (c)(6), (c)(8), (c)(9), (c)(17), (c)(18), and (c)(19).</P>
              <P>(d) Each State must maintain, in readily reviewable form, supporting documentation that provides a detailed description of each DSH program, the legal basis of each DSH program, and the amount of DSH payments made to each individual public and private provider or facility each quarter. This information must be made available to Federal reviewers upon request.</P>
              <P>(e) If a State fails to comply with the reporting requirements contained in this section, future grant awards will be reduced by the amount of FFP CMS estimates is attributable to the expenditures made to the disproportionate share hospitals as to which the State has not reported properly, until such time as the State complies with the reporting requirements. Deferrals and/or disallowances of equivalent amounts may also be imposed with respect to quarters for which the State has failed to report properly. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, FFP for those expenditures will be released when the State complies with all reporting requirements.</P>

                <P>(1) The agency may pay for other ambulatory services and rural health clinic services at a single rate per visit that is based on the cost of all services furnished by the clinic. The rate must be determined by a Medicare carrier under §§ 405.2426 through 405.2429 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(2) The agency may pay for other ambulatory services at a rate set for each service by the agency. The rate must not exceed the upper limits in this subpart. The agency must pay for rural health clinic services at the Medicare reimbursement rate per visit, as specified in § 405.2426 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(3) The agency may pay for dental services at a rate per visit that is based on the cost of dental services furnished by the clinic. The rate must be determined by a Medicare carrier under §§ 405.2426 through 405.2429 of this chapter. The agency must pay for ambulatory services other than dental services under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) For purposes of paragraph (c) (1) and (3) of this section, “visit” means a face-to-face encounter between a clinic patient and any health professional whose services are reimbursed under the State plan. Encounters with more than one health professional, and multiple encounters with the same health professional, that take place on the same day and at a single location constitute a single visit, except when the patient, after the first encounter, suffers illness or injury requiring additional diagnosis or treatment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements for manufacturers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Quarterly reports.</E> A manufacturer must report product and pricing information for covered outpatient drugs to CMS not later than 30 days after the end of the rebate period. The quarterly pricing report must include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) AMP, calculated in accordance with § 447.504.</P>
              <P>(2) Best price, calculated in accordance with § 447.505.</P>
              <P>(3) Customary prompt pay discounts, which are reported as an aggregate dollar amount for each covered outpatient drug at the nine-digit NDC level, provided to all wholesalers in the rebate period.</P>

              <P>(4) Prices that fall within the nominal price exclusion, which are reported as an aggregate dollar amount and include all sales of single source and innovator multiple source drugs to the <PRTPAGE P="492"/>entities listed in § 447.508(a) for the rebate period.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting revised quarterly AMP, best price, customary prompt pay discounts, or nominal prices.</E> (1) A manufacturer must report to CMS any revision to AMP, best price, customary prompt pay discounts, or nominal prices for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data were due. Any revision request that exceeds 12 quarters will not be considered, except for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(i) The change is a result of the drug category change or a market date change.</P>
              <P>(ii) The change is an initial submission for a product.</P>
              <P>(iii) The change is due to termination of a manufacturer from the MDR program for failure to submit pricing data and must submit pricing data to reenter the program.</P>
              <P>(iv) The change is due to a technical correction; that is, not based on any changes in sales transactions or pricing adjustments from such transactions.</P>
              <P>(v) The change is to address specific rebate adjustments to States by manufacturers, as required by CMS or court order, or under an internal investigation, or an OIG or Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation.</P>
              <P>(2) A manufacturer must report revised AMP within the 12-quarter time period, except when the revision would be solely as a result of data pertaining to lagged price concessions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Base date AMP report</E>—(1) <E T="03">Reporting period.</E> A manufacturer may report a revised Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) base date AMP to CMS within the first 4 full calendar quarters following July 17, 2007.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Recalculation of the DRA base date AMP.</E> (i) A manufacturer's recalculation of the DRA base date AMP must only reflect the revisions to AMP as provided for in § 447.504 in effect from October 1, 2007 to December 14, 2010.</P>
              <P>(ii) A manufacturer may choose to recalculate the DRA base date AMP on a product-by-product basis.</P>
              <P>(iii) A manufacturer must use actual and verifiable pricing records in recalculating the DRA base date AMP.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reporting a revised Affordable Care Act base date AMP.</E> A manufacturer may report a revised Affordable Care Act base date AMP to CMS within the first 4 full calendar quarters following April 1, 2016.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Recalculation of the Affordable Care Act base date AMP.</E> (i) A manufacturer's recalculation of the Affordable Care Act base date AMP must only reflect the revisions to AMP as provided for in § 447.504.</P>
              <P>(ii) A manufacturer may choose to recalculate the Affordable Care Act base date AMP on a product-by-product basis.</P>
              <P>(iii) A manufacturer must use actual and verifiable pricing records in recalculating the Affordable Care Act base date AMP.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Monthly AMP</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Monthly AMP means the AMP that is calculated on a monthly basis. A manufacturer must submit a monthly AMP to CMS not later than 30 days after the last day of each prior month.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Calculation of monthly AMP.</E> Monthly AMP is calculated based on § 447.504, except the period covered is based on monthly, as opposed to quarterly, sales.</P>
              <P>(i) The monthly AMP is calculated based on the weighted average of prices for all the manufacturer's package sizes of each covered outpatient drug sold by the manufacturer during a month.</P>
              <P>(ii) It is calculated as net sales divided by number of units sold, excluding goods or any other items specifically excluded in the statute or regulations. Monthly AMP is calculated based on the best data available to the manufacturer at the time of submission.</P>
              <P>(iii) In calculating monthly AMP, a manufacturer must estimate the impact of its lagged AMP-eligible price concessions using a 12-month rolling percentage in accordance with the methodology described in this paragraph (d)(2).</P>

              <P>(A) For each NDC-9 with at least 12 months of AMP-eligible sales, after adjusting for sales excluded from AMP, the manufacturer calculates a percentage equal to the sum of the price concessions for the most recent 12-month period (inclusive of the current reporting period) available associated with <PRTPAGE P="493"/>sales subject to the AMP reporting requirement divided by the total in dollars for the sales subject to the AMP reporting requirement for the same 12-month period.</P>
              <P>(B) For each NDC-9 with less than 12 months of AMP-eligible sales, the calculation described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is performed for the time period equaling the total number of months of AMP-eligible sales.</P>
              <P>(iv) The manufacturer multiplies the applicable percentage described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section by the total in dollars for the sales subject to the AMP reporting requirement (after adjusting for sales excluded from AMP) for the month being submitted. The result of this multiplication is then subtracted from the total in dollars for the sales subject to the AMP reporting requirement (after adjusting for sales excluded from AMP) for the month being submitted.</P>
              <P>(v) The manufacturer uses the result of the calculation described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section as the numerator and the number of units sold in the month (after adjusting for sales excluded from AMP) as the denominator to calculate the manufacturer's AMP for the NDC for the month being submitted.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Example.</E> After adjusting for sales excluded from AMP, the total lagged price concessions over the most recent 12-month period available associated with sales for NDC 12345-6789 subject to the AMP reporting requirement equal $200,000, and the total in dollars for the sales subject to the AMP reporting requirement for the same period equals $600,000. The lagged price concessions percentage for this period equals 200,000/600,000 = 0.33333. The total in dollars for the sales subject to the AMP reporting requirement for the month being reported equals $50,000 for 10,000 units sold. The manufacturer's AMP calculation for this NDC for this month is: $50,000−(0.33333 × $50,000) = $33,334 (net total sales amount); $33,334/10,000 = $3.33340 (AMP).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Timeframe for reporting revised monthly AMP.</E> A manufacturer must report to CMS revisions to monthly AMP for a period not to exceed 36 months from the month in which the data were due, except as allowed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Exception.</E> A manufacturer must report revisions to monthly AMP within the 36-month time period, except when the revision would be solely as a result of data pertaining to lagged price concessions.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Terminated products.</E> A manufacturer must not report a monthly AMP for a terminated product beginning with the first month after the expiration date of the last lot sold.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Monthly AMP units.</E> A manufacturer must report the total number of units that are used to calculate the monthly AMP in the same unit type as used to compute the AMP to CMS not later than 30 days after the last day of each month.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification of pricing reports.</E> Each report submitted under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section must be certified by one of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer's chief executive officer (CEO).</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer's chief financial officer (CFO).</P>
              <P>(3) An individual other than a CEO or CFO, who has authority equivalent to a CEO or a CFO; or</P>
              <P>(4) An individual with the directly delegated authority to perform the certification on behalf of an individual described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Recordkeeping requirements.</E> (1) A manufacturer must retain records (written or electronic) for 10 years from the date the manufacturer reports data to CMS for that rebate period.</P>
              <P>(i) The records must include these data and any other materials from which the calculations of the AMP, the best price, customary prompt pay discounts, and nominal prices are derived, including a record of any assumptions made in the calculations.</P>
              <P>(ii) The 10-year timeframe applies to a manufacturer's quarterly and monthly submissions of pricing data, as well as any revised pricing data subsequently submitted to CMS.</P>
              <P>(2) A manufacturer must retain records beyond the 10-year period if all of the following circumstances exist:</P>

              <P>(i) The records are the subject of an audit, or of a government investigation <PRTPAGE P="494"/>related to pricing data that are used in AMP, best price, customary prompt pay discounts, or nominal prices of which the manufacturer is aware.</P>
              <P>(ii) The audit findings or investigation related to the AMP, best price, customary prompt pay discounts, or nominal price have not been resolved.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Data reporting format.</E> All product and pricing data, whether submitted on a quarterly or monthly basis, must be submitted to CMS in an electronic format designated by CMS.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Multiple source drugs.</E> Except for brand name drugs that are certified in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the agency payment for multiple source drugs must not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount that would result from the application of the specific limits established in accordance with § 447.514. If a specific limit has not been established under § 447.514, then the rule for “other drugs” set forth in paragraph (b) of this section applies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Other drugs.</E> The agency payments for brand name drugs certified in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and drugs other than multiple source drugs for which a specific limit has been established under § 447.514 must not exceed, in the aggregate, payment levels that the agency has determined by applying the lower of the following:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Establishment and issuance of a listing.</E> (1) CMS will establish and issue listings that identify and set upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis that <PRTPAGE P="495"/>FDA has rated at least three drug products as pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent in the “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” which is available at <E T="03">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/.</E> Only pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent formulations will be used to determine such limit, and such limit will only be applied to those equivalent drug products.</P>
              <P>(2) CMS publishes the list of multiple source drugs for which upper limits have been established and any revisions to the list in Medicaid Program issuances.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific upper limits.</E> (1) The agency's payments for multiple source drugs identified and listed periodically by CMS in Medicaid Program issuances must not exceed, in the aggregate, prior to the application of any federal or state drug rebate considerations, payment levels determined by applying for each pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multiple source drug product, a professional dispensing fee established by the state agency plus an amount established by CMS that is equal to 175 percent of the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly AMPs for such multiple source drugs, using manufacturer submitted utilization data for each multiple source drug for which a Federal upper limit (FUL) is established.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception.</E> If the amount established by CMS in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for a pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multiple source drug product is lower than the average retail community pharmacies' acquisition cost for such drug product, as determined by the most current national survey of such costs, CMS will use a percent of the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly AMPs that equals the most current average acquisition costs paid by retail community pharmacies as determined by such survey.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Ensuring a drug is for sale nationally.</E> To assure that a multiple source drug is for sale nationally, CMS will consider the following additional criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) The AMP of a terminated NDC will not be used to set the Federal upper limit (FUL) beginning with the first day of the month after the termination date reported by the manufacturer to CMS.</P>
              <P>(2) The monthly AMP units data will be used to calculate the weighted average of monthly AMPs for all multiple source drugs to establish the FUL.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> The agency must maintain and make available to CMS, upon request, data, mathematical or statistical computations, comparisons, and any other pertinent records to support its findings and assurances.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Data requirements.</E> When proposing changes to either the ingredient cost reimbursement or professional dispensing fee reimbursement, States are required to evaluate their proposed changes in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, and States must consider both the ingredient cost reimbursement and the professional dispensing fee reimbursement when proposing such changes to ensure that total reimbursement to the pharmacy provider is in accordance with requirements of section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act. States must provide adequate data such as a State or national survey of retail pharmacy providers or other reliable data other than a survey to support any proposed changes to either or both of the components of the reimbursement methodology. States must submit to CMS the proposed change in reimbursement and the supporting data through a State plan amendment through the formal review process.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Suspension of payments in cases of fraud.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for suspension.</E> (1) The State Medicaid agency must suspend all Medicaid payments to a provider after the agency determines there is a credible allegation of fraud for which an investigation is pending under the Medicaid program against an individual or entity unless the agency has good cause to not suspend payments or to suspend payment only in part.</P>
              <P>(2) The State Medicaid agency may suspend payments without first notifying the provider of its intention to suspend such payments.</P>
              <P>(3) A provider may request, and must be granted, administrative review where State law so requires.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of suspension.</E> (1) The State agency must send notice of its suspension of program payments within the following timeframes:</P>
              <P>(i) Five days of taking such action unless requested in writing by a law enforcement agency to temporarily withhold such notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) Thirty days if requested by law enforcement in writing to delay sending such notice, which request for delay may be renewed in writing up to twice and in no event may exceed 90 days.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice must include or address all of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) State that payments are being suspended in accordance with this provision.</P>
              <P>(ii) Set forth the general allegations as to the nature of the suspension action, but need not disclose any specific information concerning an ongoing investigation.</P>
              <P>(iii) State that the suspension is for a temporary period, as stated in paragraph (c) of this section, and cite the circumstances under which the suspension will be terminated.</P>
              <P>(iv) Specify, when applicable, to which type or types of Medicaid claims or business units of a provider suspension is effective.</P>
              <P>(v) Inform the provider of the right to submit written evidence for consideration by State Medicaid Agency.</P>
              <P>(vi) Set forth the applicable State administrative appeals process and corresponding citations to State law.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Duration of suspension.</E> (1) All suspension of payment actions under this section will be temporary and will not continue after either of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The agency or the prosecuting authorities determine that there is insufficient evidence of fraud by the provider.</P>
              <P>(ii) Legal proceedings related to the provider's alleged fraud are completed.</P>
              <P>(2) A State must document in writing the termination of a suspension including, where applicable and appropriate, any appeal rights available to a provider.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Referrals to the Medicaid fraud control unit.</E> (1) Whenever a State Medicaid agency investigation leads to the initiation of a payment suspension in whole or part, the State Medicaid Agency must make a fraud referral to either of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) To a Medicaid fraud control unit established and certified under part 1007 of this title; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In States with no certified Medicaid fraud control unit, to an appropriate law enforcement agency.</P>
              <P>(2) The fraud referral made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must meet all of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Be made in writing and provided to the Medicaid fraud control unit not later than the next business day after the suspension is enacted.</P>
              <P>(ii) Conform to fraud referral performance standards issued by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) If the Medicaid fraud control unit or other law enforcement agency accepts the fraud referral for investigation, the payment suspension may be continued until such time as the investigation and any associated enforcement proceedings are completed.</P>

              <P>(ii) On a quarterly basis, the State must request a certification from the Medicaid fraud control unit or other law enforcement agency that any matter accepted on the basis of a referral continues to be under investigation <PRTPAGE P="502"/>thus warranting continuation of the suspension.</P>
              <P>(4) If the Medicaid fraud control unit or other law enforcement agency declines to accept the fraud referral for investigation the payment suspension must be discontinued unless the State Medicaid agency has alternative Federal or State authority by which it may impose a suspension or makes a fraud referral to another law enforcement agency. In that situation, the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section apply equally to that referral as well.</P>
              <P>(5) A State's decision to exercise the good cause exceptions in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section not to suspend payments or to suspend payments only in part does not relieve the State of the obligation to refer any credible allegation of fraud as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Good cause not to suspend payments.</E> A State may find that good cause exists not to suspend payments, or not to continue a payment suspension previously imposed, to an individual or entity against which there is an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud if any of the following are applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) Law enforcement officials have specifically requested that a payment suspension not be imposed because such a payment suspension may compromise or jeopardize an investigation.</P>
              <P>(2) Other available remedies implemented by the State more effectively or quickly protect Medicaid funds.</P>
              <P>(3) The State determines, based upon the submission of written evidence by the individual or entity that is the subject of the payment suspension, that the suspension should be removed.</P>
              <P>(4) beneficiary access to items or services would be jeopardized by a payment suspension because of either of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) An individual or entity is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community.</P>
              <P>(ii) The individual or entity serves a large number of beneficiaries within a HRSA-designated medically underserved area.</P>
              <P>(5) Law enforcement declines to certify that a matter continues to be under investigation per the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) The State determines that payment suspension is not in the best interests of the Medicaid program.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Good cause to suspend payment only in part.</E> A State may find that good cause exists to suspend payments in part, or to convert a payment suspension previously imposed in whole to one only in part, to an individual or entity against which there is an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud if any of the following are applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) beneficiary access to items or services would be jeopardized by a payment suspension in whole or part because of either of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) An individual or entity is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community.</P>
              <P>(ii) The individual or entity serves a large number of beneficiaries within a HRSA-designated medically underserved area.</P>
              <P>(2) The State determines, based upon the submission of written evidence by the individual or entity that is the subject of a whole payment suspension, that such suspension should be imposed only in part.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The credible allegation focuses solely and definitively on only a specific type of claim or arises from only a specific business unit of a provider; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The State determines and documents in writing that a payment suspension in part would effectively ensure that potentially fraudulent claims were not continuing to be paid.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Indirect ownership interest.</E> The amount of indirect ownership interest is determined by multiplying the percentages of ownership in each entity. For example, if A owns 10 percent of the stock in a corporation which owns 80 percent of the stock of the disclosing entity, A's interest equates to an 8 percent indirect ownership interest in the disclosing entity and must be reported. Conversely, if B owns 80 percent of the stock of a corporation which owns 5 percent of the stock of the disclosing entity, B's interest equates to a 4 percent indirect ownership interest in the disclosing entity and need not be reported.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Person with an ownership or control interest.</E> In order to determine percentage of ownership, mortgage, deed of trust, note, or other obligation, the percentage of interest owned in the obligation is multiplied by the percentage of the disclosing entity's assets used to secure the obligation. For example, if A owns 10 percent of a note secured by 60 percent of the provider's assets, A's interest in the provider's assets equates to 6 percent and must be reported. Conversely, if B owns 40 percent of a note secured by 10 percent of the provider's assets, B's interest in the provider's assets equates to 4 percent and need not be reported.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Denial or termination.</E> The failure of the provider to fully and completely report the information required in this section when the provider knew or should reasonably have known of this information may result in, as applicable, the denial of the provider's initial enrollment application or the termination of the provider's enrollment in Medicaid or CHIP.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Undue risk.</E> Upon receipt of the information described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the State, in consultation with CMS, determines whether any of the disclosed affiliations poses an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse by considering the following factors:</P>

              <P>(C) To whom the debt is owed.</P>
              <P>(v) If a denial, revocation, termination, exclusion, or payment suspension is involved, the reason for the disclosable event.</P>
              <P>(6) Any other evidence that the State, in consultation with CMS, deems relevant to its determination.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Determination of undue risk.</E> A determination by the State, in consultation with CMS, that a particular affiliation poses an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse will result in, as applicable, the denial of the provider's initial enrollment in Medicaid or CHIP or the termination of the provider's enrollment in Medicaid or CHIP.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Undisclosed affiliations.</E> The State, in consultation with CMS, may apply paragraph (g) of this section to situations where a reportable affiliation (as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) poses an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse, but the provider has not yet disclosed or is not required at that time to disclose the affiliation to the State.</P>

                <E T="03">Independent certified audit</E> means an audit that is conducted by an auditor that operates independently from the Medicaid agency or subject hospitals and is eligible to perform the DSH audit. Certification means that the independent auditor engaged by the State reviews the criteria of the Federal audit regulation and completes the verification, calculations and report under the professional rules and generally accepted standards of audit practice. This certification would include a review of the State's audit protocol to ensure that the Federal regulation is satisfied, an opinion for each verification detailed in the regulation, and a determination of whether or not the State made DSH payments that exceeded any hospital's specific DSH limit in the Medicaid State plan rate year under audit. The certification should also identify any data issues or other caveats that the auditor identified as impacting the results of the audit.<PRTPAGE P="512"/>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Medicaid State Plan Rate Year</E> means the 12-month period defined by a State's approved Medicaid State plan in which the State estimates eligible uncompensated care costs and determines corresponding disproportionate share hospital payments as well as all other Medicaid payment rates. The period usually corresponds with the State's fiscal year or the Federal fiscal year but can correspond to any 12-month period defined by the State as the Medicaid State plan rate year.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Condition for Federal financial participation (FFP).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> (1) The State must submit an independent certified audit to CMS for each completed Medicaid State plan rate year, consistent with the requirements in this subpart, to receive Federal payments under Section 1903(a)(1) of the Act based on State expenditures for disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments for Medicaid State plan rate years subsequent to the date the audit is due, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) FFP is not available in expenditures for DSH payments that are found in the independent certified audit to exceed the hospital-specific eligible uncompensated care cost limit, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Timing.</E> For Medicaid State plan rate years 2005 and 2006, a State must submit to CMS an independent certified audit report no later than the last day of calendar year 2009. Each subsequent audit beginning with Medicaid State plan rate year 2007 must be completed by the last day of the Federal fiscal year ending three years from the end of the Medicaid State plan rate year under audit. Completed audit reports must be submitted to CMS no later than 90 days after completion. Post-audit adjustments based on claims for the Medicaid State plan rate year paid subsequent to the audit date, if any, must be submitted in the quarter the claim was paid.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> In order to complete the independent certified audit, States must use the following data sources:</P>
              <P>(1) Approved Medicaid State plan for the Medicaid State plan rate year under audit.</P>
              <P>(2) Payment and utilization information from the State's Medicaid Management Information System.</P>
              <P>(3) The Medicare 2552-96 hospital cost report(s) applicable to the Medicaid State plan rate year under audit. If the Medicare 2552-96 is superseded by an alternate Medicare developed cost reporting tool during an audit year, that tool must be used for the Medicaid State plan rate year under audit.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Verification 1:</E> Each hospital that qualifies for a DSH payment in the State is allowed to retain that payment so that the payment is available to offset its uncompensated care costs for furnishing inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services during the Medicaid State plan rate year to Medicaid eligible individuals and individuals with no source of third party coverage for the services in order to reflect the total amount of claimed DSH expenditures.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Verification 2:</E> DSH payments made to each qualifying hospital comply with the hospital-specific DSH payment limit. For each audited Medicaid State plan rate year, the DSH payments made in that audited Medicaid State plan rate year must be measured against the actual uncompensated care cost in that same audited Medicaid State plan rate year.</P>

              <P>(a) The entity must demonstrate to a State that it has the technical capability to carry out the activities described in § 455.506 of this subpart. Evaluation of technical capability must include the employment of trained medical professionals, as defined by the State, who are in good standing with the relevant State licensing authorities, where applicable, to review Medicaid claims.</P>

              <P>(b) The entity must hire a minimum of 1.0 FTE Contractor Medical Director who is a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy in good standing with <PRTPAGE P="518"/>the relevant State licensing authorities and has relevant work and educational experience. A State may seek to be excepted, in accordance with § 455.516, from requiring its RAC to hire a minimum of 1.0 FTE Contractor Medical Director by submitting to CMS a written request for CMS review and approval.</P>
              <P>(c) The entity must hire certified coders unless the State determines that certified coders are not required for the effective review of Medicaid claims.</P>
              <P>(d) The entity must work with the State to develop an education and outreach program, which includes notification to providers of audit policies and protocols.</P>
              <P>(e) The entity must provide minimum customer service measures including:</P>
              <P>(1) Providing a toll-free customer service telephone number in all correspondence sent to providers and staffing the toll-free number during normal business hours from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the applicable time zone.</P>
              <P>(2) Compiling and maintaining provider approved addresses and points of contact.</P>

              <P>(f) The entity must not review claims that are older than 3 years from the date of the claim, unless it receives approval from the State.</P>
              <P>(g) The entity should not audit claims that have already been audited or that are currently being audited by another entity.</P>
              <P>(h) The entity must refer suspected cases of fraud and/or abuse to the State in a timely manner, as defined by the State.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Payments to RACs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Fees paid to RACs must be made only from amounts recovered.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overpayments.</E> States must determine the contingency fee rate to be paid to Medicaid RACs for the identification and recovery of Medicaid provider overpayments.</P>
              <P>(1) The contingency fees paid to Medicaid RACs must be based on a percentage of the overpayment recovered.</P>
              <P>(2) States must determine at what stage in the Medicaid RAC audit process, after an overpayment has been recovered, Medicaid RACs will receive contingency fee payments.</P>
              <P>(3) If a provider appeals a Medicaid RAC overpayment determination and the determination is reversed, at any level, then the Medicaid RAC must return the contingency fees associated with that payment within a reasonable timeframe, as prescribed by the State.</P>

              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of this section, the contingency fee may not exceed that of the highest Medicare RAC, as specified by CMS in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> unless the State submits, and CMS approves, a waiver of the specified maximum rate. If a State does not obtain a waiver of the specified maximum rate, any amount exceeding the specified maximum rate is not eligible for FFP, either from the collected overpayment amounts, or in the form of any other administrative or medical assistance claimed expenditure.</P>
              <P>(5) CMS will review and consider, on a case-by-case basis, a State's well-justified request that CMS provide FFP in paying a Medicaid RAC(s) a contingency fee in excess of the then-highest contingency fee paid to a Medicare RAC.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Underpayments.</E> (1) States must determine the fee paid to a Medicaid RAC to identify underpayments.</P>
              <P>(2) States must adequately incentivize the detection of underpayments.</P>
              <P>(3) States must notify providers of underpayments that are identified by the RACs.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 456.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Basis and purpose of part.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part prescribes requirements concerning control of the utilization of Medicaid services including—</P>
              <P>(1) A statewide program of control of the utilization of all Medicaid services; and</P>
              <P>(2) Specific requirements for the control of the utilization of Medicaid services in institutions.</P>
              <P>(3) Specific requirements for an outpatient drug use review program.</P>
              <P>(b) The requirements in this part are based on the following sections of the Act. Table 1 shows the relationship between these sections of the Act and the requirements in this part.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Methods and procedures to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of <PRTPAGE P="522"/>care and services.</E> Section 1902(a)(30) requires that the State plan provide methods and procedures to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of care and services.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Penalty for failure to have an effective program to control utilization of institutional services.</E> Section 1903(g)(1) provides for a reduction in the amount of Federal Medicaid funds paid to a State for long-stay inpatient services if the State does not make a showing satisfactory to the Secretary that it has an effective program of control over utilization of those services. This penalty provision applies to inpatient services in hospitals, mental hospitals, and intermediate care facilities (ICF's). Specific requirements are:</P>
              <P>(i) Under section 1903(g)(1)(A), a physician must certify at admission, and a physician (or physician assistant or nurse practitioner under the supervision of a physician) must periodically recertify, the individual's need for inpatient care.</P>
              <P>(ii) Under section 1903(g)(1)(B), services must be furnished under a plan established and periodically evaluated by a physician.</P>
              <P>(iii) Under section 1903(g)(1)(C), the State must have in effect a continuous program of review of utilization of care and services under section 1902(a)(30) whereby each admission is reviewed or screened in accordance with criteria established by medical and other professional personnel.</P>
              <P>(iv) Under section 1903(g)(1)(D), the State must have an effective program under sections 1902(a) (26) and (31) of review of care in intermediate care facilities and mental hospitals. This must include evaluation at least annually of the professional management of each case.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Medical review in mental hospitals.</E> Section 1902(a)(26)(A) requires that the plan provide for a program of medical review that includes a medical evaluation of each individual's need for care in a mental hospital, a plan of care, and, where applicable, a plan of rehabilitation.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Independent professional review in intermediate care facilities.</E> Section 1902(a)(31)(A) requires that the plan provide for a program of independent professional review that includes a medical evaluation of each individual's need for intermediate care and a written plan of service.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Inspection of care and services in institutions.</E> Sections 1902(a)(26) (B) and (C) and 1902(a)(31) (B) and (C) require that the plan provide for periodic inspections and reports, by a team of professional persons, of the care being provided to each beneficiary in institutions for mental diseases (IMD's), and ICF's participating in Medicaid.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Denial of FFP for failure to have specified utilization review procedures.</E> Section 1903(i)(4) provides that FFP is not available in a State's expenditures for hospital or mental hospital services unless the institution has in effect a utilization review plan that meets Medicare requirements. However, the Secretary may waive this requirement if the Medicaid agency demonstrates to his satisfaction that it has utilization review procedures superior in effectiveness to the Medicare procedures.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">State health agency guidance on quality and appropriateness of care and services.</E> Section 1902(a)(33)(A) requires that the plan provide that the State health or other appropriate medical agency establish a plan for review, by professional health personnel, of the appropriateness and quality of Medicaid services to provide guidance to the Medicaid agency and the State licensing agency in administering the Medicaid program.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Drug use review program.</E> Section 1927(g) of the Act provides that, for payment to be made under section 1903 of the Act for covered outpatient drugs, the State must have in operation, by not later than January 1, 1993, a drug use review (DUR) program. It also requires that each State provide, either directly or through a contract with a private organization, for the establishment of a DUR Board.</P>

              <P>(a) For each level of care specified in a provider agreement, and for each <PRTPAGE P="547"/>quarter for which a satisfactory showing is not made, the amount of the reduction in FFP is computed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For each level of care, the number of beneficiaries who received services in facilities that did not meet the requirements of this subpart is divided by the total number of beneficiaries who received services in facilities for which a showing was required under this subpart. If any of the requirements specified in § 456.652(a)(1) through (4) were not met for any beneficiary in a facility, the reduction will be computed on the total number of beneficiaries in that facility at the level of care in question.</P>
              <P>(2) The fraction obtained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is multiplied by one-third.</P>
              <P>(3) The product obtained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is multiplied by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP).</P>
              <P>(4) The product obtained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is multiplied by the agency payments for longstay services furnished during the quarter at that level of care.</P>
              <P>(b) If any of the data required to compute the amount of the reduction in FFP are unavailable, the Administrator will substitute an estimate. If the agency determines the exact data to the satisfaction of the Administrator, the estimate may later be adjusted. If the number of beneficiaries in individual facilities is not available, the fraction specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be estimated, for each level of care, by dividing the number of facilities in which the requirements were not met by the total number of facilities for which a showing is required under this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Drug use review program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in order for FFP to be paid or made available under section 1903 of the Act for covered outpatient drugs, the State must have in operation, by not later than January 1, 1993, a DUR program consisting of prospective drug review, retrospective drug use review, and an educational program that meets the requirements of this subpart. The goal of the State's DUR program must be to ensure appropriate drug therapy, while permitting sufficient professional prerogatives to allow for individualized drug therapy.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception for drugs dispensed to certain nursing facility residents.</E> Prospective drug review and retrospective drug use review (including interventions and education) under the DUR program are not required for drugs dispensed to residents of nursing facilities that are in compliance with the drug regimen review procedures set forth in part 483 of this chapter. This does not preclude the State agency from making such drugs subject to prospective DUR or retrospective DUR or both, provided the State agency makes the drugs subject to all the requirements of this subpart applicable to the respective review.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemption for certain covered outpatient drugs dispensed by hospitals and health maintenance organizations.</E> (1) The State plan must provide that covered outpatient drugs dispensed by a hospital using drug formulary systems and billed to the plan at no more than the hospital's purchasing costs are not subject to the requirements of this subpart. Individual hospitals requesting this exemption must provide assurances to the State agency that they meet the requirements specified in section 1927(j)(2) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(2) The State plan must provide that covered outpatient drugs dispensed by health maintenance organizations are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of predetermined standards.</E> A DUR program must assess drug use information against predetermined standards.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Source of predetermined standards.</E> The predetermined standards must be—</P>
              <P>(1) Developed directly by the State or its contractor;</P>
              <P>(2) Obtained by the State through contracts with commercial vendors of DUR services;</P>
              <P>(3) Obtained by the State from independent organizations, such as the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, or entities receiving funding from the Public Health Service, CMS, or State agencies; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any combination of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Requirements for predetermined standards.</E> The predetermined standards used in the DUR program must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The source materials for their development are consistent with peer-reviewed medical literature (that is, scientific, medical, and pharmaceutical publications in which original manuscripts are published only after having been critically reviewed by unbiased independent experts) and the following compendia:</P>
              <P>(i) American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information;</P>
              <P>(ii) United States Pharmacopeia-Drug Information;</P>
              <P>(iii) American Medical Association Drug Evaluations.</P>
              <P>(2) Differences between source materials were resolved by physicians and pharmacists developing consensus solutions. The consensus process means the reliance, by the criteria developers, on the expertise of physicians and pharmacists to evaluate differences in criteria source materials and to come to agreement on how differences should be resolved.</P>
              <P>(3) They are non-proprietary and readily available to providers of services. Systems and algorithms using the predetermined standards may remain proprietary.</P>
              <P>(4) They are clinically-based and scientifically valid.</P>

              <P>(5) The review based on clinical criteria uses predetermined standards to determine the population at risk of a clinically significant adverse medical result and applies standards, appropriate to this population, across providers and patients to determine the provider outliers whose prescribing, dispensing, or consumption practices may not conform to accepted standards <PRTPAGE P="549"/>of care. Various statistical measures (including mean, range, or other measures at the discretion of the State) may be applied to these data. Standards may be considered in deciding if an in-depth review is needed to determine whether to intervene once the potential therapeutic problems have been identified through the use of clinical criteria.</P>
              <P>(6) They have been tested against claims data prior to adoption in order to validate the level of possibly significant therapeutic problems without undue levels of false positives.</P>
              <P>(7) The predetermined standards for prospective and retrospective DUR are compatible.</P>
              <P>(8) They are subjected to ongoing evaluation and modification either as a result of actions by their developer or as a result of recommendations by the DUR Board.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Access to predetermined standards.</E> Upon their adoption, predetermined standards must be available to the public. Pharmacists and physicians must be informed of the existence of predetermined standards and of how they can obtain copies of them.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Confidentiality of patient related data.</E> In implementing the DUR program, the agency must establish, in regulations or through other means, policies concerning confidentiality of patient related data that are consistent with applicable Federal confidentiality requirements at part 431, subpart F of this chapter; the State Pharmacy Practice Act; and the guidelines adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy or other relevant licensing bodies.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided in § 456.703 (b) and (c), the State plan must provide for a review of drug therapy before each prescription is filled or delivered to a beneficiary, and applicable State law (including State Board policy incorporated in the State law by reference) must establish standards for counseling of the beneficiary or the beneficiary's caregiver. The State must provide pharmacies with detailed information as to what they must do to comply with prospective DUR requirements, including guidelines on counseling, profiling, and documentation of prospective DUR activities by the pharmacists. The pharmacies, in turn, must provide this information to their pharmacists. This information is to be based on guidelines provided by this subpart and by other sources that the State may specify.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Point-of-sale or point-of-distribution review.</E> Except as provided in § 456.703 (b) and (c), the State plan must provide for point-of-sale or point-of-distribution review of drug therapy using predetermined standards before each prescription is filled or delivered to the beneficiary or the beneficiary's caregiver. The review must include screening to identify potential drug therapy problems of the following types:</P>
              <P>(1) Therapeutic duplication, that is, the prescribing and dispensing of two or more drugs from the same therapeutic class such that the combined daily dose puts the beneficiary at risk of an adverse medical result or incurs additional program costs without additional therapeutic benefit.</P>
              <P>(2) Drug-disease contraindication, that is, the potential for, or the occurrence of—</P>
              <P>(i) An undesirable alteration of the therapeutic effect of a given drug because of the presence, in the patient for whom it is prescribed, of a disease condition; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An adverse effect of the drug on the patient's disease condition.</P>
              <P>(3) Adverse drug-drug interaction, that is, the potential for, or occurrence of, a clinically significant adverse medical effect as a result of the beneficiary using two or more drugs together.</P>
              <P>(4) Incorrect drug dosage, that is, the dosage lies outside the daily dosage specified in predetermined standards as necessary to achieve therapeutic benefit. Dosage is the strength multiplied by the quantity dispensed divided by day's supply.</P>

              <P>(5) Incorrect duration of drug treatment, that is, the number of days of prescribed therapy exceeds or falls short of the recommendations contained in the predetermined standards.<PRTPAGE P="550"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Drug-allergy interactions, that is, the significant potential for, or the occurrence of, an allergic reaction as a result of drug therapy.</P>
              <P>(7) Clinical abuse/misuse, that is, the occurrence of situations referred to in the definitions of abuse, gross overuse, overutilization, and underutilization, as defined in § 456.702, and incorrect dosage and incorrect duration, as defined in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section, respectively.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Drug counseling.</E> (1) As part of the prospective drug review program, standards for counseling by pharmacists of beneficiaries or the beneficiaries' caregivers must be established by State law or other method that is satisfactory to the State agency. A State agency's counseling standards must address special situations where the patient or the patient's representative, is not readily available to receive the offer to counsel or the actual counseling, for example, prescriptions delivered offsite or through the mail. The State agency, at a minimum, must also address the following issues in their counseling standards:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether the offer to counsel is required for new prescriptions only, or for both new and refill prescriptions;</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether pharmacists must make the offer to counsel or auxiliary personnel are authorized to make the offer;</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether only a patient's refusal of the offer to counsel must be documented, or whether documentation of all offers is required;</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether documentation of counseling is required; and</P>
              <P>(v) Whether counseling is required in situations where the patient's representative is not readily available to receive a counseling offer or the counseling itself.</P>
              <P>(2) The standards must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) They must require pharmacists to offer to counsel (in person, whenever practicable, or through access to a telephone service that is toll-free for long-distance calls) each beneficiary or beneficiary's caregiver who presents a prescription. A pharmacist whose primary patient population is accessible through a local measured or toll-free exchange need not be required to offer toll-free service. Mail order pharmacies are required to provide toll-free telephone service for long distance calls.</P>
              <P>(ii) They need not require a pharmacist to provide consultation when a Medicaid beneficiary or the beneficiary's caregiver refuses that consultation.</P>
              <P>(iii) They must specify what documentation by the pharmacy of refusal of the offer of counseling is required.</P>
              <P>(3) The standards must specify that the counseling include those matters listed in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(viii) of this section that, in the exercise of his or her professional judgement (consistent with State law regarding the provision of such information), the pharmacist considers significant as well as other matters the pharmacist considers significant.</P>
              <P>(i) The name and description of the medication;</P>
              <P>(ii) The dosage form, dosage, route of administration, and duration of drug therapy;</P>
              <P>(iii) Special directions and precautions for preparation, administration, and use by the patient;</P>
              <P>(iv) Common severe side or adverse effects or interactions and therapeutic contraindications that may be encountered, including their avoidance, and the action required if they occur;</P>
              <P>(v) Techniques for self-monitoring drug therapy;</P>
              <P>(vi) Proper storage;</P>
              <P>(vii) Prescription refill information; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Action to be taken in the event of a missed dose.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Profiling.</E> The State agency must require that, in the case of Medicaid beneficiaries, the pharmacist make a reasonable effort to obtain, record, and maintain patient profiles containing, at a minimum, the information listed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Name, address, telephone number, date of birth (or age), and gender of the patient;</P>

              <P>(2) Individual history, if significant, including disease state or states, known allergies and drug reactions, and a comprehensive list of medications and relevant devices; and<PRTPAGE P="551"/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The State plan must provide for a retrospective DUR program for ongoing periodic examination (no less frequently than quarterly) of claims data and other records in order to identify patterns of fraud, abuse, gross overuse, or inappropriate or medically unnecessary care among physicians, pharmacists, and Medicaid beneficiaries, or associated with specific drugs or groups of drugs. This examination must involve pattern analysis, using predetermined standards, of physician prescribing practices, drug use by individual patients and, where appropriate, dispensing practices of pharmacies. This program must be provided through the State's mechanized drug claims processing and information retrieval systems approved by CMS (that is, the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS)) or an electronic drug claims processing system that is integrated with MMIS. States that do not have MMIS systems may use existing systems provided that the results of the examination of drug claims as described in this section are integrated within their existing system.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Electronic claims management system.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Point-of-sale system.</E> Each Medicaid agency, at its option, may establish, as its principal (but not necessarily exclusive) means of processing claims for covered outpatient drugs, a point-of-sale electronic claims management (ECM) system to perform on-line, real-time (that is, immediate) eligibility verifications, claims data capture, adjudication of claims, and to assist pharmacists and other authorized persons (including dispensing physicians) in applying for and receiving payment. The State determines who must participate in an ECM system and who may decline to do so. If the State exercises this option and wishes to receive FFP for its ECM system, the system must meet the functional and additional procurement and system requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Functional requirements.</E> The ECM system developed by the State must include at least the on-line, real-time capabilities specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The real-time requirement for prescriptions filled for nursing facilities and prescriptions filled by mail order dispensers may be waived by the State to permit claims to be processed in the batch mode at the end of the day or other time mutually agreed to by the nursing facility or mail order dispenser and Medicaid agency.</P>
              <P>(1) Eligibility verification, including identification of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Third-party payers.</P>
              <P>(ii) beneficiaries in managed care programs.</P>
              <P>(iii) beneficiaries and providers in restricted service programs (for example, lock-in and lock-out).</P>
              <P>(iv) Properly enrolled providers.</P>
              <P>(2) Claims data capture, including the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Transfer of claims information from the pharmacy to the Medicaid agency or the Medicaid agency's contractor.</P>
              <P>(ii) Identification of prescriber.</P>
              <P>(iii) Minimum data set (as defined in Part 11 of the State Medicaid Manual).</P>
              <P>(3) Claims adjudication, including the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Performing all edits and audits contained in the State's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) applicable to prescription drugs.</P>
              <P>(ii) Notifying the pharmacist (or other authorized person, such as the dispensing physician) about the claim status.</P>
              <P>(iii) Taking steps up to, but not including, payment of the claim.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional requirements.</E> In order to receive FFP for its ECM system, the State must meet the following requirements:</P>

              <P>(1) The ECM system must be acquired through applicable competitive procurement process in the State and must be the most cost-effective telecommunications network and automatic data processing services and equipment. The procurement must meet the procurement requirements <PRTPAGE P="555"/>set forth in 45 CFR part 75.326 through 75.340. The request for proposal (RFP) may be substituted for the advance planning and implementation documents otherwise required by part 433 of this chapter, 45 CFR 95.205, and 45 CFR part 307. A cost-benefit analysis must accompany the RFP. If in its advance planning document, a State establishes that a separate procurement is not cost-effective, modification of an existing fiscal agent contract will be acceptable. In this case, procurement of network services and equipment (but not software modifications) must be competitively procured.</P>
              <P>(2) States wishing to do prospective DUR as part of their ECM must do the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Submit a cost benefit analysis showing the cost-effectiveness of such a system. A State's decisions as to who must participate in the ECM system and who may decline to do so must be included in the cost-benefit analysis.</P>
              <P>(ii) Establish a central State-wide electronic repository for capturing, storing, and updating data for all prescriptions dispensed and for providing access to such data by all authorized participants.</P>
              <P>(iii) Design the system to assess data for a review of drug therapy before each prescription is filled or delivered to a Medicaid beneficiary. The type of review conducted must meet the requirements for prospective drug review set forth in § 456.705.</P>
              <P>(3) ECM is considered a subsystem and must be fully integrated with the remainder of the State's MMIS. In addition, information about ECM claims must be part of the single comprehensive utilization and management reporting system used by the DUR program.</P>

              <P>(a) For funds expended during calendar quarters in fiscal years 1991 and 1992 and attributable to the design, development, and implementation of an on-line, real-time claims management system (that is, the most cost-effective telecommunications network and automatic data processing services and equipment) that meets the requirements of § 456.722, FFP is available at a matching rate of 90 percent. After fiscal year 1992, ECM subsystems are funded at the standard applicable MMIS enhanced rates, subject to the requirements of part 433, subpart A of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) FFP is available at a matching rate of 75 percent for funds expended for the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Telecommunications equipment and other equipment to directly access MMIS files.</P>
              <P>(2) Telecommunications equipment (such as modems and point of sale terminals) furnished to providers.</P>
              <P>(3) Operational costs including telecommunications network costs, provided that the ECM system includes eligibility verification systems, electronic claims capture, claims adjudication (except for payment), and a claims data process that is integrated into a single comprehensive utilization and information reporting system.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholding of payment for failure to comply with Federal requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for withholding.</E> CMS withholds payments to the State, in whole or in part, only if, after giving the State notice, a reasonable opportunity for correction, and an opportunity for a hearing, the Administrator finds—</P>
              <P>(1) That the State plan is in substantial noncompliance with the requirements of Title XXI of the Act or the regulations in this part; or</P>
              <P>(2) That the State is conducting its program in substantial noncompliance with either the State plan or the requirements of Title XXI of the Act or the regulations in this part. (Hearings are generally not called until a reasonable effort has been made to resolve the issues through conferences and discussions. These efforts may be continued even if a date and place have been set for the hearing.)</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of this paragraph (a), substantial non-compliance includes, but is not limited to, failure to comply with requirements that significantly affect federal or state oversight or state reporting.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance of the plan.</E> A question of noncompliance of a State plan may arise from an unapprovable change in the approved State plan or the failure of the State to change its approved plan to conform to a new Federal requirement for approval of State plans.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Noncompliance in practice.</E> A question of noncompliance in practice may arise from the State's failure to actually comply with a Federal requirement, regardless of whether the plan itself complies with that requirement.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice, reasonable opportunity for correction, and implementation of withholding.</E> If the Administrator makes a finding of noncompliance under paragraph (a) of this section, the following steps apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Preliminary notice.</E> The Administrator provides a preliminary notice to the State—</P>
              <P>(i) Of the findings of noncompliance;</P>
              <P>(ii) The proposed enforcement actions to withhold payments; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If enforcement action is proposed, that the State has a reasonable opportunity for correction, described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, before the Administrator takes final action.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Opportunity for corrective action.</E> If enforcement actions are proposed, the State must submit evidence of corrective action related to the findings of noncompliance to the Administrator within 30 days from the date of the preliminary notification. Corrective action is action to ensure that the plan is, and will be, administered consistent with applicable law and regulations, to ameliorate past deficiencies in plan administration, or to ensure that enrollees will be treated equitably.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Final notice.</E> Taking into account any evidence submitted by the State under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Administrator makes a final determination related to the findings of noncompliance, and provides a final notice to the State—</P>
              <P>(i) Of the final determination on the findings of noncompliance;</P>
              <P>(ii) If enforcement action is appropriate—</P>
              <P>(A) No further payments will be made to the State (or that payments will be made only for those portions or aspects of the programs that are not affected by the noncompliance); and</P>
              <P>(B) The total or partial withholding will continue until the Administrator is satisfied that the State's plan and practice are, and will continue to be, in compliance with Federal requirements.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Hearing.</E> An opportunity for a hearing will be provided to the State prior to withholding under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</P>

              <P>(5) Withholding. CMS withholds payments, in whole or in part, until the <PRTPAGE P="570"/>Administrator is satisfied regarding the State's compliance.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Canceled (voided) check</E> means an CHIP check issued by a State or fiscal agent that prior to its being cashed is canceled (voided) by the State or fiscal agent, thus preventing disbursement of funds.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Fiscal agent</E> means an entity that processes or pays vendor claims for the CHIP agency.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Uncashed check</E> means an CHIP check issued by a State or fiscal agent that has not been cashed by the payee.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Warrant</E> means an order by which the CHIP agency or local agency without the authority to issue checks recognizes a claim. Presentation of a warrant by the payee to a State officer with authority to issue checks will result in release of funds due.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Refund of Federal financial participation (FFP) for uncashed checks</E>—(1) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> If a check remains uncashed beyond a period of 180 days from the date it was issued; that is, the date of the check, it is no longer regarded as an allowable program expenditure. If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of the uncashed check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.<PRTPAGE P="571"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Report of refund.</E> At the end of each calendar quarter, the State agency must identify those checks that remain uncashed beyond a period of 180 days after issuance. The CHIP agency must refund all FFP that it received for uncashed checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter. If an uncashed check is cashed after the refund is made, the State may file a claim. The claim will be considered to be an adjustment to the costs for the quarter in which the check was originally claimed. This claim will be paid if otherwise allowed by the Act and the regulations issued in accordance with the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) If the State does not refund the appropriate amount as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount will be disallowed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Refund of FFP for canceled (voided) checks</E>—(1) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> If the State has claimed and received FFP for the amount of a canceled (voided) check, it must refund the amount of FFP received.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Report of refund.</E> At the end of each calendar quarter, the CHIP agency must identify those checks that were canceled (voided). The State must refund all FFP that it received for canceled (voided) checks by adjusting the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for that quarter.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Aggregate lifetime dollar limit</E> means a dollar limitation on the total amount of specified benefits that may be paid under a State plan or a Managed Care Entity (MCE) (as defined at § 457.10) that contracts with the State plan. State plans must meet the requirements of § 457.480.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Annual dollar limit</E> means a dollar limitation on the total amount of specified benefits that may be paid in a 12-month period under a State plan or a MCE that contracts with a State plan. State plans must meet the requirements at § 457.480.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Cumulative financial requirements</E> are financial requirements that determine whether or to what extent benefits are provided based on accumulated amounts and include deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. (However, cumulative financial requirements do not include aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits because these two terms are excluded from the meaning of financial requirements.)</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefits</E> has the meaning defined in section 1905(r) of the Act and must be provided in accordance with section 1902(a)(43) of the Act.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Financial requirements</E> include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, or out-of-pocket maximums. Financial requirements do not include aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Medical/surgical benefits</E> means benefits for items or services for medical conditions or surgical procedures, as defined under the terms of the State plan in accordance with applicable Federal and State law, but does not include mental health or substance use disorder benefits. Any condition defined by the State plan as being or not being a medical/surgical condition must be defined to be consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice (for example, the most current version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or generally applicable State guidelines). Medical/surgical benefits include long term care services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Mental health benefits</E> means benefits for items or services that treat or otherwise address mental health conditions, as defined under the terms of the State plan in accordance with applicable Federal and State law, and consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice. Standards of current medical practice can be based on the most current version of the DSM, the most current version of the ICD, or generally applicable State guidelines. The term includes long term care services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">State Plan</E> has the meaning assigned at §§ 457.10 and 457.50.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Substance use disorder benefits</E> means benefits for items or services for substance use disorder, as defined under the terms of the State plan in accordance with applicable Federal and State law, and consistent with generally recognized independent standards of current medical practice. Standards of current medical practice can be based on the most current version of the DSM, the most current version of the ICD, or generally applicable State guidelines. The term includes long term care services.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Treatment limitations</E> include limits on benefits based on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, days in a waiting period, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of treatment. Treatment limitations include both quantitative treatment limitations, which are expressed numerically (such as 50 outpatient visits per year), and nonquantitative treatment limitations, which otherwise limit the scope or duration of benefits for treatment under the State plan. (<E T="03">See</E> paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section for an illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.) A permanent exclusion of all benefits for a particular condition or disorder, however, is not a treatment limitation for purposes of this definition.<PRTPAGE P="590"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">State plan providing EPSDT benefits.</E> (1) A State child health plan is deemed to be in compliance with this section if—</P>
              <P>(i) The State elects in the State child health plan to cover Secretary-approved coverage defined in § 457.450(a) that includes all EPSDT benefits, as defined in section 1905(r) of the Act, in accordance with the requirement applied under section 1905(r)(5) of the Act to provide necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described in section 1905(a) of the Act to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, as well as the informing and administrative requirements under 1902(a)(43) of the Act and the approved State Medicaid plan; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The State child health plan does not exclude EPSDT benefits for any particular condition, disorder, or diagnosis.</P>
              <P>(2) The child health plan must include a description of how the State will comply with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If a State has elected in its state plan to cover EPSDT benefits only for certain populations enrolled in the state child health plan, the State is deemed compliant with this section only with respect to such children.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Parity requirements for aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits.</E> This paragraph (c) details the application of the parity requirements for aggregate lifetime and annual dollar limits. A State plan that provides both medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits must comply with paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Plan with no limit or limits on less than one-third of all medical/surgical benefits.</E> If a State plan does not include an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on any medical/surgical benefits or includes an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit that applies to less than one-third of all medical/surgical benefits, it may not impose an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, respectively, on mental health or substance use disorder benefits.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">State plans with a limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.</E> If a State plan includes an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits, it must either—</P>
              <P>(i) Apply the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit both to the medical/surgical benefits to which the limit would otherwise apply and to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a manner that does not distinguish between the medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Not include an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is more restrictive than the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, respectively, on medical/surgical benefits. (For cumulative limits other than aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits, see paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section prohibiting separately accumulating cumulative financial requirements.)</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Determining one-third and two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (c), the determination of whether the portion of medical/surgical benefits subject to an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit represents one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits is based on the dollar amount of all plan payments for medical/surgical benefits expected to be paid under the State plan for the State plan year (or for the portion of the plan year after a change in plan benefits that affects the applicability of the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits). Any reasonable method may be used to determine whether the dollar amount expected to be paid under the State plan will constitute one-third or two-thirds of the dollar amount of all plan payments for medical/surgical benefits.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Plan not described in this section</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A State plan that is not described in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section for aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits on medical/surgical benefits, must either—</P>
              <P>(A) Impose no aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit, as appropriate, on mental health or substance use disorder benefits; or</P>

              <P>(B) Impose an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on mental health or <PRTPAGE P="591"/>substance use disorder benefits that is no more restrictive than an average limit calculated for medical/surgical benefits in the following manner. The average limit is calculated by taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits, as appropriate, that are applicable to the categories of medical/surgical benefits. Limits based on delivery systems, such as inpatient/outpatient treatment or normal treatment of common, low-cost conditions (such as treatment of normal births), do not constitute categories for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B). In addition, for purposes of determining weighted averages, any benefits that are not within a category that is subject to a separately-designated dollar limit under the plan are taken into account as a single separate category by using an estimate of the upper limit on the dollar amount that a plan may reasonably be expected to incur for such benefits, taking into account any other applicable restrictions under the plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Weighting.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), the weighting applicable to any category of medical/surgical benefits is determined in the manner set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section for determining one-third or two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations</E>—(1) <E T="03">Clarification of terms</E>—(i) <E T="03">Classification of benefits.</E> When reference is made in this paragraph (d) to a classification of benefits, the term “classification” means a classification as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</E> When reference is made in this paragraph (d) to a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, the reference to type means its nature. Different types of financial requirements include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums. Different types of quantitative treatment limitations include annual, episode, and lifetime day and visit limits. <E T="03">See</E> paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section for an illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Level of a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</E> When reference is made in this paragraph (d) to a level of a type of financial requirement or treatment limitation, level refers to the magnitude of the type of financial requirement or treatment limitation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">General parity requirement</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A State plan or a MCE that contracts with CHIP through its State plan that provides both medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits, including when such benefits are delivered through an MCE, may not apply any financial requirement or treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation of that type applied to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the same classification. Whether a financial requirement or treatment limitation is a predominant financial requirement or treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification is determined separately for each type of financial requirement or treatment limitation. The application of the rules of this paragraph (d)(2) to financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section; the application of the rules of this paragraph (d)(2) to nonquantitative treatment limitations is addressed in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Classifications of benefits used for applying rules.</E> If a State plan provides mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification of benefits described in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), mental health or substance use disorder benefits must be provided in every classification in which medical/surgical benefits are provided. In determining the classification in which a particular benefit belongs, the same reasonable standards must apply to medical/surgical benefits and to mental health or substance use disorder benefits. To the extent that a State plan provides benefits in a classification and imposes any separate financial requirement or treatment limitation (or separate level of a financial requirement or treatment limitation) for benefits in the classification, the rules of this <PRTPAGE P="592"/>paragraph (d) apply separately for that classification for all financial requirements or treatment limitations. The following classifications of benefits are the only classifications used in applying the rules of this paragraph (d):</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Inpatient.</E> Benefits furnished on an inpatient basis.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Outpatient.</E> Benefits furnished on an outpatient basis. See special rules for office visits in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Emergency care.</E> Benefits for emergency care.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Prescription drugs.</E> Benefits for prescription drugs. See special rules for multi-tiered prescription drug benefits in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations</E>—(i) <E T="03">Determining “substantially all” and “predominant”</E>—(A) <E T="03">Substantially all.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (d), a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation is considered to apply to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification of benefits if it applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in that classification. If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation does not apply to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, then that type cannot be applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in that classification.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Predominant.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) If a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification as determined under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the level of the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that is considered the predominant level of that type in a classification of benefits is the level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in that classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If, for a type of financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to at least two-thirds of all medical/surgical benefits in a classification, there is no single level that applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits in the classification subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation, the State plan (or health insurance issuer) may combine levels until the combination of levels applies to more than one-half of medical/surgical benefits subject to the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation in the classification. The least restrictive level within the combination is considered the predominant level of that type in the classification. (For this purpose, a State plan may combine the most restrictive levels first, with each less restrictive level added to the combination until the combination applies to more than one-half of the benefits subject to the financial requirement or treatment limitation.)</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Portion based on plan payments.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (d), the determination of the portion of medical/surgical benefits in a classification of benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation) is based on the dollar amount of all State plan payments and combinations of MCE payments for medical/surgical benefits in the classification expected to be paid under the plan or MCE or combination that contracts with the State plan for the plan year (or for the portion of the plan year after a change in plan benefits that affects the applicability of the financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Clarifications for certain threshold requirements.</E> For any deductible, the dollar amount of a State plan payments includes all plan payments for claims that would be subject to the deductible if it had not been satisfied. In accordance with the cumulative cost-sharing maximum in § 457.560, or any other out-of-pocket maximum in the State plan, the dollar amount of plan payments includes all State plan payments associated with out-of-pocket payments that are taken into account towards the out-of-pocket maximum as well as all plan payments associated with out-of-pocket payments that would have been made towards the out-of-pocket maximum if it had not been satisfied. Similar rules apply for any <PRTPAGE P="593"/>other thresholds at which the rate of health plan payment changes.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Determining the dollar amount of State plan payments.</E> Subject to paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section, any reasonable method may be used to determine the dollar amount expected to be paid under a State plan for medical/surgical benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (or subject to any level of a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Special rules</E>—(A)<E T="03"> Multi-tiered prescription drug benefits.</E> If a State plan applies different levels of financial requirements to different tiers of prescription drug benefits based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the rules in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section (relating to requirements for nonquantitative treatment limitations) and without regard to whether a drug is generally prescribed for medical/surgical benefits or for mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the health plan satisfies the parity requirements of this paragraph (d) for prescription drug benefits. Reasonable factors include cost, efficacy, generic versus brand name, and mail order versus pharmacy pick-up/delivery.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Sub-classifications permitted for office visits, separate from other outpatient services.</E> For purposes of applying the financial requirement and treatment limitation rules of this paragraph (d), a State plan may divide its benefits furnished on an outpatient basis into the two sub-classifications described in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B). After the sub-classifications are established, the State plan may not impose any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any sub-classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation that applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in the sub-classification using the methodology set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Sub-classifications other than these special rules, such as separate sub-classifications for generalists and specialists, are not permitted. The two sub-classifications permitted under this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) are:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Office visits (such as physician visits); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) All other outpatient items and services (such as outpatient surgery, facility charges for day treatment centers, laboratory charges, or other medical items).</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">No separate cumulative financial requirements.</E> A State plan may not apply any cumulative financial requirement for mental health or substance use disorder benefits in a classification that accumulates separately from any established for medical/surgical benefits in the same classification.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Nonquantitative treatment limitations</E>—(i) <E T="03">General rule.</E> A State plan may not impose a nonquantitative treatment limitation for mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification unless, under the terms of the CHIP State plan as written and in operation, any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the nonquantitative treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in the classification are comparable to, and are applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in applying the limitation for medical/surgical benefits in the classification.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Illustrative list of nonquantitative treatment limitations.</E> Nonquantitative treatment limitations include—</P>
              <P>(A) Medical management standards limiting or excluding benefits based on medical necessity or medical appropriateness, or based on whether the treatment is experimental or investigative;</P>
              <P>(B) Formulary design for prescription drugs;</P>
              <P>(C) For plans with multiple network tiers (such as preferred providers and participating providers), network tier design;</P>
              <P>(D) Standards for provider admission to participate in a network, including reimbursement rates;</P>

              <P>(G) Exclusions based on failure to complete a course of treatment;</P>
              <P>(H) Restrictions based on geographic location, facility type, provider specialty, and other criteria that limit the scope or duration of benefits for services provided under the plan or coverage; and</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General</E>—(1) State allotments for a fiscal year are determined by CMS for each State and the District of Columbia with an approved State child health plan, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, and for each Commonwealth and Territory, as described in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) In order to determine each State allotment, CMS determines the national total allotment amount for each fiscal year available to the 50 States and the District of Columbia, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the total allotment amount available for each fiscal year for allotment to the Commonwealths and Territories, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The amount of allotments redistributed under section 2104(f) of the Act will not be applied or taken into account in determining the amounts of a fiscal year allotment for a State and the District of Columbia under this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of Proportion.</E> As used in this section, <E T="03">proportion</E> means the amount of the allotment for a State or the District of Columbia for a fiscal year, divided by the national total allotment amount available for allotment to all States and the District of Columbia, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, for that fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">National total allotment amount for the 50 States and the District of Columbia.</E> (1) The national total allotment amount available for allotment to the 50 States and the District of Columbia is determined by subtracting the following amounts in the following order from the total appropriation specified in section 2104(a) of the Act for the fiscal year—</P>
              <P>(i) The total allotment amount available for allotment for each fiscal year to the Commonwealths and Territories, as determined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section;</P>

              <P>(B) There are two steps for determining the proportion for a State and the District of Columbia. The first step determines the preadjusted proportions, and is described under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The first step applies in determining the proportion for all fiscal years. The second step applies floors and ceilings and, if necessary, applies a reconciliation to the preadjusted proportion. The second step is described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The second step applies in determining the proportion only for FY 2000 and subsequent fiscal years. For FY 1998 and FY 1999, the preadjusted proportion is the State or District of Columbia's proportion for the fiscal year.</P>

For example, if the allotment for fiscal year 1998 has been fully expended, payments for expenditures claimed in fiscal year 1998 are carried over for application against the fiscal year 1999 allotment when it becomes available.</P>
              <P>(i) In accordance with § 457.618, the amount of non-primary expenditures that are within the 10 percent limit for the fiscal year for which they are claimed may be applied against a fiscal year allotment or allotments available in a subsequent fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(ii) In accordance with § 457.618, the amounts of non-primary expenditures that exceed the 10 percent limit for the fiscal year for which they are claimed may not be applied against a fiscal year allotment or allotments available in a subsequent fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(7) Carries over unexpended amounts of a State's allotment for a fiscal year for use in subsequent fiscal years through the end of the 3-year period of availability. For example, if the amounts of the fiscal year 1998 allotment are not fully expended by the end of fiscal year 1998, these amounts are carried over to fiscal year 1999 and are available to provide FFP for expenditures claimed by the State for that fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Amount of Federal payment for expenditures claimed.</E> The amount of the Federal payment for expenditures claimed by a State, District of Columbia, or the Commonwealths and Territories is determined by the enhanced FMAP applicable to the fiscal year in which the State paid the expenditure. For example, Federal payment for an expenditure paid by a State in fiscal year 1998 that was carried over to fiscal year 1999 (in accordance with paragraph (c)(6) of this section), because the State exceeded its fiscal year 1998 <PRTPAGE P="609"/>allotment, is available at the fiscal year 1998 enhanced FMAP rate.</P>

              <P>(1) For fiscal year 1998, a State must submit a budget request in an appropriate format for the 4 quarters of the fiscal year. CMS bases the grant awards for the 4 quarters of fiscal year 1998 based on the State's budget requests for those quarters.</P>
              <P>(2) For fiscal years after 1998, a State must submit a budget request in an appropriate format for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. CMS bases the grant awards for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year on the State's budget requests for those quarters.</P>
              <P>(3) For fiscal years after 1998, a State must also submit a budget request for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The amount of this quarter's grant award is based on the difference between a State's final allotment for the fiscal year, and the total of the grants for the first 3 quarters that were already issued in order to ensure that the total of all grant awards for the fiscal year are equal to the State's final allotment for that fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(4) The amount of the quarterly grant is determined on the basis of information submitted by the State (in quarterly estimate and quarterly expenditure reports) and other pertinent information. This information must be submitted by the State through the Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System (MBES) for the Medicaid program, and through the Child Health Budget and Expenditure System (CBES) for the title XXI program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quarterly estimates.</E> The Children's Health Insurance Program agency must submit Form CMS-21B (State Children's Health Insurance Program Budget Report for State Children's Health Insurance Program State expenditures) to the CMS central office (with a copy to the CMS regional office) 45 days before the beginning of each quarter.</P>

Central office staff considers the State's estimates, the regional office recommendations and any other relevant information, including any adjustments to be made under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and computes the grant.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Content of award.</E> The grant award computation form shows the estimate of expenditures for the ensuing quarter, and the amounts by which that estimate is increased or decreased because of an increase or overestimate for prior quarters, or for any of the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(i) Penalty reductions imposed by law.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of award.</E> The grant award authorizes the State to draw Federal funds as needed to pay the Federal share of disbursements.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Draw procedure.</E> The draw is through a commercial bank and the Federal Reserve system against a continuing letter of credit certified to the Secretary of the Treasury in favor of the State payee.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Availability of waiver.</E> The Secretary may waive the requirements of § 457.618 (the 10 percent limit on expenditures not used for health benefits coverage for targeted low-income children, that meets the requirements of § 457.410) in order to provide child health assistance to targeted low-income children under the State plan through a cost-effective, community-based health care delivery system, such as through contracts with health centers receiving funds under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act or <PRTPAGE P="620"/>with hospitals such as those that receive disproportionate share payment adjustments under section 1886(c)(5)(F) or section 1923 of the Act.</P>

              <P>(1) The coverage meets all of the requirements of this part, including subpart D and subpart E.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition.</E> For purposes of this subpart, “cost-effective” means that the State's cost of purchasing family coverage that includes coverage for targeted low-income children is equal to or less than the State's cost of obtaining coverage under the State plan only for the eligible targeted low-income children involved.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Cost comparisons.</E> A State may demonstrate cost-effectiveness by comparing the cost of coverage for the family to the cost of coverage only for the targeted low-income children under the health benefits package offered by the State under the State plan for which the child is eligible.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Individual or aggregate basis.</E> (1) The State may base its demonstration of the cost-effectiveness of family coverage on an assessment of the cost of family coverage for individual families, done on a case-by-case basis, or on the cost of family coverage in the aggregate.</P>
              <P>(2) The State must assess cost-effectiveness in its initial request for a waiver and then annually.</P>
              <P>(3) For any State that chooses the aggregate cost method, if an annual assessment of the cost-effectiveness of family coverage in the aggregate reveals that it is not cost-effective, the State must assess cost-effectiveness on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reports on family coverage.</E> A State with a waiver under this section must include in its annual report pursuant to § 457.750, the cost of family coverage purchased under the waiver, and the number of children and adults, respectively, covered under family coverage pursuant to the waiver.</P>

                <P>(e) The state must comply with the requirements related to medical loss ratios in accordance with the terms of § 438.74 of this chapter, except that the description of the reports received from the MCOs, PIHPs and PAHPs under § 438.8(k) of this chapter will be submitted independently, and not with the actuarial certification described in § 438.7 of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="625"/>

                <P>(ii) Maximize continuation of existing provider-beneficiary relationships. An “existing provider-beneficiary relationship” is one in which the provider was the main source of CHIP services for the beneficiary during the previous year. This may be established through State records of previous managed care <PRTPAGE P="626"/>enrollment or fee-for-service experience, encounter data, or through contact with the beneficiary.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the approach in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section is not possible, the State must distribute the beneficiaries equitably among the MCOs, PIHPs, PAHPs, PCCMs and PCCM entities.

                <P>(2) The State may consider additional reasonable criteria to conduct the default enrollment process, including the previous plan assignment of the beneficiary, quality assurance and improvement performance, procurement evaluation elements, accessibility of provider offices for people with disabilities (when appropriate), and other reasonable criteria that support the objectives of the managed care program.</P>
                <P>(3) The State must send a confirmation of the enrollee's managed care enrollment to the enrollee within 5 calendar days of the date such enrollment is processed by the State. The confirmation must clearly explain the enrollee's right to disenroll within 90 days from the effective date of the enrollment.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Priority for enrollment.</E> The state must have an enrollment system under which beneficiaries already enrolled in an MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity are given priority to continue that enrollment if the MCO, PIHP, PAHP, PCCM, or PCCM entity does not have the capacity to accept all those seeking enrollment under the program.</P>

Emergency services include inpatient and outpatient services that meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Are furnished by a qualified emergency services provider, other than the PACE organization or one of its contract providers, either in or out of the PACE organization's service area.</P>

              <P>(c) An emergency medical condition means a condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a prudent layperson, with an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Serious jeopardy to the health of the participant.</P>
              <P>(2) Serious impairment to bodily functions.</P>

              <P>(i) The services are preapproved by the PACE organization.</P>
              <P>(ii) The services are not preapproved by the PACE organization because the PACE organization did not respond to a request for approval within 1 hour after being contacted or cannot be contacted for approval.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section, the following definitions apply:</P>

              <P>(i) Post stabilization care means services provided subsequent to an <PRTPAGE P="652"/>emergency that a treating physician views as medically necessary after an emergency medical condition has been stabilized. They are not emergency services, which PACE organizations are obligated to cover. Rather, they are non-emergency services that the PACE organization should approve before they are provided outside the service area.</P>
              <P>(ii) Urgent care means the care provided to a PACE participant who is out of the PACE service area, and who believes their illness or injury is too severe to postpone treatment until they return to the service area, but their life or function is not in severe jeopardy.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Medicare payment to PACE organizations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Principle of payment.</E> Under a PACE program agreement, CMS makes a prospective monthly payment to the PACE organization of a capitation amount for each Medicare participant in a payment area based on the rate it pays to a Medicare Advantage organization.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of rate.</E> (1) The PACE program agreement specifies the methodology used to calculate the monthly capitation amount applicable to a PACE organization.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the monthly capitation amount is based on the Part A and Part B payment rates established for purposes of payment to Medicare Advantage organizations. As used in this section, “Medicare Advantage rates” means the Part A and Part B rates calculated by CMS for making payment to Medicare Advantage organizations under section 1853(c) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(3) CMS will adjust the monthly capitation payment amount derived under paragraph (b)(2) of this section based on a risk adjustment that reflects the individual's health status. CMS will ensure that payments take into account the comparative frailty of PACE enrollees relative to the general Medicare population.</P>
              <P>(4) For Medicare participants who require ESRD services, the monthly capitation amount is based on the Medicare Advantage ESRD risk adjustment model.</P>
              <P>(5) CMS may adjust the monthly capitation amount to take into account other factors CMS determines to be appropriate.</P>

              <P>(6) The monthly capitation payment is a fixed amount, regardless of <PRTPAGE P="666"/>changes in the participant's health status.</P>
              <P>(7) The monthly capitation payment amount is an all-inclusive payment for Medicare benefits provided to participants. A PACE organization must not seek any additional payment from Medicare. The only additional payment that a PACE organization may collect from, or on behalf of, a Medicare participant for PACE services is the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Any applicable premium amount specified in § 460.186.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any charge permitted under paragraph (d) of this section when Medicare is not the primary payer.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any payment from the State, as specified in § 460.182, for a participant who is eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.</P>
              <P>(iv) Payment with respect to any applicable spenddown liability under §§ 435.121 and 435.831 of this chapter and any amount due under the post-eligibility treatment of income process under § 460.184 for a participant who is eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.</P>
              <P>(8) CMS computes the Medicare monthly capitation payment amount under a PACE program agreement so that the total payment level for all participants is less than the projected payment under Medicare for a comparable population not enrolled under a PACE program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustments to payments.</E> If the actual number of Medicare participants differs from the estimated number of participants on which the amount of the prospective monthly payment was based, CMS adjusts subsequent monthly payments to account for the difference.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of Medicare secondary payer provisions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic rule.</E> CMS does not pay for services to the extent that Medicare is not the primary payer under part 411 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Responsibilities of the PACE organization.</E> The PACE organization must do the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify payers that are primary to Medicare under part 411 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine the amounts payable by those payers.</P>
              <P>(iii) Coordinate benefits to Medicare participants with the benefits of the primary payers.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Charges to other entities.</E> The PACE organization may charge other individuals or entities for PACE services covered under Medicare for which Medicare is not the primary payer, as specified in paragraphs (d)(4) and (5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Charge to other insurers or the participant.</E> If a Medicare participant receives from a PACE organization covered services that are also covered under State or Federal workers' compensation, any no-fault insurance, or any liability insurance policy or plan, including a self-insured plan, the PACE organization may charge any of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The insurance carrier, the employer, or any other entity that is liable for payment for the services under part 411 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Medicare participant, to the extent that he or she has been paid by the carrier, employer, or other entity.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Charge to group health plan (GHP) or large group health plan (LGHP).</E> If Medicare is not the primary payer for services that a PACE organization furnished to a Medicare participant who is covered under a GHP or LGHP, the organization may charge the following:</P>
              <P>(i) GHP or LGHP for those services.</P>
              <P>(ii) Medicare participant to the extent that he or she has been paid by the GHP or LGHP for those services.</P>

              <P>(a) Under a PACE program agreement, the State administering agency makes a prospective monthly payment to the PACE organization of a capitation amount for each Medicaid participant.</P>
              <P>(b) The monthly capitation amount is negotiated between the PACE organization and the State administering agency, and the amount, or the methodology used to calculate the amount, is specified in the PACE program agreement. The amount represents the following:</P>

              <P>(1) Is less than the amount that would otherwise have been paid under <PRTPAGE P="667"/>the State plan if the participants were not enrolled under the PACE program.</P>
              <P>(2) Takes into account the comparative frailty of PACE participants.</P>
              <P>(3) Is a fixed amount regardless of changes in the participant's health status.</P>
              <P>(4) Can be renegotiated on an annual basis.</P>
              <P>(c) The PACE organization must accept the capitation payment amount as payment in full for Medicaid participants and may not bill, charge, collect, or receive any other form of payment from the State administering agency or from, or on behalf of, the participant, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Payment with respect to any applicable spenddown liability under §§ 435.121 and 435.831 of this chapter and any amounts due under the post-eligibility treatment of income process under § 460.184.</P>
              <P>(2) Medicare payment received from CMS or from other payers, in accordance with § 460.180(d).</P>
              <P>(d) State procedures for the enrollment and disenrollment of participants in the State's system, including procedures for any adjustment to account for the difference between the estimated number of participants on which the prospective monthly payment was based and the actual number of participants in that month, are included in the PACE program agreement.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Medicare Parts A and B.</E> For a participant who is entitled to Medicare Part A, enrolled under Medicare Part B, but not eligible for Medicaid, the premium equals the Medicaid capitation amount.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Medicare Part A only.</E> For a participant who is entitled to Medicare Part A, not enrolled under Medicare Part B, and not eligible for Medicaid, the premium equals the Medicaid capitation amount plus the Medicare Part B capitation rate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Medicare Part B only.</E> For a participant who is enrolled only under Medicare Part B and not eligible for Medicaid, the premium equals the Medicaid capitation amount plus the Medicare Part A capitation rate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Medicaid, with or without Medicare.</E> A PACE organization may not charge a premium to a participant who is eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, or who is only eligible for Medicaid.</P>

                <P>(a) Every hospital seeking payment for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries must maintain a written agreement with a QIO operating in the area in which the hospital is located. These agreements must provide for the QIO review specified in § 476.71.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cooperation with QIOs.</E> Health care providers that submit Medicare claims must cooperate in the assumption and conduct of QIO review.</P>
                <P>(1) Providers must allocate adequate space to the QIO for its conduct of review at the times the QIO is conducting review.</P>
                <P>(2) Providers and practitioners must provide patient care data and other pertinent data to the QIO at the time the QIO is collecting review information that is required for the QIO to make its determinations. When the QIO does postadmission, preprocedure review, the provider must provide the necessary information before the procedure is performed, unless it must be performed on an emergency basis. Providers and practitioners must—</P>

                <P>(i) Except as provided under §§ 476.130(b) and 476.160(b), relating to beneficiary complaint reviews and general quality of care reviews, photocopy and deliver to the QIO all required information within 14 calendar days of a request. A QIO is authorized to require the receipt of the medical information earlier than the 14-day timeframe if the QIO makes a preliminary determination that the review involves a potential gross and flagrant or substantial violation as specified in part 1004 <PRTPAGE P="680"/>of this title and circumstances warrant earlier receipt of the medical information. A practitioner's or provider's failure to comply with the request for medical information within the established timeframe may result in the QIO taking action in accordance with § 476.90.</P>
                <P>(ii) Send secure transmission of an electronic version of medical information, if available, subject to the QIO's ability to support receipt and transmission of the electronic version. Providers and practitioners must deliver electronic versions of medical information within 14 calendar days of the request. A QIO is authorized to require the receipt of the medical information earlier than the 14-day timeframe if the QIO makes a preliminary determination that the review involves a potential gross and flagrant or substantial violation as specified in part 1004 of this title and circumstances warrant earlier receipt of the medical information. A practitioner's or provider's failure to comply with the request for medical information within the established timeframe may result in the QIO taking action in accordance with § 476.90.</P>
                <P>(3) Providers must inform Medicare beneficiaries at the time of admission, in writing, that the care for which Medicare payment is sought will be subject to QIO review and indicate the potential outcomes of that review. Furnishing this information to the patient does not constitute notice, under § 411.402(a) of this chapter, that can support a finding that the beneficiary knew the services were not covered.</P>
                <P>(4) When the provider has issued a written determination in accordance with § 412.42(c)(3) of this chapter that a beneficiary no longer requires inpatient hospital care, it must submit a copy of its determination to the QIO within 3 working days.</P>
                <P>(5) Providers must assure, in accordance with the provisions of their agreements with the QIO, that each case subject to preadmission review has been reviewed and approved by the QIO before admission to the hospital or a timely request has been made for QIO review.</P>
                <P>(6)(i) Providers must agree to accept financial liability for any admission subject to preadmission review that was not reviewed by the QIO and is subsequently determined to be inappropriate or not medically necessary.</P>
                <P>(ii) The provisions of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section do not apply if a provider, in accordance with its agreement with a QIO, makes a timely request for preadmission review and the QIO does not review the case timely. Cases of this type are subject to retrospective prepayment review under paragraph (b)(7) of this section.</P>
                <P>(7) Hospitals must agree that, if the hospital admits a case subject to preadmission review without certification, the case must receive retrospective prepayment review, according to the review priority established by the QIO.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Photocopying reimbursement methodology for prospective payment system providers.</E> Providers subject to the prospective payment system are paid for the photocopying costs that are directly attributable to the providers' responsibility to the QIOs to provide photocopies of requested provider records. The payment is in addition to payment already provided for these costs under other provisions of the Social Security Act and is based on a fixed amount per page as determined by CMS as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Step one.</E> CMS adds the annual salary of a photocopy machine operator and the costs of fringe benefits as determined in accordance with the principles set forth in OMB Circular A-76.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Step two.</E> CMS divides the amount determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the number of pages that can be reasonably expected to be made annually by the photocopy machine operator to establish the labor cost per page.</P>
                <P>(3) CMS adds to the per-page labor cost determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section the per-page costs of supplies.</P>

                <P>(4) CMS will periodically review the photocopy reimbursement rate to ensure that it still accurately reflects provider costs. CMS will publish any changes to the rate in a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> Reimbursement for the costs of photocopying and mailing records for QIO review is an additional <PRTPAGE P="681"/>payment to providers under the prospective payment system, as specified in § 412.115, § 413.355, and § 484.265 of this chapter. Thus, appeals concerning these costs are subject to the review process specified in part 405, subpart R of this chapter.</P>

                <P>(2) If CMS approves the agreement or the administrative procedures (after a finding by CMS as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), the QIO may begin to make determinations under its contract with CMS.</P>

However, with regard to determining the number of procedures selected for preadmission review, a QIO must use national admission norms.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of criteria.</E> In assessing the need for and appropriateness of an inpatient health care facility stay, a QIO must apply criteria to determine—</P>

                <P>(ii) Selecting norms to be used; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Developing review mechanisms for care furnished by their peers.</P>
                <P>(3) Ensure that an initial denial determination or a change as a result of DRG validation of services provided by a health care practitioner other than a physician is made by a physician only after consultation with a peer of that practitioner. Initial denial determinations and changes as a result of DRG validations must be made only by a physician or dentist.</P>

                <P>(2) The practitioners are precluded from performing review because they participated in the treatment of the patient, the patient is a relative, or the practitioners have a financial interest in the health care facility as described in § 466.98(d).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Peer involvement in quality review studies.</E> Practitioners must be involved in the design of quality review studies, development of criteria, and actual conduct of studies involving their peers.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Consultation with practitioners other than physicians.</E> To the extent practicable, a QIO must consult with nurses and other professional health care practitioners (other than physicians defined in 1861(r) (1) and (2) of the Act) and with representatives of institutional and noninstitutional providers and suppliers with respect to the QIO's responsibility for review.</P>

                <P>(1) A written complaint includes a complaint submitted electronically to the QIO.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of the QIO review.</E> In completing its review, the QIO shall consider any information and materials submitted by the Medicare beneficiary or his or her representative and any information submitted by the provider and/or practitioner. All information obtained by the QIO that fits within the definition of “confidential information” under § 480.101, will be held by the QIO as confidential.</P>
                <P>(1) The QIO's review will focus on the episode of care from which the complaint arose and address the specific concerns identified by the beneficiary and any additional concerns identified by the QIO. The QIO may separate concerns into different complaints if the QIO determine that the concerns relate to different episodes of care.</P>
                <P>(2) The QIO will use evidence-based standards of care to the maximum extent practicable. If no standard of care exists, the QIO will use available norms, best practices and established guidelines to establish the standard that will be used in completing the review. The QIO's determination regarding the standard used is not subject to appeal.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Medical information requests.</E> (1) Upon request by the QIO, a provider or practitioner must deliver all medical information requested in response to a Medicare beneficiary complaint within 14 calendar days of the request. A QIO is authorized to require the receipt of the medical information sooner if the QIO make a preliminary determination that the complaint involves a potential gross and flagrant or substantial quality of care concern as specified in part 1004 of this title and circumstances <PRTPAGE P="689"/>warrant earlier receipt of the medical information. A practitioner's or provider's failure to comply with the request for medical information within the established timeframe may result in the QIO taking action in accordance with § 476.90.</P>
                <P>(2) In requesting medical information in response to a Medicare beneficiary complaint, the QIO must notify the practitioner and/or provider that the medical record is being requested in response to a beneficiary complaint, explain the practitioner's and/or provider's right to discuss the QIO's interim initial determination, and request the name of a contact person in order to ensure timely completion of the discussion.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Interim initial determination.</E> The QIO peer reviewer will complete the review and the practitioner and/or provider will be notified of the interim initial determination within 10 calendar days of the receipt of all medical information.</P>
                <P>(1) A practitioner and provider will be notified by telephone of the opportunity to discuss the QIO's interim initial determination with the QIO in those situations where the peer reviewer determines that the quality of services does not meet professionally recognized standards of care for any concern in the complaint. The discussion must be held no later than 7 calendar days from the date of the initial offer.</P>
                <P>(2) The interim initial determination becomes the final initial determination if the discussion is not completed timely as a result of the practitioner's and/or provider's failure to respond.</P>
                <P>(3) Written statements in lieu of a discussion must be received no later than 7 calendar days from the date of the initial offer.</P>

                <P>(1) No later than 3 business days after completion of its review, or for cases in which the standard was not met, no later than 3 business days after the discussion or receipt of the provider's and/or practitioner's written statement, the QIO will notify (by telephone) the beneficiary and the provider/practitioner of its final initial determination and of the right to request a reconsideration of the QIO's final initial determination.</P>
                <P>(2) Written notice of the QIO's final initial determination will be forwarded to all parties within 5 calendar days after completion of its review, and must include:</P>
                <P>(i) A statement for each concern that care did or did not meet the standard of care;</P>
                <P>(ii) The standard identified by the QIO for each of the concerns; and</P>
                <P>(iii) A summary of the specific facts that the QIO determines are pertinent to its findings, including references to medical information and, if held, the discussion with the involved practitioner and/or provider.</P>

                <P>(2) The QIO's review will focus on all concerns identified by the QIO and/or identified by those who have referred or reported the concerns, with consideration being given to the episode of care related to the concerns.</P>
                <P>(3) The QIO will use evidence-based standards of care to the maximum extent practicable. If no standard of care exists, the QIO must use available norms, best practices, and established guidelines to establish the standard that will be used in completing the review. The QIO's determination regarding the standard used is not subject to appeal.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Medical information requests.</E> Upon request by the QIO, a provider or practitioner must deliver all medical information requested within 14 calendar days of the request. A QIO is authorized to require the receipt of the medical information sooner if the QIO makes a preliminary determination that the review involves a potential gross and flagrant or substantial quality of care concern and circumstances warrant earlier receipt of the medical information. A practitioner's or provider's failure to comply with the request for medical information within the established timeframe may result in the QIO taking action in accordance with § 476.90.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> The QIO peer reviewer will complete the review and the practitioner and/or provider will be <PRTPAGE P="691"/>notified of the initial determination in writing within 10 calendar days of the receipt of all medical information.</P>

                <P>(ii) The consequences to the individual of a refusal to sign the authorization when the refusal will render the QIO unable to carry out an activity.</P>
                <P>(4) The potential for information disclosed pursuant to the authorization to be subject to either appropriate or inappropriate redisclosure by a beneficiary, after which the information would no longer be protected by this subpart.</P>

                <P>(e) If a QIO seeks an authorization from a beneficiary for a use or disclosure of confidential information, the QIO must provide the beneficiary with a copy of the signed authorization.<PRTPAGE P="710"/>
