      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

      THIS TITLE
      Title 48—Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of seven volumes.

The contents of these volumes represent all current regulations codified under this title of the CFR as of October 1, 2019.

      The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal acquisition regulations.
      The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).
      The first volume, containing chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), includes an index to the Federal acquisition regulations.
      For this volume, Cheryl E. Sirofchuck was Chief Editor. The Code of Federal Regulations publication program is under the direction of John Hyrum Martinez, assisted by Stephen J. Frattini.

              301.101
              Purpose.
              (a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) establishes uniform HHS acquisition policies and procedures that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
              (b)(1) The HHSAR contains HHS policies that govern the acquisition process or otherwise control acquisition relationships between HHS' contracting activities and contractors. The HHSAR contains—
              (i) Requirements of law;
              (ii) HHS-wide policies;
              (iii) Deviations from FAR requirements; and
              (iv) Policies that have a significant effect beyond the internal procedures of HHS or a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.
              (2) Relevant internal procedures, guidance, and information not meeting the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are issued by HHS in other announcements, internal procedures, guidance, or information.

              301.401
              Deviations.
              Contracting officers are not permitted to deviate from the FAR or HHSAR without seeking proper approval. With full acknowledgement of FAR 1.102(d) regarding innovative approaches, any deviation to FAR or the HHSAR requires approval by the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE).

              301.602-3
              Ratification of unauthorized commitments.
              (b) Policy. (1) The Government is not bound by agreements with, or contractual commitments made to, prospective contractors by individuals who do not have delegated contracting authority. Unauthorized commitments do not follow the appropriate process for the expenditure of Government funds. Consequently, the Government may not be able to ratify certain actions, putting a contractor at risk for taking direction from a Federal official other than the contracting officer. See FAR 1.602-1. Government employees responsible for unauthorized commitments are subject to disciplinary action. Contractors perform at their own risk when accepting direction from unauthorized officials. Failure to follow statutory and regulatory processes for the expenditure of Government funds is a very serious matter.
              (2) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) is the official authorized to ratify an unauthorized commitment. No other re-delegations are authorized.
              (c) Limitations. (5) The HCA shall coordinate the request for ratification with the Office of General Counsel, General Law Division and submit a copy to the SPE.

              301.603-1
              General.
              (a) The Agency head has delegated broad authority to the Chief Acquisition Officer, who in turn has further delegated this authority to the SPE. The SPE has further delegated specific acquisition authority to the Operating and Staff Division heads and the HCAs. The HCA (non-delegable) shall select, appoint, and terminate the appointment of contracting officers.
              (b) To ensure proper control of redelegated acquisition authorities, HCAs shall maintain a file containing successive delegations of HCA authority through the contracting officer level.

              In accordance with HHS delegated acquisition authority, the FAR, this regulation, internal policies and guidance, the head of the contracting activity (non-delegable) shall establish review and approval procedures for proposed contract actions to ensure that—
              (a) Contractual documents are in conformance with law, established policies and procedures, and sound business practices;
              (b) Contract actions properly reflect the mutual understanding of the parties; and

              304.7200
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart implements Section 220 of Public Law 112-74, FY 2012 Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations Act, which requires, semi-annual reporting on the use of funds from the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), Public Law 111-148, sec. 4002. Contractors that receive awards (or modifications to existing awards) with a value of $25,000 or more funded, in whole or in part, from the PPHF, shall report information specified in the clause at 352.204-70, Prevention and Public Health Fund—Reporting Requirements, including, but not limited to—
              (a) The dollar amount of contractor invoices;
              (b) The supplies delivered and services performed; and
              (c) Specific information on subcontracts with a value of $25,000 or more.
            
            
              304.7201
              Procedures.
              (a) In any contract action funded in whole or in part by the PPHF, the contracting officer shall indicate that the contract action is being made under the PPHF, and indicate which products or services are funded under the PPHF. This requirement applies whenever PPHF funds are used, regardless of the contract instrument.
              (b) To maximize transparency of PPHF funds that shall be reported by the contractor, the contracting officer shall structure contract awards to allow for separately tracking PPHF funds. For example, the contracting officer may consider awarding dedicated separate contracts when using PPHF funds or establishing contract line item number structures to prevent commingling of PPHF funds with other funds.

              (c) Contracting officers shall ensure that the contractor complies with the reporting requirements of 352.204-70. Upon receipt of each report, the contracting officer shall review it for completeness, address any clarity or completeness issues with the contractor, and submit the final approved report in Section 508 compliant format to an Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs point-of-contact for posting on HHS' PPHF Web site at http://www.hhs.gov/open/prevention/index.html no later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period. If the contractor fails to comply with the reporting requirements, the contracting officer shall exercise appropriate contractual remedies.
              (d) The contracting officer shall make the contractor's failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the contractor's performance information under FAR subpart 42.15.
            
            
              
              304.7202
              Contract clause.
              Insert the clause at 352.204-70, Prevention and Public Health Fund—Reporting Requirements, in all solicitations and contract actions funded in whole or in part with PPHF funds, except classified solicitations and contracts. This includes, but is not limited to, awarding or modifying orders against existing or new contracts issued under FAR subparts 8.4 and 16.5 that will be funded with PPHF funds. Contracting officers shall include this clause in any existing contract or order that will be funded with PPHF funds. This clause is not required for any contract or order which contains a prior version of the clause at 352.204-70.

              311.7000
              Defining electronic and information technology requirements.
              The contracting officer shall ensure that requiring activities specify agency needs for electronic and information technology (EIT) supplies and services, and document market research, document EIT requirements, and identify the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. See FAR 11.002(f) and HHSAR subpart 339.2.
            
          
          
            Subpart 311.71—Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities.
            
              311.7100
              Policy.

              (a) It is HHS policy that all contractors comply with current and any future changes to 28 CFR part 36—Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities. For the purpose of this policy, accessibility is defined as both physical access to public accommodations and commercial facilities, and access to aids and services enabling individuals with sensory disabilities to fully participate in events in public accommodations and commercial facilities.
              (b) This policy applies to all contracts requiring contractors to conduct events in public accommodations and commercial facilities open to the public or involving HHS personnel, but not ad hoc meetings necessary or incidental to contract performance.
            
            
              311.7101
              Responsibilities.
              The contractor shall submit a plan assuring that any event held will meet or exceed the minimum accessibility standards set forth in 28 CFR part 36. A consolidated or master plan for contracts requiring numerous events in public accommodations and commercial facilities is acceptable.
            
            
              311.7102
              Contract clause.
              The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.211-1, Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities, in solicitations, contracts, and orders requiring the contractor to conduct events in accordance with 311.7100(b).
            
          
          
            Subpart 311.72—Conference Funding and Sponsorship
            
              311.7200
              Policy.
              HHS policy requires that all conferences the agency funds or sponsors shall: be consistent with HHS missions, objectives, and policies; represent an efficient and effective use of taxpayer funds; and withstand public scrutiny.
            
            
              311.7201
              Funding and sponsorship.
              Funding a conference through a HHS contract does not automatically imply HHS sponsorship, unless the conference is funded entirely by the agency. Also, HHS staff attendance or participation at a conference does not imply HHS conference sponsorship. Accordingly, for non-conference contracts funded entirely by HHS prior to a contractor claiming HHS sponsorship, the contractor must provide the contracting officer a written request for permission to designate HHS the conference sponsor. The OPDIV or STAFFDIV (operating division or staff division) head, or designee, shall approve such requests. The determination on what constitutes a “conference contract” or a “non-conference contract” shall be made by the contracting officer.
            
            
              311.7202
              Contract clause.
              To ensure that a contractor:
              (a) Properly requests approval to designate HHS the conference sponsor, where HHS is not the sole provider of conference funding; and
              (b) Includes an appropriate Federal funding disclosure and content disclaimer statement for conference materials, the contracting officer shall include the clause at 352.211-2, Conference Sponsorship Request and Conference Materials Disclaimer, in solicitations, contracts, and orders providing funding which partially or fully supports a conference.
            
          
          
            Subpart 311.73—Contractor Collection of Information
            
              311.7300
              Policy.

              In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), contractors shall not proceed with collecting information from surveys, questionnaires, or interviews until the COR obtains an Office of Management and Budget clearance and the contracting officer issues written approval to proceed. For any contract involving a requirement to collect or record information calling either for answers to identical questions from 10 or more persons other than Federal employees, or information from Federal employees which is outside the scope of their employment, for use by the Federal Government or disclosure to third parties, the contracting officer must comply with the PRA of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.).
            
            
              311.7301
              Contract clause.
              The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.211-3, Paperwork Reduction Act, in solicitations, contracts, and orders that require a contractor to collect the same information from 10 or more persons.

              (b) The statutes that require such review and implementing regulations are as follows: National Institutes of Health—42 U.S.C. 289a, Peer Review Requirements and 42 CFR part 52h, Scientific Peer Review of Research Grant Applications and Research and Development Contract Projects; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration—42 U.S.C. 290aa-3, Peer Review and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality—42 U.S.C. 299c-1, Peer review with respect to grants and contracts.

              Evaluation factors and significant subfactors.
              When acquiring electronic and information technology supplies and services (EIT) using negotiated procedures, contracting officers shall comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

              Proposal evaluation.
              (c) Use of non-Federal evaluators. (1) Except when peer review is required by statute as provided in 315.303-70(a), decisions to disclose proposals to non-Federal evaluators shall be made by the official responsible for appointing Source Selection Evaluation Team members in accordance with OPDIV procedures. The avoidance of organizational and personal conflicts of interest must be taken into consideration when making the decision to use non-Federal evaluators.
              
              (2) When a solicited proposal will be disclosed outside the Government to a contractor or a contractor employee for evaluation purposes, the following or similar conditions shall be part of the written agreement with the contractor prior to disclosure:
              CONDITIONS FOR EVALUATING PROPOSALS
              The contractor agrees that it and its employees, as well as any subcontractors and their employees (in these conditions, “evaluator”) will use the data (trade secrets, business data, and technical data) contained in the proposal for evaluation purposes only. The foregoing requirement does not apply to data obtained from another source without restriction. Any notice or legend placed on the proposal by either HHS or the offeror shall be applied to any reproduction or abstract provided to the evaluator or made by the evaluator. Upon completion of the evaluation, the evaluator shall return to the Government the furnished copy of the proposal or abstract, and all copies thereof, to the HHS office which initially furnished the proposal for evaluation. The evaluator shall not contact the offeror concerning any aspects of a proposal's contents.

              315.404-2
              Information to support proposal analysis.
              (a)(2) When some or all information sufficient to determine the reasonableness of the proposed cost or price is already available or can be obtained from the cognizant audit agency, or by other means including data obtained through market research (See FAR part 10 and HHSAR part 310) the contracting officer may request less-than-complete field pricing support (specifying in the request the information needed) or may waive in writing the requirement for audit and field pricing support by documenting the file to indicate what information will be used. When field-pricing support is required, contracting officers shall make the request through the HCA.

              Content of unsolicited proposals.
              (d) Warranty by offeror. To ensure against contacts between HHS personnel and prospective offerors that would exceed the limits of advance guidance set forth in FAR 15.604 and potentially result in an unfair advantage to an offeror, the prospective offeror of an unsolicited proposal must include the following warranty in any unsolicited proposal. Contracting officers receiving an unsolicited proposal without this warranty shall not process the proposal until the offeror is notified of the missing language and given an opportunity to submit a proper warranty. If no warranty is provided in a reasonable time, the contracting officer shall reject the unsolicited proposal, notify the offeror of the rejection, and document the actions in the file.
              UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL
              WARRANTY BY OFFEROR
              This is to warrant that—
              (a) This proposal has not been prepared under Government supervision;
              (b) The methods and approaches stated in the proposal were developed by this offeror;
              (c) Any contact with HHS personnel has been within the limits of appropriate advance guidance set forth in FAR 15.604; and,

              (d) No prior commitments were received from HHS personnel regarding acceptance of this proposal.
              
              
                Date:
                Organization:
                Name:
                Title:
              
              
              (This warranty shall be signed by a responsible management official of the proposing organization who is a person authorized to contractually obligate the organization.)
            
            
              315.606
              Agency procedures.
              (a) The HCA is responsible for establishing procedures to comply with FAR 15.606(a).

              (b) The HCA or designee shall be the point of contact for coordinating the receipt and processing of unsolicited proposals.
            
            
              315.606-1
              Receipt and initial review.
              (d) OPDIVs may consider an unsolicited proposal even though an organization initially submitted it as a grant application. However, OPDIVs shall not award contracts based on unsolicited proposals that have been rejected for grant awards due to lack of scientific merit.

              317.105-1
              Uses.
              (a) Each head of the contracting activity (HCA) determination to use multi-year contracting, as defined in FAR 17.103, is limited to individual acquisitions where the full estimated cancellation ceiling does not exceed 20 percent of the total contract value over the multi-year term or $12.5 million, whichever is less. Cancellation ceiling provisions shall conform to the requirements of FAR 17.106-1(c). The determination is not delegable and shall address the issues in FAR 17.105-1(a).
              (b)(1) SPE approval is required for any—
              (i) Individual determination to use multi-year contracting with a cancellation ceiling in excess of the limits in 317.105-1(a); or
              (ii) Class determination (see FAR subpart 1.7).
              (2) A determination involving a cancellation ceiling in excess of the limits in 317.105-1(a) shall present a well-documented justification for the estimated cancellation ceiling. When the estimated cancellation ceiling exceeds $12.5 million, the determination shall accompany a draft congressional notification letter pursuant to FAR 17.108 and 317.108.
            
            
              317.107
              Options.
              When included as part of a multi-year contract, use of options shall not extend the performance of the original requirement beyond 5 years. Options may serve as a means to acquire related services (severable or non-severable) and, upon their exercise, shall receive funding from the then-current fiscal year's appropriation.
            
            
              317.108
              Congressional notification.
              (a) The SPE shall give the approval of the written notification required by FAR 17.108(a).

              (2) Requests to exceed 5-year limitation. A request to exceed the 5-year limitation specified in FAR 17.204(e) must follow guidance in FAR Part 1.7.
              (3) Approval authority. All requests to exceed the 5-year limitations specified in FAR 17.204(e) must be supported with a Determination and Finding and approved by:
              (i) The HCA; and
              (ii) The HHS SPE.

              Applicability.
              It is HHS policy to include a solicitation provision and to include an evaluation factor for an offeror's Sustainable Action Plan when acquiring sustainable products and services. This applies only to new contracts and orders above the micro-purchase threshold. Such contracts and orders include, but are not limited to: Office supplies; construction, renovation or repair; building operations and maintenance; landscaping services; pest management; electronic equipment, including leasing; fleet maintenance; janitorial services; laundry services; cafeteria operations; and meetings and conference services. If using a product or service code designated for supplies or services having sustainable acquisition attributes but a review of the requirement determines that no opportunity exists to acquire sustainable acquisition supplies or services, document the determination in the contract file and make note in the solicitation.
            
            
              323.7102
              Procedures.
              (a) When required by the solicitation, offerors or quoters must include a Sustainable Acquisition Plan in their technical proposal addressing the environmental products and services for delivery under the resulting contract.
              (b) The contracting officer shall incorporate the final Sustainable Acquisition Plan into the contract.
              (c) The contracting officer shall ensure that sustainability is included as an evaluation factor in all applicable new contracts and orders when the acquisition utilizes a product or service code designated by HHS for supplies or services having sustainable acquisition attributes.
            
            
              323.7103
              Solicitation Provision.
              The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.223-71, Instruction to Offerors—Sustainable Acquisition, in solicitations above the micro-purchase threshold when the acquisition utilizes a product or service code designated by HHS as having sustainable acquisition attributes.

              324.103
              Procedures for the Privacy Act.
              (a) The contracting officer shall review all acquisition request documentation to determine whether the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) are applicable. The Privacy Act requirements apply when a contract or order requires the contractor to design, develop, or operate any Privacy Act system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function. When applicable, the contracting officer shall include the two Privacy Act clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 24.104 in the solicitation and contract or order. In addition, the contracting officer shall include the two FAR Privacy Act clauses, and other pertinent information specified in this subpart, in any modification which results in the Privacy Act requirements becoming applicable to a contract or order.
              (b) The contracting officer shall ensure that the statement of work or performance work statement (SOW or PWS) specifies the system(s) of records or proposed system(s) of records to which the Privacy Act and the implementing regulations are applicable or may be applicable. The contracting officer shall send the contractor a copy of 45 CFR part 5b, which includes the rules of conduct and other Privacy Act requirements.
              (c) The contracting officer shall ensure that the contract SOW or PWS specifies for both the Privacy Act and the Federal Records Act the disposition to be made of the system(s) of records upon completion of contract performance. The contract SOW or PWS may require the contractor to destroy the records, remove personal identifiers, or turn the records over to the contracting officer. If there is a legitimate need for a contractor to keep copies of the records after completion of a contract, the contractor must take measures, as approved by the contracting officer, to keep the records confidential and protect the individuals' privacy.

              (d) For any acquisition subject to Privacy Act requirements, the requiring activity prior to award shall prepare and have published in the Federal Register a “system notice,” describing the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) intent to establish a new system of records on individuals, to make modifications to an existing system, or to disclose information in regard to an existing system. The requiring activity shall attach a copy of the system notice to the acquisition plan or other acquisition request documentation. If a system notice is not attached, the contracting officer shall inquire about its status and shall obtain a copy from the requiring activity for inclusion in the contract file. If a notice for the system of records has not been published in the Federal Register, the contracting officer may proceed with the acquisition but shall not award the contract until the system notice is published and the contracting officer verifies its publication.
            
            
              324.104
              Restrictions on Contractor Access to Government or Third Party Information.
              The contracting officer shall establish the restrictions that govern the contractor employees' access to Government or third party information in order to protect the information from unauthorized use or disclosure.
            
            
              324.105
              Contract clauses.

              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.224-70, Privacy Act, in solicitations, contracts, and orders that require the design, development, or operation of a system of records to notify the contractor that it and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)) to the same extent as HHS employees. The clause also requires the contractor to ensure each of its employees knows the prescribed rules of conduct in 45 CFR part 5b and each contractor employee is aware that he or she is subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act. These requirements also apply to all subcontracts awarded under the contract or order that require the design, development, or operation of a system of records.
              (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.224-71, Confidential Information, in solicitations, contracts, and orders that require access to Government or to third party information.

              324.7000
              Scope of subpart.

              All individually identifiable health information that is Protected Health Information (PHI), as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 shall be administered in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) implementing regulations at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164 (the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules). The term “HIPAA” is used in this part to refer to title II, subtitle F of the HIPAA statute, at part C of title XI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320d et seq., section 264 of HIPAA, subtitle D of title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and regulations under such provisions.
            
            
              324.7001
              Policy on Compliance with HIPAA business associate contract requirements.
              (a) HHS is a HIPAA “covered entity” that is a “hybrid entity” as these terms are defined at sections 160.103 and 164.103 respectively. As such, only the portions of HHS that the Secretary has designated as “health care components” (HCC) as defined at section 164.103, are subject to HIPAA. HHS' HCCs may utilize persons or entities known as “business associates,” as defined at section 160.103. Generally, “business associate” means a “person” as defined by section 160.103 (including contractors, and third-party vendors, etc.) if or when the person or entity:
              (1) Creates, receives, maintains, or transmits “protected health information”, as the term is defined at section 160.103, on behalf of an HHS HCC to carry out HHS HIPAA “covered functions” as that term is defined at 164.103; or
              (2) Provides certain services to an HHS HCC that involve PHI.
              (b) Where the Department as a covered entity is required by 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1) and 164.504(e) and, if applicable, sections 164.308(b)(3) and 164.314(a), to enter into a HIPAA business associate contract, the relevant HCC contracting officer, acting on behalf of the Department, shall ensure that such contract meets the requirements at section 164.504(e)(2) and, if applicable, section 164.314(a)(2).

              326.501
              Statutory requirements.
              Any contract or subcontract pursuant to subchapter II, chapter 14, title 25 of the United States Code, the Act of April 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 596), as amended, or any other Act authorizing Federal contracts with or grants to Indian organizations or for the benefit of Indians, shall, to the greatest extent feasible, comply with section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, 88 Stat. 2205, 25 U.S.C. 450e(b) which provides preferences and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the administration of such contracts, and preference in the award of subcontracts in connection with the administration of such contracts to Indian organizations and to Indian-owned economic enterprises as defined in section 1452 of title 25, United States Code.
            
            
              326.502
              Definitions.
              For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:
              (a) Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian tribe. If the contractor has reason to doubt that a person seeking employment preference is an Indian, the contractor shall grant the preference but shall require the individual provide evidence within 30 days from the tribe concerned that the person is a member of the tribe.
              (b) Indian tribe means an Indian tribe, pueblo, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native Village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688, 43 U.S.C. 1601), which the United States recognizes as eligible for special programs and services because of its status as Indian.
              (c) Indian organization means the governing body of any Indian tribe, or entity established or recognized by such governing body, in accordance with the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77, 25 U.S.C. 1451).
              (d) Indian-owned economic enterprise means any Indian-owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of profit, provided that such Indian ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise, and the ownership shall encompass active operation and control of the enterprise.
              (e) Indian reservation includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688, 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).
              (f) On or near an Indian reservation means on a reservation or reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) where a person seeking employment could reasonably commute to and from in the course of a work day.
            
            
              326.503
              Compliance enforcement.
              The contracting officer shall promptly investigate and resolve written complaints of noncompliance with the requirements of the clauses at 352.226-1, Indian Preference and 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program filed with the contracting activity.
            
            
              326.504
              Tribal preference requirements.

              (a) When the contractor will perform work under a contract on an Indian reservation, the contracting officer may supplement the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program by adding specific Indian preference requirements of the tribe on whose reservation the contractor will work. The contracting activity and the tribe shall jointly develop supplemental requirements for the contract. Supplemental preference requirements shall represent a further implementation of the requirements of section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 and require the approval of the affected program director and the appropriate legal office, or a regional attorney, before the contracting officer adds them to a solicitation and resultant contract. Any supplemental preference requirements the contracting officer adds to the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program shall also clearly identify in the solicitation the additional requirements.
              (b) Nothing in this part shall preclude tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own tribal preference requirements. Such independently-developed tribal preference requirements shall not, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, become a requirement in contracts covered under this subpart, and shall not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement concerning the award and administration of contracts.
            
            
              326.505
              Applicability.

              The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.226-1, Indian Preference, and the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program, in contracts to implement section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 for all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) activities. Contracting activities shall use the clauses as follows, except for those exempted solicitations and contracts issued and or awarded pursuant to Title I of Public Law 93-638 (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.):
              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.226-1, Indian Preference, in solicitations, contracts, and orders when—
              (1) The award is (or will be) pursuant to an act specifically authorizing such awards with Indian organizations; or
              (2) The work is specifically for the benefit of Indians and is in addition to any incidental benefits which might otherwise accrue to the general public.
              (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program, in solicitations, contracts, and orders when—
              (1) The dollar amount of the acquisition is expected to equal or exceed $650,000 for non-construction work or $1.5 million for construction work;
              (2) The solicitation, contract, or order includes the Indian Preference clause; and
              (3) The contracting officer makes the determination, prior to solicitation, that performance will take place in whole or in substantial part on or near an Indian reservation(s). In addition, the contracting officer may insert the Indian Preference Program clause in solicitations, contracts, and orders below the $650,000 or $1.5 million level for non-construction or construction contracts, respectively, but which meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, and in the opinion of the contracting officer, offer substantial opportunities for Indian employment, training, and subcontracting.
            
          
          
            Subpart 326.6—Acquisitions Under the Buy Indian Act
            
              326.600
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart sets forth the policy on preferential acquisition from Indians under the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act. This subpart applies only to acquisitions made by or on behalf of Indian Health Service (IHS).
            
            
              326.601
              Policy.
              (a) IHS shall utilize the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act to give preference to Indians whenever authorized and practicable. The Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, prescribes the application of the advertising requirements of 41 U.S.C. 6101 to the acquisition of Indian supplies. As specified in 25 U.S.C. 47, the Buy Indian Act provides that, so far as practicable, the Government shall employ Indian labor and, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, purchase products of Indian industry (including, but not limited to printing, notwithstanding any other law) from the open market.
              (b) Due to the transfer of authority from the Department of the Interior to HHS, the Secretary of HHS may use the Buy Indian Act to acquire products of Indian industry in connection with the maintenance and operation of Indian hospital and health facilities, and for the overall conservation of Indian health. This authority is exclusively delegated to IHS and is not available for use by any other HHS component (unless that component makes an acquisition on behalf of IHS). However, the Buy Indian Act itself does not exempt IHS from meeting the statutorily mandated small business goals.
              (c) Subsequent legislation, particularly Public Law 94-437 and Public Law 96-537, emphasize using the Buy Indian Act negotiation authority.
            
            
              
              326.602
              Definitions.
              (a) Buy Indian contract means any contract involving activities covered by the Buy Indian Act and negotiated under the provisions of 41 U.S.C. 3104 and 25 U.S.C. 47 between an Indian firm and a contracting officer representing IHS.
              (b) Indian means a member of any tribe, pueblo, band, group, village, or community recognized by the Secretary of the Interior as being Indian or any individual or group of individuals recognized by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of HHS. The Secretary of HHS in making determinations may take into account the determination of the tribe with which affiliation is claimed.
              (c) Indian firm means a sole enterprise, partnership, corporation, or other type of business organization owned, controlled, and operated by:
              (1) One or more Indians (including, for the purpose of sections 301 and 302 of Public Law 94-437, former or currently federally recognized Indian tribes in the State of New York); or
              (2) By an Indian firm (as defined in paragraph (1) of this definition); or
              (3) A nonprofit firm organized for the benefit of Indians and controlled by Indians (see 326.601(a)).
              (d) Product of Indian industry means anything produced by Indians through either physical labor or intellectual effort involving the use and application of their skills. To classify as a product of Indian industry, the total cost of the item's production must equal or exceed 51 percent Indian effort.
            
            
              326.603
              Requirements.
              (a) Indian ownership. Indian ownership shall constitute at least 51 percent of an Indian firm during the period covered by a Buy Indian contract.
              (b) Joint ventures. An Indian firm may enter into a joint venture with other entities for specific projects as long as the Indian firm is the managing partner. However, the contracting officer shall approve the joint venture prior to the award of a contract under the Buy Indian Act.
              (c) Bonds. In the case of contracts for the construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings or public works, the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 3131 et seq.) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 28 require performance and payment bonds. Bonds are not required in the case of contracts with Indian tribes or public nonprofit organizations serving as governmental instrumentalities of an Indian tribe. However, bonds are required when dealing with private business entities owned by an Indian tribe or members of an Indian tribe. The contracting officer may require bonds of private business entities that are joint ventures with, or subcontractors of, an Indian tribe or a public nonprofit organization serving as a governmental instrumentality of an Indian tribe. A bid guarantee or bid bond is required only when a performance or payment bond is required.
              (d) Indian preference in employment, training and subcontracting. Contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act are subject to the requirements of section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 25 U.S.C. 450e, which requires giving preference to Indians in employment, training, and subcontracting. The contracting officer shall include the Indian Preference clause specified at 326.505(a) in all Buy Indian solicitations and resultant contracts. The contracting officer shall use the Indian Preference Program clause specified at 326.505(b). The contracting officer shall follow all requirements specified in subpart 326.2 which apply to a Buy Indian acquisition (e.g., 326.604 and 326.605).
              (e) Subcontracting. A contractor shall not subcontract more than 50 percent of the work under a prime contract awarded pursuant to the Buy Indian Act to non-Indian firms. For this purpose, contract work does not include the provision of materials, supplies, or equipment.
              (f) Wage rates.

              General.
              (b) The following requirements govern all solicitations and contracts using incremental funding, as appropriate:
              (1) The contracting officer shall consider the estimated total cost of the contract, including all planned increments of performance when determining the requirements that must be met before contract execution (e.g., Justification and Approvals, clearances, and approvals).

              (2) The solicitation and resultant contract shall include a statement of work or performance work statement that describes the total project, covers all proposed increments of performance, and contains a schedule of planned increments of performance. No funding increment may exceed 1 year, and the services rendered during each increment of performance must provide a specific material benefit that can stand alone if the remaining effort is not funded. The resultant contract shall also include the corresponding amount of funds planned for obligation for each increment of performance.
              (3) The contracting officer shall request that offerors respond to the solicitation with technical and cost proposals for the entire project, and shall require distinct technical and cost break-outs of the planned increments of performance.
              (4) Proposals shall be evaluated and any discussions and negotiations shall be conducted based upon the total project, including all planned increments of performance.
            
            
              332.703-71
              Incrementally funded cost-reimbursement contracts.
              Incremental funding may be used in cost-reimbursement contracts for severable services only when all of the following circumstances are present:
              (a) Funding of increments after the initial increment of performance is provided from the appropriation account available for obligation at that time;
              (b) The project represents a bona fide need of the fiscal year in which the contract is awarded and initially funded (i.e., the initial increment of performance) and is also a bona fide need of each subsequent fiscal year whose appropriation will be used; and
              (c) The project's significance provides reasonable assurance that subsequent year appropriations will be made available to fund the project's continuation and completion.
            
            
              332.703-72

              (a) The contracting officer shall insert substantially the following language in Section B: Supplies or Services and Prices or Costs, Table 1, in all cost-reimbursement contracts for severable services using incremental funding. The language requires the contracting officer to:
              (1) Insert the initial funding obligated by the award;
              (2) Identify the increment of performance covered by the funding provided; and
              (3) Specify the start and end dates for each increment of performance, as required by the “Limitation of Funds” clause at FAR 52.232-22.
              (b) Modification of the language is permitted to fit specific circumstances of the contract, including but not limited to language necessary to reflect the specific type of cost reimbursement contract awarded, but the language may not be omitted completely.

              Policy.
              The Department of Health and Human Services applies the earned value management system requirement as follows:
              (a) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $20 million or more, the contractor's earned value management system shall comply with the guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748).
              (b) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $50 million or more, the contractor shall have an earned value management system that has been determined by the cognizant Federal agency to be in compliance with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.
              (c) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at less than $20 million—
              (1) The application of earned value management is optional at the discretion of the program/project manager and is a risk-based decision that must be supported by a cost/benefit analysis; and
              (2) A decision to apply earned value management shall be documented in the contract file.
              (d) For firm-fixed-price contracts and subcontracts of any dollar value the application of earned value management is discouraged.

              (a) An IBR normally should be conducted as a post-award activity. A pre-award IBR may be conducted only if—
              (1) The acquisition plan contains documentation that demonstrates the need and rationale for a pre-award IBR, including an assessment of the impact on the source selection schedule and the expected benefits;
              (2) The use of a pre-award IBR is approved in writing by the head of the contracting activity prior to the issuance of the solicitation;
              (3) The source selection plan and solicitation specifically addresses how the results of a pre-award IBR will be used during source selection, including any weight to be given to it in source evaluation; and
              (4) Specific arrangements are made, and budget authority is provided, to compensate all offerors who prepare for or participate in a pre-award IBR; and the solicitation informs prospective offerors of the means for and conditions of such compensation.

            335.070-1
            Policy.

            (a) Contracting activities should encourage contractors to contribute to the cost of performing research and development (R&D), through the use of cost-sharing contracts, where there is a probability that the contractor will receive present or future benefits from participation as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.303. Examples include increased technical know-how, training for employees, acquisition of goods or services, development of a commercially viable product that can be sold in the commercial market and use of background knowledge in future contracts. Cost-sharing is intended to serve the mutual interests of the Government and its contractors by helping to ensure efficient utilization of the resources available for the conduct of R&D projects and by promoting sound planning and prudent fiscal policies of the contractor. The Government's interest includes positive impact on the community at large.
            (b) The contracting officer should use a cost-sharing contract for R&D contracts, unless the contracting officer determines that a request for cost-sharing would not be appropriate.
            (c) Any determination made by a contracting officer as described in this section shall be evidenced by appropriate documentation in the contract file.
          
          
            335.070-2
            Amount of cost-sharing.
            When cost-sharing is appropriate, the contracting officer shall use the following guidelines to determine the amount of cost participation by the contractor:
            (a) The amount of cost participation depends on the extent to which the R&D effort or results are likely to enhance the contractor's capability, expertise, or competitive position, and the value of this enhancement to the contractor. Therefore, contractor cost participation could reasonably range from as little as one percent or less of the total project cost to more than 50 percent of the total project cost. Ultimately, cost-sharing is a negotiable item. As such, the amount of cost-sharing shall be proportional to the anticipated value of the contractor's gain.
            (b) If the contractor will not acquire title to, or the right to use, inventions, patents, or technical information resulting from the R&D project, it is normally appropriate to obtain less cost-sharing than in cases in which the contractor acquires these rights.
            (c) If the R&D is expected to be of only minor value to the contractor, and if a statute does not require cost-sharing, it may be appropriate for the contractor to make a contribution in the form of a reduced fee or profit rather than sharing costs of the project. Alternatively, a limitation on indirect cost rates might be appropriate. See FAR 42.707. See also, FAR 16.303.
            (d) The contractor's participation may be considered over the total term of the project, so that a relatively high contribution in 1 year may be offset by a relatively low contribution in another. Care must be exercised that the intent to cost-share in future years does not become illusory. Redetermination of the cost sharing arrangement might be appropriate depending on future circumstances.
            (e) A relatively low degree of cost-sharing may be appropriate if an area of R&D requires special stimulus in the national interest.
          
          
            335.070-3
            Method of cost-sharing.
            Cost-sharing on individual contracts may be accomplished either by a contribution of part or all of one or more elements of allowable cost of the work being performed or by a fixed amount or stated percentage of the total allowable costs of the project. Contractors shall not charge costs contributed to the Government under any other instrument (e.g., grant or contract), including allocations to other instruments as part of any independent R&D program.

            335.072
            Key personnel.
            If the contracting officer determines that the personnel to be assigned to perform effort on an R&D contract are critical to the success of the R&D effort, or were a critical factor in the award of the contract, then the contracting officer should consider using the key personnel clause at 352.237-75, Key Personnel.

              Applicability.
              (a) Electronic and information technology (EIT) supplies and services must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (the Act) of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) Electronic and Information Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194). Requiring activities must consult with their Section 508 Official or designee to determine if the contractor should be responsible for compliance with EIT accessibility standards which apply to Web site content and communications material.
              (1) When conducting a procurement and employing the best value continuum, the solicitation shall include a separate technical evaluation factor developed by the contracting officer, requiring activity, and the Operating Division (OPDIV) Section 508 Official or designee.

              (2) At a minimum, solicitations for supplies and services shall require the submission of a Section 508 Product Assessment Template (See http://www.hhs.gov/web/508 for the template). Solicitations for services shall include any other pertinent information that the contracting officer deems necessary to evaluate the offeror's ability to meet the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards.
              (3) The HHS Operating Division or Staff Division (OPDIV or STAFFDIV) Section 508 Official or designee is responsible for providing technical assistance in development of Section 508 evaluation factors.
              (4) Before conducting negotiations or making an award, the contracting officer shall provide a summary of the Source Selection Evaluation Team's (SSET) assessment of offeror responses to the solicitation's Section 508 evaluation factor. This summary shall be submitted for review by the Section 508 Official or designee. The Section 508 Official or designee shall indicate approval or disapproval of the SSET assessment. The contracting officer shall coordinate the resolution of any issues raised by the Section 508 Official or designee with the chair of the SSET or requiring activity representative, as appropriate. The acquisition process shall not proceed until the Section 508 Official or designee approves the SSET assessment. The contracting officer shall include the assessment in the official contract file. See 339.204-1 regarding processing exception determination requests.

              (b) When acquiring commercial items, if no commercially available supplies or services meet all of the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, OPDIVs or STAFFDIVs shall, under the direction and approval of the Section 508 Official or designee, acquire the supplies and services that best meet the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. Process exception determinations for EIT supplies and services not meeting applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in accordance with 339.204-1.

              (b) In the development of an acquisition plan (AP) or other acquisition request document, the contracting officer shall ensure that all Section 508 exception determination requests for applicable EIT requirements are:
              (1) Documented and certified in accordance with the requirements of the HHS Section 508 policy;
              (2) Signed by the requestor in the requiring activity;
              (3) Certified and approved by the OPDIV Section 508 Official or designee; and
              (4) Included in the AP or other acquisition request document provided by the requiring activity to the contracting office.

              (c) For instances with an existing technical evaluation and no organization's proposed supplies or services meet all of the Section 508 accessibility standards; in order to proceed with the acquisition, the requiring activity shall provide an exception determination request along with the technical evaluation team's assessment of the Section 508 evaluation factor to the designated Section 508 Official or designee for review and approval or disapproval. The contracting officer shall include the Section 508 Official's or designee's approval or disapproval of the exception determination request in the official contract file and reference it, as appropriate, in all source selection documents. For further information, see HHS Section 508 Policy on http://www.hhs.gov/web/508.
            
            
              339.205
              Section 508 accessibility standards for contracts.
              (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794(d)), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Section 508), specifies the applicable accessibility standards for all new solicitations and new or existing contracts or orders, regardless of EIT dollar amount.
              (b) The requiring activity shall consult with the OPDIV or STAFFDIV Section 508 Official or designee, as necessary, to determine the applicability of Section 508, identify applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and resolve any related issues before forwarding a request to the contracting or procurement office for the acquisition of EIT supplies and services—including Web site content and communications material for which the contractor must meet EIT accessibility standards.
              (c) Based on those discussions, the requiring activity shall provide a statement in the AP (or other acquisition request document) for Section 508 applicability. See 307.105. If Section 508 applies to an acquisition, include the provision at 352.239-73, Electronic and Information Technology and Accessibility Notice, language in a separate, clearly designated, section of the statement of work or performance work statement, along with any additional information applicable to the acquisition's Section 508 accessibility standards (e.g., the list of applicable accessibility standards of the Access Board EIT Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194)). If an AP does not address Section 508 applicability and it appears an acquisition involves Section 508, or if the discussion of Section 508 applicability to the acquisition is inadequate or incomplete, the contracting officer shall request the requiring activity modify the AP accordingly.
              (d) Items provided incidental to contract administration are not subject to this section.
              (e) The OPDIV Section 508 Official or designee may, at his or her discretion, require review and approval of solicitations and contracts for EIT supplies and services.

                Conference Sponsorship Request and Conference Materials Disclaimer (DEC 2015)

                (b) Whether or not HHS is the conference sponsor, the Contractor shall include the following statement on conference materials, including promotional materials, agendas, and Web sites:

No plan, questionnaire, interview guide or other similar device for collecting information (whether repetitive or single time) may be used without the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) first providing clearance. Contractors and the Contracting Officer's Representative shall be guided by the provisions of 5 CFR part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public, and seek the advice of the HHS operating division or Office of the Secretary Reports Clearance Officer to determine the procedures for acquiring OMB clearance.
                (b) The Contractor shall not expend any funds or begin any data collection until the Contracting Officer provides the Contractor with written notification authorizing the expenditure of funds and the collection of data. The Contractor shall allow at least 120 days for OMB clearance. The Contracting Officer will consider excessive delays caused by the Government which arise out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor in accordance with the Excusable Delays or Default clause of this contract.
              
              (End of clause)

                (4) B&P costs do not include independent research and development (IR&D) costs covered by the following paragraph, or pre-award costs covered by paragraph 36 of Attachment B to OMB Circular A-122.

                (2) IR&D shall be allocated its proportionate share of indirect costs on the same basis as the allocation of indirect costs to sponsored research and development.
                (3) The cost of IR&D, including its proportionate share of indirect costs, is unallowable.

                Indian Preference Program (DEC 2015)
                (a) In addition to the requirements of the clause of this contract entitled “Indian Preference,” the Contractor agrees to establish and conduct an Indian preference program which will expand opportunities for Indians to receive preference for employment and training in connection with the work performed under this contract, and which will expand the opportunities for Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises to receive a preference in the awarding of subcontracts. In this connection, the Contractor shall perform the following:
                (1) Designate a liaison officer who will maintain liaison with the Government and the Tribe(s) on Indian preference matters; supervise compliance with the provisions of this clause; and administer the Contractor's Indian preference program.
                (2) Advise its recruitment sources in writing and include a statement in all employment advertisements that Indian applicants receive preference in employment and training incident to such employment.
                (3) Not more than 20 calendar days after award of the contract, post a written notice setting forth the Contractor's employment needs and related training opportunities in the tribal office of any reservations on or near the contract work location. The notice shall include the approximate numbers and types of employees needed; the approximate dates of employment; any experience or special skills required for employment; training opportunities available; and other pertinent information necessary to advise prospective employees of any other employment requirements. The Contractor shall also request the tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the Contractor will perform contract work to provide assistance filling its employment needs and training opportunities. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to contact regarding the posting of notices and requests for Tribal assistance.

                (4) Establish and conduct a subcontracting program which gives preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as subcontractors (including suppliers) under this contract. The Contractor shall give public notice of existing subcontracting opportunities and, to the extent feasible and consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, shall solicit bids or proposals from Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises only. The Contractor shall request assistance and information on Indian firms qualified as subcontractors (including suppliers) from the Tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the Contractor will perform contract work. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to contact regarding the request for assistance and information. Public notices and solicitations for existing subcontracting opportunities shall provide an equitable opportunity for Indian firms to submit bids or proposals by including—
                (i) A clear description of the supplies or services required, including quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules that facilitate the participation of Indian firms;
                (ii) A statement indicating that Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises will receive preference in accordance with section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638; 88 Stat. 2205; 25 U.S.C. 450e(b);
                (iii) Definitions for the terms “Indian organization” and “Indian-owned economic enterprise” prescribed under the “Indian Preference” clause of this contract;
                (iv) A statement that the bidder or offeror shall complete certifying that it is an Indian organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise; and
                (v) A closing date for receipt of bids or proposals which provides sufficient time for preparation and submission of a bid or proposal. If, after soliciting bids or proposals from Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, the Contractor receives no responsive bid or acceptable proposal, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the “Indian Preference” clause of this contract. If the Contractor receives one or more responsive bids or conforming proposals, the Contractor shall award the contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder or conforming offer from a responsible offeror if the price is reasonable. If the Contractor determines the low responsive bid or conforming proposal's price is unreasonable, the Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable price and award a subcontract. If parties cannot agree on a reasonable price, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the “Indian Preference” clause of this contract.
                (5) Maintain written records under this contract which demonstrate—
                (i) The numbers of Indians seeking employment for each employment position available under this contract;
                (ii) The number and types of positions filled by Indians and non-Indians;
                (iii) The total number of Indians employed under this contract;
                (iv) For those positions having both Indian and non-Indian applicants, and a non-Indian is selected for employment, the reason(s) why the Contractor did not select the Indian applicant;
                (v) Actions taken to give preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises for subcontracting opportunities which exist under this contract;
                (vi) Reasons why Indian subcontractors and or suppliers did not receive preference for each requirement where the Contractor determined that such preference was inconsistent with efficient contract performance; and
                (vii) The number of Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises contacted, and the number receiving subcontract awards under this contract.
                (6) Submit to the Contracting Officer for approval a quarterly report summarizing the Contractor's Indian preference program and indicating the number and types of available positions filled by Indians and non-Indians, and the dollar amounts of all subcontracts awarded to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and to all other firms.
                (7) Maintain records pursuant to this clause and keep them available for review by the Government for one year after final payment under this contract, or for such longer period in accordance with requirements of any other clause of this contract or by applicable law or regulation.
                (b) For purposes of this clause, the following definitions of terms shall apply:
                (1) The terms Indian, Indian tribe,
                  Indian organization, and Indian-owned economic enterprise are defined in the clause of this contract entitled Indian Preference.
                
                (2) Indian reservation includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)
                (3) On or near an Indian reservation means on a reservation or reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) where a person seeking employment could reasonably expect to commute to and from in the course of a work day.

                (c) Nothing in the requirements of this clause shall preclude Indian tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own Indian preference requirements. Such requirements must not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement dealing with the award and administration of contracts.
                
                (d) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in each subcontract awarded at any tier under this contract and to notify the Contracting Officer of such subcontracts.
                (e) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract in whole or in part or may pursue any other remedies authorized by law or by other provisions of the contract.

                (B) [Reserved]
                (ii) Disposition of Class 2 and 3 Subject Inventions. Class 2 Subject Inventions shall be governed by FAR clause 52.227-11, Patent Rights-Ownership (December 2007) (incorporated herein by reference). However, the Contractor shall grant a license in the Class 2 Subject Inventions to the provider of the Material or other party designated by the Agency as set forth in Alternate I.
                (iii) Class 3 Subject Inventions shall be governed by FAR clause 52.227-11, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Contractor (December 2007) (previously incorporated herein by reference).
                (3) Greater Rights Determinations. The Contractor, or an employee-inventor after consultation by the Agency with the Contractor, may request greater rights than are provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause in accordance with the procedures of FAR paragraph 27.304-1(c). In addition to the considerations set forth in paragraph 27.304-1(c), the Agency may consider whether granting the requested greater rights will interfere with rights of the Government or any Third party assignee or otherwise impede the ability of the Government or the Third party assignee to, for example, develop and commercialize new compounds, dosage forms, therapies, preventative measures, technologies, or other approaches with potential for the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of human diseases.
                A request for a determination of whether the Contractor or the employee-inventor is entitled to retain such greater rights must be submitted to the Agency Contracting Officer at the time of the first disclosure of the invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or not later than 8 months thereafter, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. Each determination of greater rights under this contract shall be subject to paragraph (c) of the FAR clause at 52.227-13 (incorporated herein by reference), and to any reservations and conditions deemed to be appropriate by the Agency such as the requirement to assign or exclusively license the rights to Subject Inventions to the Third party assignee.
                A determination by the Agency denying a request by the Contractor for greater rights in a Subject Invention may be appealed within 30 days of the date the Contractor is notified of the determination to an Agency official at a level above the individual who made the determination. If greater rights are granted, the Contractor must file a patent application on the invention. Upon request, the Contractor shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and patent number and issue date for any Subject Invention in any country for which the Contractor has retained title. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application file.
                (c) Invention disclosure by Contractor. The Contractor shall disclose in writing each Subject Invention to the Agency Contracting Officer and to the Director, Division of Extramural Inventions and Technology Resources (DEITR), if directed by the Contracting Officer, as provided in paragraph (j) of this clause within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the Agency Contracting Officer shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was Made and all inventors. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale (offer for sale), or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication, and if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure.
                In addition, after disclosure to the Agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the Contracting Officer and DEITR of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor. If the Contractor assigns a Subject Invention to the Third party assignee, then the Contractor and its employee inventors shall assist the Third party assignee in securing patent protection. All costs of securing the patent, including the cost of the Contractor's assistance, are at the Third party's expense. Any assistance provided by the Contractor and its employee inventors to the Third party assignee or other costs incurred in securing patent protection shall be solely at the Third party's expense and not billable to the contract.
                (d) Contractor action to protect the Third party assignee's and the Government's interest. (1) The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to the Agency all instruments necessary to: Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in Subject Inventions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this clause; convey title to a Third party assignee in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause; and enable the Third party assignee to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that Subject Invention.
                (2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each Subject Invention “Made” under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on Subject Inventions and to establish the Government's rights or a Third party assignee's rights in the Subject Inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
                (3) If the Contractor is granted greater rights, the Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States non-provisional patent application it files, and any patent issuing thereon, covering a Subject Invention the following statement: “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the Contract) awarded by (identify the specific Agency). The Government has certain rights in the invention.”
                (4) The Contractor agrees to provide a final invention statement and certification prior to the closeout of the contract listing all Subject Inventions or stating that there were none.
                (e) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor will include this clause in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work. At all tiers, the clause must be modified to identify the parties as follows: References to the Government are not changed, and the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause. The Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the contract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's Subject Inventions.
                (2) In subcontracts, at any tier, the Agency, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Agency with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of FAR clause 52.227-13.
                (f) Reporting on utilization of Subject Inventions in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor. The Contractor agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a Subject Invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees when a request under subparagraph b.3. has been granted by the Agency. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as the Agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the Agency in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the Agency in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the Agency agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.

                (g) Preference for United States industry in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any Subject Invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the Subject Invention or produced through the use of the Subject Invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by the Agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
                (h) March-in rights in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor. The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect to any Subject Invention in which it has acquired ownership through the exercise of the rights specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause, the Agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of Agency in effect on the date of contract award.
                (i) Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor. If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it shall:
                (1) Not assign rights to a Subject Invention in the United States without the written approval of the Agency, except where an assignment is made to an organization that has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided that the assignee shall be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;
                (2) Share royalties collected on a Subject Invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (but through their Agency if the Agency deems it appropriate) when the Subject Invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
                (3) Use the balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to Subject Inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of Subject Inventions for the support of scientific research or education;
                (4) Make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of Subject Inventions that are small business concerns, and give a preference to a small business concern when licensing a Subject Invention if the Contractor determines that the small business concern has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business concerns; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business concern has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor; and
                (5) Allow the Secretary of Commerce to review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this clause.
                (j) Communications. All invention disclosures and requests for greater rights shall be sent to the Agency Contracting Officer, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Additionally, a copy of all disclosures, confirmatory licenses to the Government, face page of the patent applications, waivers and other routine communications under this funding agreement at all tiers must be sent to:

For computer software, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license in such copyrighted computer software to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly (but not to distribute copies to the public) by or on behalf of the Government.
                (2) Data not first produced in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall not, without the prior written permission of the Contracting Officer, incorporate in data delivered under this contract any data not first produced in the performance of this contract unless the Contractor—
                (i) Identifies the data; and
                (ii) Grants to the Government, or acquires on its behalf, a license of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or, if such data are restricted computer software, the Government shall acquire a copyright license as set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of this clause (if included in this contract) or as otherwise provided in a collateral agreement incorporated in or made part of this contract.
                (3) Removal of copyright notices. The Government will not remove any authorized copyright notices placed on data pursuant to this paragraph (c), and will include such notices on all reproductions of the data.
                (d) Release, publication, and use of data. The Contractor shall have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, except—
                (1) As prohibited by Federal law or regulation (e.g., export control or national security laws or regulations);
                (2) As expressly set forth in this contract; or
                (3) If the Contractor receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of this contract that contain restrictive markings, the Contractor shall treat the data in accordance with such markings unless specifically authorized otherwise in writing by the Contracting Officer or in the following paragraphs.
                (4) In addition to any other provisions, set forth in this contract, the Contractor shall ensure that information concerning possible inventions made under this contract is not prematurely published thereby adversely affecting the ability to obtain patent protection on such inventions. Accordingly, the Contractor will provide the Contracting Officer a copy of any publication or other public disclosure relating to the work performed under this contract at least 30 days in advance of the disclosure. Upon the Contracting Officer's request the Contractor agrees to delay the public disclosure of such data or publication of a specified paper for a reasonable time specified by the Contracting Officer, not to exceed 6 months, to allow for the filing of domestic and international patent applications in accordance with Clause 352.227-11, Patent Rights—Exceptional Circumstances (abbreviated month and year of Final Rule publication).
                (5) Data on Material(s). The Contractor agrees that in accordance with paragraph (d)(2), proprietary data on Material(s) provided to the Contractor under or through this contract shall be used only for the purpose for which they were provided, including screening, evaluation or optimization and for no other purpose.
                (6) Confidentiality. (i) The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions to maintain Confidential Information as confidential, but no less than the steps Contractor takes to secure its own confidential information.
                (ii) Contractor shall maintain Confidential Information as confidential unless specifically authorized otherwise in writing by the Contracting Officer. Confidential Information includes/does not include [Government may define confidential information here.]
                (e) Unauthorized marking of data. (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract concerning inspection or acceptance, if any data delivered under this contract are marked with the notices specified in paragraph (g)(3) or (4) of this clause (if those alternate paragraphs are included in this clause), and use of the notices is not authorized by this clause, or if the data bears any other restrictive or limiting markings not authorized by this contract, the Contracting Officer may cancel or ignore the markings. However, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253d, the following procedures shall apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings.
                (i) The Contracting Officer will make written inquiry to the Contractor affording the Contractor 60 days from receipt of the inquiry to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings;
                (ii) If the Contractor fails to respond or fails to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the 60-day period (or a longer time approved in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown), the Government shall have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions.

                (iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor will be so notified in writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity, that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer will furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final Agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's decision. The Government will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination becoming final (in which instance the Government will thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.
                (2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with Agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request there under.
                (3) Except to the extent the Government's action occurs as the result of final disposition of the matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Contractor is not precluded by this paragraph (e) from bringing a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, that may arise as the result of the Government removing or ignoring authorized markings on data delivered under this contract.
                (f) Omitted or incorrect markings. (1) Data delivered to the Government without any restrictive markings shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. The Government is not liable for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.
                (2) If the unmarked data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Contractor may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer in writing for good cause shown) after delivery of the data, permission to have authorized notices placed on the data at the Contractor's expense. The Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Contractor—
                (i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied;
                (ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent;
                (iii) Establishes that the proposed notice is authorized; and
                (iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any data made prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice.
                (3) If data has been marked with an incorrect notice, the Contracting Officer may—
                (i) Permit correction of the notice at the Contractor's expense if the Contractor identifies the data and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized; or
                (ii) Correct any incorrect notices.
                (g) Protection of limited rights data and restricted computer software. (1) The Contractor may withhold from delivery qualifying limited rights data or restricted computer software that are not data identified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this clause. As a condition to this withholding, the Contractor shall—
                (i) Identify the data being withheld; and
                (ii) Furnish form, fit, and function data instead.
                (2) Limited rights data that are formatted as a computer database for delivery to the Government shall be treated as limited rights data and not restricted computer software.
                (3) [Reserved]
                (h) Subcontracting. The Contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government under this contract. If a subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government those rights, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the refusal and shall not proceed with the subcontract award without authorization in writing from the Contracting Officer.
                (i) Relationship to patents or other rights. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government.
              
              (End of clause)
              
                Alternate I (Sept 2014). As prescribed in HHSAR 327.409, substitute the following definition for “limited rights data” in paragraph (a) of the basic clause:
              
                Limited rights data means data, other than computer software, developed at private expense that embody trade secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.
              
                Alternate II (Sept 2014). As prescribed in HHSAR 327.409, insert the following paragraph (g)(3) in the basic clause:

              (g)(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the contract may identify and specify the delivery of limited rights data, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of limited rights data that has been withheld or would otherwise be entitled to be withheld. If delivery of that data is required, the Contractor shall affix the following “Limited Rights Notice” to the data and the Government will treat the data, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause, in accordance with the notice:

These data may be reproduced and used by the Government with the express limitation that they will not, without written permission of the Contractor, be used for purposes of manufacture nor disclosed outside the Government; except that the Government may disclose these data outside the Government for the following purposes, if any; provided that the Government makes such disclosure subject to prohibition against further use and disclosure: Agencies may list additional purposes or if none, so state.
                (b) This notice shall be marked on any reproduction of these data, in whole or in part.
              
              (End of notice)

If delivery of that computer software is required, the Contractor shall affix the following “Restricted Rights Notice” to the computer software and the Government will treat the computer software, subject to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause, in accordance with the notice:
              
                Restricted Rights Notice (SEPT 2014)
                (a) This computer software is submitted with restricted rights under Government Contract No. __ (and subcontract __, if appropriate). It may not be used, reproduced, or disclosed by the Government except as provided in paragraph (b) of this notice or as otherwise expressly stated in the contract.
                (b) This computer software may be—
                (1) Used or copied for use with the computer(s) for which it was acquired, including use at any Government installation to which the computer(s) may be transferred;
                (2) Used or copied for use with a backup computer if any computer for which it was acquired is inoperative;
                (3) Reproduced for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;
                (4) Modified, adapted, or combined with other computer software, provided that the modified, adapted, or combined portions of the derivative software incorporating any of the delivered, restricted computer software shall be subject to the same restricted rights;
                (5) Disclosed to and reproduced for use by support service Contractors or their subcontractors in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this notice; and
                (6) Used or copied for use with a replacement computer.
                (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this computer software is copyrighted computer software, it is licensed to the Government with the minimum rights set forth in paragraph (b) of this notice.
                (d) Any other rights or limitations regarding the use, duplication, or disclosure of this computer software are to be expressly stated in, or incorporated in, the contract.
                (e) This notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this computer software, in whole or in part.
              
              (End of notice)
              (ii) Where it is impractical to include the Restricted Rights Notice on restricted computer software, the following short-form notice may be used instead:
              
                Restricted Rights Notice Short Form (SEPT 2014)
                Use, reproduction, or disclosure is subject to restrictions set forth in Contract No. __ (and subcontract, if appropriate) with __ (name of Contractor and subcontractor).
              
              (End of notice)

              (iii) If restricted computer software is delivered with the copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401, it will be presumed to be licensed to the Government without disclosure prohibitions, with the minimum rights set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause.
              
              
                Alternate IV Sept 2014). As prescribed in HHSAR 327.409, substitute the following paragraph (c)(1) for paragraph (c)(1) of the basic clause:
              
                (c) Copyright—(1) Data first produced in the performance of the contract. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this contract, the Contractor may assert copyright in any data first produced in the performance of this contract. When asserting copyright, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402, and an acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number), to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. For data other than computer software, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. For computer software, the Contractor grants to the Government and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such computer software to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly (but not to distribute copies to the public), by or on behalf of the Government.
                
                  Alternate V (Sept 2014). As prescribed in HHSAR 327.409, add the following paragraph (j) to the basic clause:

When the Contractor whose data are to be inspected demonstrates to the Contracting Officer that there would be a possible conflict of interest if a particular representative made the inspection, the Contracting Officer shall designate an alternate inspector.
              
              (End of clause)

              Publications and Publicity.
              As prescribed in HHSAR 327.404-70, the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:
              
                Publications and Publicity (DEC 2015)
                (a) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the Contractor may publish the results of its work under this contract. The Contractor shall promptly send a copy of each article submitted for publication to the Contracting Officer's Representative. The Contractor shall also inform the Contracting Officer's Representative when the article or other publication is published, and furnish a copy of it as finally published.
                (b) Unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not display the HHS logo including Operating Division or Staff Division logos on any publications.
                (c) The Contractor shall not reference the product(s) or service(s) awarded under this contract in commercial advertising, as defined in FAR 31.205-1, in any manner which states or implies HHS approval or endorsement of the product(s) or service(s) provided.

              352.231-70
              Salary Rate Limitation.
              As prescribed in HHSAR 331.101-70(b), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:
              
                Salary Rate Limitation (DEC 2015)
                (a) The Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the Federal Executive Schedule Level II in effect on the date the funding was obligated.
                (b) For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms “direct salary,” “salary,” and “institutional base salary,” have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as “direct salary,” in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative costs). The salary rate limitation does not restrict the salary that an organization may pay an individual working under a Department of Health and Human Services contract or order; it merely limits the portion of that salary that may be paid with contract funds.
                (c) The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts.
                (d) If this is a multiple-year contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act used to fund this contract.
                (e) See the salaries and wages pay tables on the Office of Personnel Management Web site for Federal Executive Schedule salary levels.

              352.232-70
              Incremental Funding.
              As prescribed in HHSAR 332.706-2(b), the Contracting Officer shall insert the provision provided below in all solicitations when a cost-reimbursement contract for severable services using incremental funding is contemplated.
              
                Incremental Funding (DEC 2015)

                The Government intends to negotiate and award a cost-reimbursement contract using incremental funding as described in the clause at FAR 52.232-22, “Limitation of Funds”. The initial obligation of funds under the contract is expected to cover [insert the appropriate increment of performance]. The Government intends to obligate additional funds up to and including the full estimated cost of the contract for the remaining periods of performance by unilateral contract modification. However, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the total amount obligated, nor is the Contractor required to perform beyond the level supported by the total amount obligated.
              
              (End of provision)

              As prescribed in HHSAR 333.215-70(a), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:
              
                Choice of Law (Overseas) (DEC 2015)
                This contract shall be construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America. By the execution of this contract, the Contractor expressly agrees to waive any rights to invoke the jurisdiction of local national courts where this contract is performed and agrees to accept the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Federal Claims for hearing and determination of any and all disputes that may arise under the Disputes clause of this contract.

              Litigation and Claims.
              As prescribed in HHSAR 333.215-70(b), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following clause:
              
                Litigation and Claims (DEC 2015)
                (a) The Contractor shall provide written notification immediately to the Contracting Officer of any action, including any proceeding before an administrative agency, filed against the Contractor arising out of the performance of this contract, including, but not limited to the performance of any subcontract hereunder; and any claim against the Contractor the cost and expense of which is allowable under the clause entitled “Allowable Cost and Payment.”
                (b) Except as otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish immediately to the Contracting Officer copies of all pertinent documents received by the Contractor with respect to such action or claim. To the extent not in conflict with any applicable policy of insurance, the Contractor may, with the Contracting Officer's approval, settle any such action or claim. If required by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall effect an assignment and subrogation in favor of the Government of all the Contractor's rights and claims (except those against the Government) arising out of any such action or claim against the Contractor; and authorize representatives of the Government to settle or defend any such action or claim and to represent the Contractor in, or to take charge of, any action.
                (c) If the Government undertakes a settlement or defense of an action or claim, the Contractor shall furnish all reasonable assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense. Where an action against the Contractor is not covered by a policy of insurance, the Contractor shall, with the approval of the Contracting Officer, proceed with the defense of the action in good faith. The Government shall not be liable for the expense of defending any action or for any costs resulting from the loss thereof to the extent that the Contractor would have been compensated by insurance which was required by other terms or conditions of this contract, by law or regulation, or by written direction of the Contracting Officer, but which the Contractor failed to secure through its own fault or negligence. In any event, unless otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the Government shall not reimburse or indemnify the Contractor for any liability loss, cost, or expense, which the Contractor may incur or be subject to by reason of any loss, injury or damage, to the person or to real or personal property of any third parties as may accrue during, or arise from, the performance of this contract.

                (v) The successful Offeror's accepted proposal.
                (2) In the event of conflict or inconsistency between any of the requirements of the various portions of this contract, precedence shall be given in the following order:
                (i) Betterments: Any portions of the Offeror's proposal which exceed the requirements of the solicitation and which go beyond repair and improve the value of the property.
                (ii) The contract clauses and schedules included during the solicitation or at the time of award.
                (iii) All requirements (other than betterments) of the accepted proposal.

                (iv) Any design products, including but not limited to plans, specifications, engineering studies and analyses, shop drawings, equipment installation drawings, etc. These are “deliverables” under the contract and are not part of the contract itself.

                (2) Neither the Government's review, approval or acceptance of, nor payment for, the services required under this contract shall be construed to operate as a waiver of any rights under this contract or of any cause of action arising out of the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall be and remain liable to the Government in accordance with applicable law for all damages to the Government caused by the Contractor's negligent performance of any of these services furnished under this contract.

No construction may be started until the Government reviews the Final Design submission and determines it satisfactory for purposes of beginning construction. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor when the design is cleared for construction. The Government will not grant any time extension for any design resubmittal required when, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, the initial submission failed to meet the minimum quality requirements as set forth in the Contract.
                (2) If the Government allows the Contractor to proceed with limited construction based on pending minor revisions to the reviewed Final Design submission, no payment will be made for any completed or in-progress construction related to the pending revisions until they are completed, resubmitted, and are satisfactory to the Government.
                (3) No payment will be made for any completed or in-progress construction until all required submittals have been made, reviewed, and are satisfactory to the Government.
                (d) Constructor's role during design.

                (f) Payment for design under fixed-price design-build contracts. (1) The Contracting Officer may approve progress payments for work performed during the project design phase up to the maximum amount of __ (Contracting Officer to insert percent figure. If none stated, the amount is four (4) percent) percent of the contract price.
                (2) Contractor invoices for payment must be accompanied by satisfactory documentation supporting the amounts for which payments are requested. Progress payments approved by the Contracting Officer during the project design phase in no way constitute an acceptance of functional and aesthetic design elements nor acceptance of a final settlement amount in the event of a buy-out nor a waiver of any contractual requirements.
                (g) Unscheduled jobsite shutdowns. Due to security reasons during the life of this contract the Government may on an unscheduled basis require the contractor to shut down its jobsite for 2 days per year at no additional cost.

              Electronic Information and Technology Accessibility Notice.
              (a) As prescribed in HHSAR 339.203-70(a), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following provision:
              
                Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Notice (DEC 2015)
                (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

                (b) Accordingly, any offeror responding to this solicitation must comply with established HHS EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. The complete text of the Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards.

                (c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are stated in the clause at 352.239-74, Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility.

                In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT supplies meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must submit an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining whether proposed EIT supplies conform to applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows offerors or developers to self-evaluate their supplies and document—in detail—whether they conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard, and any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template are available under Section 508 policy on the HHS Web site http://www.hhs.gov/web/508.
                In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must provide enough information to assist the Government in determining that the EIT services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards, including any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues.

                (d) Respondents to this solicitation must identify any exception to Section 508 requirements. If a offeror claims its supplies or services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and it is later determined by the Government, i.e., after award of a contract or order, that supplies or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.

The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards.
                (b) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this contract or order are identified in the Statement of Work or Specification or Performance Work Statement. The contractor must provide any necessary updates to the submitted HHS Product Assessment Template(s) at the end of each contract or order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (see FAR 2.101) when the contract or order duration is one year or less. If it is determined by the Government that EIT supplies and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the contract, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.

                (c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this contract are:
                
                
                (Contract staff must list applicable standards)
                

                (d) In the event of a modification(s) to this contract or order, which adds new EIT supplies or services or revises the type of, or specifications for, supplies or services, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor submit a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template and any other additional information necessary to assist the Government in determining that the EIT supplies or services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Web site: (http://www.hhs.gov/web/508). If it is determined by the Government that EIT supplies and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the contract, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.

                (e) If this is an Indefinite Delivery contract, a Blanket Purchase Agreement or a Basic Ordering Agreement, the task/delivery order requests that include EIT supplies or services will define the specifications and accessibility standards for the order. In those cases, the Contractor may be required to provide a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template and any other additional information necessary to assist the Government in determining that the EIT supplies or services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. If it is determined by the Government that EIT supplies and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the provided documentation, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.

              Notice to Offerors, Protection of Human Subjects.
              As prescribed in HHSAR 370.303(a), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following provision:
              
                Notice to Offerors, Protection of Human Subjects (DEC 2015)

                (a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects, 45 CFR part 46, are available on the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) Web site at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/index.html.
                These regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in research activities supported or conducted by HHS.
                (b) The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data or identifiable public information through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. In most cases, the regulations extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human subjects. 45 CFR part 46 does not directly regulate the use of autopsy materials; instead, applicable state and local laws govern their use.

                (c) Activities which involve human subjects in one or more of the categories set forth in 45 CFR 46.101(b)(1)-(6) are exempt from complying with 45 CFR part 46. See http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html.
                (d) Inappropriate designations of the noninvolvement of human subjects or of exempt categories of research in a project may result in delays in the review of a proposal.

                (e) In accordance with 45 CFR part 46, offerors considered for award shall file an acceptable Federal-wide Assurance (FWA) of compliance with OHRP specifying review procedures and assigning responsibilities for the protection of human subjects. The FWA is the only type of assurance that OHRP accepts or approves. The initial and continuing review of a research project by an institutional review board shall ensure that: The risks to subjects are minimized; risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result; selection of subjects is equitable; and informed consent will be obtained and documented by methods that are adequate and appropriate. Depending on the nature of the research, additional requirements may apply; see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.111 for additional requirements regarding initial and continuing review. HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR part 46), information regarding OHRP registration and assurance requirements/processes, and OHRP contact information is available at the OHRP Web site (at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/index.html).
                (f) Offerors may consult with OHRP only for general advice or guidance concerning either regulatory requirements or ethical issues pertaining to research involving human subjects. ONLY the contracting officer may offer information concerning a solicitation.

            Subpart 370.3—Acquisitions Involving Human Subjects
            
              370.300
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart applies to all research activities conducted under contracts involving human subjects. See 45 CFR 46.102(d) and (f).
            
            
              370.301
              Policy.
              It is the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) policy that the contracting officer shall not award a contract involving human subjects until the prospective contractor provides assurance that the activity will undergo initial and continuing review by an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103. The contracting officer shall require a Federal-wide assurance (FWA), approved by the HHS Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), of each contractor, subcontractor, or institution engaged in human subjects research in performance of a contract. OHRP administers the assurance covering all HHS-supported or HHS-conducted activities involving human subjects.
            
            
              370.302
              Federal-wide Assurance (FWA).

              (a) OHRP-Approved FWAs are found at the following Web site: http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/search.aspx?styp=bsc.
              (b) Normally a contractor, subcontractor, or institution must provide approval of a FWA before a contract is awarded. If a contractor, subcontractor, or institution does not currently hold an approved FWA, it shall submit an explanation with its proposal and an FWA application prior to submitting a proposal. The contracting officer, on a case by case basis, may make award without an approved assurance in consultation with OHRP.

              (c) A contractor, subcontractor, or institution must submit all FWAs, including new FWAs, using the electronic submission system available through the OHRP Web site at http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile/, unless an institution lacks the ability to do so electronically. If an institution believes it lacks the ability to submit its FWA electronically, it must contact OHRP by telephone or email (see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/index.html) and explain why it is unable to submit its FWA electronically.
            
            
              370.303
              Notice to offerors.

              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-4a, Notice to Offerors, Protection of Human Subjects, in solicitations that involve human subjects. The contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I when the agency is prescribing a date later than the proposal submission by which the offeror must have an approved FWA.
              
              (b) Institutions having an OHRP-approved FWA shall certify IRB approval of submitted proposals in the manner required by instructions for completion of the contract proposal; by completion of an OMB Form No. 0990-0263, Protection of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB Certification/Declaration of Exemption (Common Rule); or by letter indicating the institution's OHRP-assigned FWA number, the date of IRB review and approval, and the type of review (convened or expedited). The date of IRB approval must not be more than 12 months prior to the deadline for proposal submission.
              (c) The contracting officer generally will not request FWAs for contractors, subcontractors, or institutions prior to selecting a contract proposal for negotiation. When a contractor submits an FWA, it provides certification for the initial contract period; no additional documentation is required. If the contract provides for additional years to complete the project, the contractor shall certify annually in the manner described in 370.303(b).
              (d) For the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-10, Notice to Offerors—Protection of Human Subjects, Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) Approval of Research Protocols Required, in solicitations that involve human subjects when the research is subject to RIHSC review and approval.
            
            
              370.304
              Contract clauses.
              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-4b, Protection of Human Subjects, in solicitations, contracts and orders involving human subjects.
              (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-6, Restriction on Use of Human Subjects, in contracts and orders if the contractor has an approved FWA of compliance in place, but cannot certify prior to award that an IRB registered with OHRP reviewed and approved the research, because definite plans for involvement of human subjects are not set forth in the proposal (e.g., projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds). Under these conditions, the contracting officer may make the award without the requisite certification, as long as the contracting officer includes appropriate conditions in the contract or order.
              (c) For FDA, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-11, Protection of Human Subjects, Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) Approval of Research Protocols Required, in contracts and orders that involve human subjects when the research is subject to RIHSC review and approval.
              (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-12, Needle Exchange, in solicitations, contracts, and orders involving human subjects.
              (e) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-13, Continued Ban on Funding Abortion and Continued Ban on Funding of Human Embryo Research, in solicitations, contracts, and orders involving human subjects.
            
          
          
            Subpart 370.4—Acquisitions Involving the Use of Laboratory Animals
            
              370.400
              Scope of subpart.

              This subpart applies to all research, research training, biological testing, housing and maintenance, and other activities involving live vertebrate animals conducted under contract. Additional information can be found in Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspolicylabanimals.pdf.
            
            
              370.401
              Policy.

              (a) It is HHS policy that contracting activities shall not award a contract involving live vertebrate animals until the Contractor provides acceptable assurance the contract work is subject to initial and continuing review by an appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) as described in the PHS Policy at IV.B.6 and 7. The contracting officer shall require an applicable Animal Welfare Assurance approved by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of each contractor, subcontractor, or institution having responsibility for animal care and use involved in performance of the contract. Normally the assurance shall be approved before award. The contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, may make award without an approved assurance in consultation with OLAW. For additional information see PHS Policy II., IV.A, and V.B.
              (b) The OLAW, NIH, is responsible for negotiating assurances covering all HHS/PHS-supported or HHS/PHS-conducted activities involving the care and use of live vertebrate animals. OLAW shall provide guidance to contracting officers regarding adequate animal care and use, approval, disapproval, restriction, or withdrawal of approval of assurances. For additional information see PHS Policy V.A.

              (c) If using live vertebrate animals, HHS policy requires that offerors address the points in the Vertebrate Animal Section (VAS) of the Technical Proposal. Each of the points must be addressed in the VAS portion of the Technical Proposal. For additional information see PHS Policy and use Contract Proposal VAS Worksheet. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm# InformationRequiredinApplications- ProposalsforAwardsSubmittedtoPHS and http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/VAScontracts.pdf.
            
            
              370.402
              Assurances.
              (a) Animal Welfare Assurances may be one of three types:
              (1) Domestic Assurance (DA). A DA describes the institution's animal care and use program, including but not limited to the lines of authority and responsibility, veterinary care, IACUC composition and procedures, occupational health and safety, training, facilities, and species housed. A DA listed in OLAW's list of institutions with an approved DA is acceptable for purposes of this policy.
              (2) Inter-institutional Assurance (IA). The offeror, its proposed subcontractor, or institution shall submit an IA when it does not have a proprietary animal care and use program, facilities to house animals or IACUC, and does not conduct animal research on-site. The offeror will perform the animal activity at an institution with an Animal Welfare Assurance named as a performance site. An IA approval extends to the full period of contract performance (up to 5 years) limited to the specific award or single project.
              (3) Foreign Assurance (FA). The Foreign Assurance is required for institutions outside the U.S. that receive PHS funds directly through a contract award. The Foreign Assurance also applies to institutions outside the U.S. that receive PHS funds indirectly (named as a performance site). An FA listed in OLAW's list of institutions with an approved FA is acceptable for purposes of this policy.

              (b) The contracting officer shall forward copies of proposals selected for negotiation and requiring an assurance to OLAW at olawdoa@od.nih.gov, as early as possible to secure the necessary assurances.
              (c) A contractor providing animal care services at an institution with an Animal Welfare Assurance, such as a Government-owned, Contractor-operated (GOCO) site, does not need a separate assurance. GOCO site assurances normally cover such contractor services.
            
            
              370.403
              Notice to offerors.
              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-5a, Notice to Offerors of Requirement for Compliance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, in solicitations involving live vertebrate animals.
              (b) Offerors having a DA on file with OLAW shall submit IACUC approval of the use of animals in the manner required by the solicitation, but prior to award. The date of IACUC approval must not be more than 36 months prior to award.
              (c) It is not necessary for offerors lacking an Animal Welfare Assurance to submit assurances or IACUC approval with proposals. OLAW shall contact contractors, subcontractors, and institutions to negotiate necessary assurances and verify IACUC approvals when requested by the contracting officer.
            
            
              370.404
              Contract clause.

              The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-5b, Care of Live Vertebrate Animals, in solicitations, contracts, and orders that involve live vertebrate animals.

            Subpart 370.7—Acquisitions Under the Leadership Act
            
              370.700
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart sets forth the acquisition requirements regarding implementation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) programs under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief as established by the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003, as amended (Pub. L. 108-25, Pub. L. 110-293, Pub. L. 113-56).
            
            
              370.701
              Solicitation provision.
              The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-9, Non-Discrimination for Conscience, in solicitations valued at more than the micro-purchase threshold:
              (a) In connection with the implementation of HIV/AIDS programs under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief established by the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003, as amended; or
              (b) Where the contractor will receive funding under the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003, as amended. In resolving any issues or complaints that offerors may raise regarding meeting the requirements specified in the provision, the contracting officer shall consult with the Office of Global Health Affairs, Office of the General Counsel, the Program Manager, and other HHS officials, as appropriate.

            Scope of part.
            This part presents basic policies and general information about the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Acquisition Regulation, subsequently referred to as the AGAR. The AGAR is an integral part of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System.
          
          
            Subpart 401.1—Purpose, Authority, Issuance
            
              401.101
              Purpose.
              (a) The AGAR provides for the codification and publication of uniform policies and procedures for acquisitions by contracting activities within USDA.
              (b) The purpose of the AGAR is to implement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), where further implementation is needed, and to supplement the FAR when coverage is needed for subject matter not covered in the FAR. The AGAR is not by itself a complete document, as it must be used in conjunction with the FAR.
            
            
              401.103
              Authority.
              The AGAR and amendments thereto are issued under 5 U.S.C. 301 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c). The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) has the delegated authority to promulgate Departmental acquisition regulations.
            
            
              401.104
              Applicability.
              The FAR and AGAR apply to all USDA acquisitions of supplies and services (including construction) which obligate appropriated funds, unless otherwise specified in this chapter or excepted by law.
            
            
              401.105
              Issuance.
            
            
              401.105-1
              Publication and code arrangement.

              (a) The AGAR is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as Chapter 4 of Title 48, Federal Acquisition Regulations System, to implement and supplement Chapter 1 which constitutes the FAR. Parts 400 through 499 have been assigned to USDA by the Office of the Federal Register.
              
              (b) The AGAR and its subsequent changes are published in:
              (1) Daily issues of the Federal Register,
              (2) Cumulative form in the CFR, and,
              (3) Electronic form on the USDA Departmental Administration Procurement Homepage (see 401.170).

              (c) Section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, provides an exception from the standard public rulemaking procedures to the extent that the rule involves a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. In 1971, Secretary of Agriculture Hardin announced a voluntary partial waiver from the Administrative Procedure Act exception, and USDA agencies generally are required to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment on proposed rules (36 FR 13804, July 24, 1971). The AGAR has been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance with the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. The USDA also is required to publish for public comment procurement regulations in the Federal Register, pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 418b), and FAR 1.301.

              401.105-2
              Arrangement of regulations.
              AGAR coverage parallels the FAR in format, arrangement, and numbering system. However, subdivisions below the section and subsection levels may not always correlate directly to FAR designated paragraphs and subparagraphs.

              Policy.

              (a) The SPE, subject to the authorities in 401.103 and FAR 1.301, may issue and publish Departmental regulations, that together with the FAR, constitute Department-wide policies, procedures, solicitation provisions, and contract clauses governing the contracting process or otherwise controlling the relationship between USDA (including any of its contracting activities) and contractors or prospective contractors.
              

              (b) Each designated head of a contracting activity (HCA) is authorized to issue or authorize the issuance of, at any organizational level, internal guidance which does not have a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the activity, or a significant cost or administrative impact on offerors or contractors. Internal guidance issued by contracting activities will not be published in the Federal Register. HCA's shall ensure that the guidance, procedures, or instructions issued—
              (1) Are consistent with the policies and procedures contained in this chapter;
              (2) Follow the format, arrangement, and numbering system of this chapter to the extent practicable;
              (3) Contain no material which duplicates, paraphrases, or is inconsistent with this chapter; and

              AGAR Advisories.
              The SPE may issue AGAR Advisories, consistent with the policies of the FAR and the AGAR, for the following purposes:
              (a) To communicate Department-wide policy and/or procedural guidance to contracting activities;
              (b) To delegate to procurement officials authority to make determinations or to take action to implement the policies of the FAR or the AGAR; and,
              (c) To establish internal policy and procedures on an interim basis, prior to incorporation in the AGAR or in a Departmental Directive.

              (d) AGAR Advisories are only available in electronic format on the USDA Procurement Web site at http://www.usda.gov/procurement/.

            Subpart 401.4—Deviations From the FAR and AGAR
            
              401.402
              Policy.
              Requests for authority to deviate from the provisions of the FAR or the AGAR shall be submitted in writing as far in advance as the exigencies of the situation will permit. Each request for deviation shall contain the following:
              (a) A statement of the deviation desired, including identification of the specific paragraph number(s) of the FAR and AGAR;
              (b) The reason why the deviation is considered necessary or would be in the best interest of the Government;
              (c) If applicable, the name of the contractor and identification of the contract affected;
              (d) A statement as to whether the deviation has been requested previously and, if so, circumstances of the previous request;
              (e) A description of the intended effect of the deviation;
              (f) A statement of the period of time for which the deviation is needed; and
              (g) Any pertinent background information which will contribute to a full understanding of the desired deviation.
            
            
              401.403
              Individual deviations.
              In individual cases, deviations from either the FAR or the AGAR will be authorized only when essential to effect a necessary acquisition or where special circumstances make such deviations clearly in the best interest of the Government. Except for cost principles, HCA's may approve individual deviations from the AGAR, after coordinating with the General Counsel and the SPE. No deviations from the FAR or AGAR may be authorized at the contracting office level. A copy of each deviation and its supporting documentation shall be provided to the SPE. Deviations from the FAR shall not be made unless such action is authorized by the SPE after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel and any other appropriate office, on the basis of a written justification stating clearly the special circumstances involved.
            
            
              401.404
              Class deviations.
              Where deviations from the FAR or AGAR are considered necessary for classes of contracts, requests for authority to deviate shall be submitted in writing to the SPE for approval. The SPE may authorize class deviations from the FAR without consulting the Chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council where urgency precludes consultation. The SPE shall subsequently inform the Chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council of the deviation including the circumstances under which it was required.
            
          
          
            Subpart 401.6—Contracting Authority and Responsibilities
            
              401.601
              General.
              (a) The authority and responsibility vested in the Secretary to manage USDA's acquisition function is delegated through the Assistant Secretary for Administration to the SPE. This broad authority includes, but is not limited to, the following responsibilities:
              (1) Prescribing and publishing Departmental acquisition policies, regulations, and procedures.
              (2) Taking any necessary actions consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures with respect to purchases, contracts, leases, and other transactions.
              (3) Designating contracting officers.
              (4) Establishing clear lines of contracting authority.

              (5) Evaluating and monitoring the performance of USDA's acquisition system.
              
              (6) Managing and enhancing career development of the contracting work force.
              (7) Participating in the development of Government-wide acquisition policies, regulations, and standards; and determining specific areas where government-wide performance standards should be established and applied.
              (8) Determining areas of Department-unique standards and developing unique Department-wide standards.
              (9) Certifying to the Secretary that the acquisition system meets approved standards.
              (b) The SPE may delegate contracting authority to the Heads of Contracting Activities (HCA's) and the responsibility to manage their acquisition function.
              (c) Unless prohibited by the FAR, the AGAR, or by other applicable statutes and regulations, the SPE may redelegate to HCA's the authority to make determinations as the agency head in order to implement the policies and procedures of the FAR. Such delegations shall be in writing, but need not be published.
              (d) Unless prohibited by the FAR, the AGAR, or by other applicable statutes or regulations, each HCA may designate one individual from the contracting activity to carry out the functions of the HCA (HCAD). The HCAD may exercise all authority delegated to the HCA.

              401.602-3
              Ratification of unauthorized commitments.
              (a) Definitions. Ratification, as used in this section, means the signed, documented action taken by an authorized official to approve and sanction a previously unauthorized commitment.
              
                Unauthorized commitment, as used in this section, means an agreement made by a Government representative who lacked the authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the Government.
              (b) Policy. The HCA may delegate ratification authority to the chief of the contracting office.
              (c) Procedure. Whenever an official of the cognizant contracting activity who is authorized to ratify unauthorized commitments learns that a person or firm has assumed work as a result of an unauthorized commitment, that official shall take the following actions:
              (1) Immediately inform any person who is performing work as a result of an unauthorized commitment that the work is being performed at that person's risk;
              (2) Inform the individual who made the unauthorized commitment of the seriousness of the act and the possible consequences;
              (3) Ensure that the individual who made the unauthorized commitment furnishes all records and documents concerning the commitment and a complete, written statement of facts, including, but not limited to: a statement as to why a contracting officer was not used; why the vendor was selected and a list of sources considered; a description of work to be performed or products to be furnished; the estimated or agreed price; whether an appropriation is available for the work; and whether performance has begun. Under exceptional circumstances, such as when the individual who made the unauthorized commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, the ratifying official may waive these requirements; and
              (4) Decide whether ratification is proper and proceed as follows:
              (i) If ratification is not justifiable, provide the cognizant program office, contracting office, and the unauthorized contractor with an explanation of the decision not to ratify.
              (ii) If ratification appears adequately justified, ratify the action and retain or assign the contract to a successor contracting officer if necessary.
              (iii) Maintain related approval, decisional, and background documents in the contract file for audit purposes.
              (iv) Notify the cognizant program supervisor or line officer about the final disposition of the case; the notification may include a recommendation that the unauthorized commitment should be further considered a violation of USDA's employee conduct regulations.

                Debarring official. Pursuant to the Secretary's delegations of authority in 7 CFR 2.24, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) is designated as the debarring official (Department Debarring Officer) with the following exceptions:
              (a) For commodity contracts awarded on behalf of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the Executive Vice President, CCC, or his designee is designated as the debarring official pursuant to 7 CFR part 1407.
              (b) For contracts awarded under the School Lunch and Surplus Removal Programs (42 U.S.C. 1755 and 7 U.S.C. 612c), the Department Debarring Officer has delegated debarring authority to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).

              List of parties excluded from Federal procurement and nonprocurement programs.
              The Department Debarring Officer is USDA's single point of contact with GSA for debarment and suspension actions taken under this subpart. The debarring official for AMS shall notify the Department Debarring Officer of each debarment and suspension action by promptly submitting a copy of the debarment or suspension notice and any later changes to the debarment or suspension status. The Department Debarring Officer will forward a copy of each notice to GSA for inclusion in the Government-wide list.
            
            
              409.405
              Effect of listing.
              Compelling reasons are considered to be present where failure to contract with the debarred or suspended contractor would seriously harm the agency's programs and prevent accomplishment of mission requirements. The SPE is authorized to make the determinations under FAR 9.405. Requests for such determinations shall be submitted through the head of the contracting activity (HCA) to the SPE.
            
            
              409.405-1

              409.406-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. When a contracting officer becomes aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be sufficient cause for debarment, the case shall be immediately referred through the HCA to the debarring official. The case must be accompanied by a complete statement of the facts (including a copy of any criminal indictments, if applicable) along with a recommendation for action. Where the statement of facts indicates the irregularities to be possible criminal offenses, or for any other reason further investigation is considered necessary, the matter shall be referred to the HCA who should consult with the Office of Inspector General to determine if further investigation is required prior to referring to the debarring official.
              (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations and consulting with the Office of Inspector General and Office of the General Counsel, as appropriate, the debarring official determines debarment is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the proposed debarment in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and notify the HCA of the action taken.
              (c) Fact-finding proceeding. For actions listed under FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an informal hearing. The hearing should be held at a location and time that is convenient to the parties concerned, if at all possible. The contractor and any specifically named affiliates may be represented by counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in such a manner that each party will have an opportunity to present all information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment. The contractor shall be provided a copy of a transcript of the proceedings under the conditions established in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2)(ii).

              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. When a contracting officer becomes aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be sufficient cause for suspension, the case shall be immediately referred through the HCA to the debarring official. The case must be accompanied by a complete statement of the facts along with a recommendation for action. Where the statement of facts indicates the irregularities to be possible criminal offenses, or for any other reason further investigation is considered necessary, the matter shall be referred to the HCA who should consult with the Office of Inspector General to determine if further investigation is required prior to referring it to the debarring official.
              (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations and consulting with the Office of Inspector General and Office of the General Counsel, as appropriate, the debarring official determines suspension is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the proposed suspension in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c) and notify the HCA of the action taken.
              (c) Fact-finding proceedings. For actions listed under FAR 9.407-3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an informal hearing, similar in nature to the hearing for debarments as discussed in 409.406-3(c).

              Waiver.
              (a) The HCA, on a non-delegable basis, is authorized to waive any general rule or procedure in FAR 9.5 when in the Government's interest.
              (b) Each request for waiver shall include:
              (1) The general rule or procedure proposed to be waived;

              (2) An analysis of the potential conflict, including the benefits and detriments to the Government and prospective contractors;
              
              (3) A discussion of why the conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated; and
              (4) Advice of counsel obtained under FAR 9.504(b).

                RFP
                Offeror
                1. To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest exists that may diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and objective review of the offeror's proposal, or may otherwise result in a biased opinion or an unfair advantage. If a potential conflict of interest arises or if I identify such a conflict, I agree to notify the Government promptly concerning the potential conflict. In determining whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I agree to review whether my or my employer's relationships with other persons or entities, including, but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds, other outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment arrangements (past, present, or under consideration), and, to the extent known by me, all financial interests and employment arrangements of my spouse, minor children, and other members of my immediate household, may place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the evaluation proceedings.

                2. I agree to use proposal information only for evaluation purposes. I understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed upon the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor or by the Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted information of the proposal. I agree to use my best effort to safeguard such information physically, and not to disclose the contents of, or release any information relating to, the proposal(s) to anyone outside of the Source Evaluation Board or other panel assembled for this acquisition, the Contracting Officer, or other individuals designated by the Contracting Officer.
                3. I agree to return to the Government all copies of proposals, as well as any abstracts, upon completion of the evaluation.

              (c) The release of a proposal to a non-Government evaluator for evaluation does not constitute the release of information for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
              (d) The contracting officer shall attach a cover page bearing the following notice: GOVERNMENT NOTICE FOR HANDLING PROPOSALS—This proposal shall be used and disclosed for evaluation purposes only. Attach a copy of this Government notice to every reproduction or abstract of the proposal. Any authorized restrictive notices which the submitter places on this proposal shall be strictly complied with. Disclosure of this proposal outside the Government for evaluation purposes shall be made only to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with, FAR 3.104-4, FAR 15.207, and AGAR 415.207.

              General policy.
              It is the policy of USDA to provide maximum practicable contracting and subcontracting opportunities to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), HUBZone small business, women-owned business (WOB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns.
            
            
              419.201-70
              Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).
              The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) develops rules, policy, procedures and guidelines for the effective administration of USDA's small business program that includes all categories named under 419.201.
            
            
              419.201-71
              Small business coordinators.
              The head of the contracting activity (HCA) or a representative of the HCA shall designate in writing a small business coordinator in each contracting office. Supervisors of small business coordinators are encouraged to provide sufficient time for the coordinators to carry out their small business program duties. Coordinators' duties shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
              (a) Reviewing each proposed acquisition expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold prior to its solicitation. The coordinator shall:
              (1) Recommend section 8(a), HUBZone, or SDVOSB action and identify potential contractors, or
              (2) Identify available SDB, WOB, and VOSB to be solicited by competitive procedures. Coordinators shall document the contract file with recommendations made and actions taken.
              (b) Participating in goal-setting procedures and planning activities and establishing aggressive SDB, WOB, and SDVOSB goals based on the annual review of advance acquisition plans.
              (c) Participating in the review of those contracts which require the successful offeror to submit written plans for the utilization of small businesses as subcontractors to include all preference program areas in 419.201.
              (d) Ensuring that purchases exceeding $2,500 and not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold are reserved exclusively for small businesses, including all preference program areas named in 419.201. This policy shall be implemented unless the contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two or more small business concerns that are competitive with market prices and in terms of quality and delivery of the goods or services being purchased.

              (e) Maintaining comprehensive source listings of small businesses.
              
              (f) Upon written request, providing small businesses (in the preference program areas named in 419.201) the bidders' mailing lists of individuals receiving solicitations which will contain the subcontracting clause entitled “Utilization of Small Business Concerns” (FAR 52.219-8). These lists may be limited to those supplies or services of major interest to the requesting firms.
              (g) Developing a program of contacts with local and small (to include all preference program areas named in 419.201) trade, business, and professional associations and organizations and Indian tribal councils to apprise them of USDA's program needs and recurring contract requirements.
              (h) Periodically meeting with program managers to discuss requirements of the small business preference program, to explore the feasibility of breaking large complex requirements into smaller lots suitable for participation by small firms, and to encourage program managers to meet with these firms so that their capabilities can be demonstrated.
              (i) Establishing internal operating procedures which implement the requirements of the regulations as set forth in this part 419.
              (j) Compiling data and preparing all reports pertaining to the small business program activities, and ensuring that these reports are accurate, complete and up-to-date.
              (k) Assisting and counseling small business firms.
              (l) Reviewing proposed large contract requirements that may be bundled to determine the potential for breaking out components suitable for purchase from small business firms.
              (m) Ensuring that the SBA Resident Procurement Center Representative (PCR) is provided an opportunity and reasonable time to review any solicitation that meets the dollar threshold for small business (including all preference program areas named in 419.201) subcontracting plans.

              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart implements and supplements FAR policies and procedures for acquiring products and services when preference is given to offers of products containing recovered materials. This subpart further supplements FAR subpart 23.4 by providing guidance for affirmative procurement programs in accordance with Executive Order 13101 and 42 U.S.C. 6962.
            
            
              423.402
              [Reserved]
            
            
              423.403
              Policy.
              It is the policy of USDA to acquire and use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated recycled content products.
            
            
              423.404
              Agency affirmative procurement programs.
              The USDA affirmative procurement program (APP) policy applicable to all USDA agencies and staff offices is hereby established. The components of this APP include:
              (a) Recovered Materials Preference Program. In accord with the requirements of Section 402(c) of Executive Order 13101, Greening the Government Through Recycling, Waste Prevention, and Federal Acquisition, USDA agencies will include, in all applicable solicitations and contracts, a preference for products and services which meet or exceed the EPA purchasing guidelines as contained in the EPA product Recovered Materials Advisory Notices (RMANs). Agencies may choose an evaluation factor preference, or other method of indicating preference in accord with their agency needs. Agencies will, as appropriate, eliminate virgin material requirements in contract specifications and replace them with a statement of preference for recycled materials.
              (b) Promotion program. USDA agencies will actively promote a preference for recovered materials, environmentally preferable products, and biobased products in contacts with vendors, in written materials, and other appropriate opportunities.
              (c) Reasonable estimation of recovered materials used in the performance of contracts. USDA agencies annually will provide in writing to the USDA Senior Procurement Executive, in response to a call for data for the Resource Conservation and Recovery report, reasonable estimates, certification, and verification of recovered material used in the performance of contracts.
              (d) Annual review and monitoring of effectiveness of the program. USDA agencies will provide an annual assessment of the effectiveness of their affirmative procurement program actions in increasing the purchase and use of EPA designated products.
              (e) Purchase of EPA designated products. USDA agencies will require that 100% of purchases of EPA-designated products contain recovered material, unless the item cannot be acquired—
              (1) Competitively within a reasonable time frame;
              (2) Meeting appropriate performance standards; or
              (3) At a reasonable price.
              (f) The 100% purchase requirement of paragraph (e) of this section applies to all USDA agency purchases, including those at or below the micro-purchase threshold.
            
            
              423.405
              Procedures.
              (a) The threshold of purchase for EPA designated items is $10,000 per year at the USDA departmental, not individual agency, level. Therefore, the APP requirements above, including the 100% purchase requirement, apply at the individual agency and staff office level.

              (b) Contracting officers should refer to EPA's list of designated products and products identified as recycled content when purchasing supplies or services. Information on EPA designated products is available at: www.epa.gov/cpg/products.htm.
              
              (c) All agencies and USDA Contracting Officers must take necessary actions to carry out the provisions of the USDA APP policy described in this subpart.

              Suspension of payments, termination of contract, and debarment and suspension actions.
              (a) The contracting officer may recommend waiver of the determination to suspend payments, to terminate a contract, or to debar or to suspend a contractor.
              (b) The recommendation shall be submitted through the HCA to the SPE and shall include a full description of the disruption of USDA operations should the determination not be waived.
              (c) The SPE will submit the request for a waiver to the Secretary with a recommendation for action.

              423.703
              Policy.
              (a) USDA's Affirmative Procurement Program promotes energy-efficiency, water conservation, and the acquisition of environmentally preferable products and services. In its acquisitions, USDA will support federal “green purchasing” principles in the acquisition of products and services that are environmentally preferable or that are biobased content products and services.
              (b) USDA agencies will actively promote this preference for environmentally preferable products and biobased products in contacts with vendors, in written materials, and other appropriate opportunities.

              Progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion are authorized for use as a payment method under USDA contracts or subcontracts for construction, alteration or repair, and shipbuilding and conversion. Such payments also are authorized for service contracts, if the contracting officer determines that progress payments based on costs are not practicable and adequate safeguards are provided to administer progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion. For all other contracts, progress payment provisions shall be based on costs except that the HCA may authorize progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion on a case-by-case basis. Each authorization by the HCA shall include a determination and finding that progress payments based on costs cannot be employed practically and that there are adequate safeguards provided for the administration of progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion.

              (a) When approving a progress payment under a construction contract, the contracting officer shall indicate the amount to be paid by the payment office and include in the contract file the rationale in support of the payment.
              (b) When a retainage is made on a progress payment under a construction contract, the contracting officer shall place in the contract file a written determination stating the reason(s) for the retainage.
              (c) When a progress payment under a construction contract has been approved, the amount to be paid, the amount of any retainage withheld, and the reason(s) for the retainage shall be provided to the contractor by the contracting officer in writing before the payment due date.
              (d) When the contractor, under a fixed-price construction contract, furnishes evidence to the contracting officer that the surety has been paid in full for bond premiums and requests reimbursement, the first subsequent progress payment shall include the total amount attributable to such bond premiums and the Government shall pay that amount in full. This amount paid for the bond premiums is not an amount in addition to the stated contract price.

              Evaluation of contractor performance.
              
                Preparation of performance evaluation reports. In addition to the requirements of FAR 36.201, performance evaluation reports shall be prepared for indefinite-delivery type contracts when either the contract maximum or the contracting activity's reasonable estimate of services to be ordered exceeds $500,000.00. For these contracts, performance evaluation reports shall be prepared for each order at the time of final acceptance of the work under the order.

              Government estimate of construction costs.
              For acquisitions using sealed bid procedures, the contracting officer may disclose the overall amount of the Government's estimate of construction costs following identification of the responsive bid most advantageous to the Government; verification of that bid's price reasonableness; and verification of the bidder's responsibility. For acquisitions using other than sealed bid procedures (e.g., negotiation), the contracting officer may disclose the overall amount of the estimate after contract award.
            
            
              436.204
              Disclosure of the magnitude of construction projects.
              In the case of indefinite-delivery type contracts, the reasonable estimate of work to be done or the maximum in the solicitation, both including all options, is to be used to select the price range. Contracting officers may elect to use both a price range for the base period of services and the total, inclusive of options, to best describe the magnitude of the solicitation.

              (a) When it appears that funds available for a project may be insufficient for all the desired features of construction, the contracting officer may provide in the solicitation for a base bid item covering the work generally as specified and for one or more additive or deductive bid items which progressively add or omit specified features of the work in a stated order of priority. In this case, the contracting officer shall insert the provision at 452.236-70, Additive or Deductive Items, in solicitations for construction.
              (b) In the alternative to the process in paragraph (a) of this section, the contracting officer may use the policies and procedures found in FAR 17.2.

              (a) The Office of Inspector General (OIG), Audit Division, has established a cross-servicing arrangement with the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) to provide contract audit services required by the FAR.
              (b) All contract audit services required by contracting officers, except those which can be accomplished in-house, shall be coordinated through the cognizant OIG Regional Inspector General—Auditing (RIG-A). Cognizance is determined on the basis of the contractor's location. There is no charge for DCAA audit services coordinated through OIG.
              (c) In order to ensure compliance with this requirement and to evaluate the results of audits, contracting officers shall forward to the RIG-A copies of all price negotiation memoranda prepared for contracts and contract modifications in excess of $500,000.

              The Contractor Performance System (CPS), developed by the National Institutes of Health, is designated as the single USDA-wide system for maintaining contractor performance/evaluation information. Use of the CPS is mandatory. As a minimum, the CPS shall be accessed for contractor past performance information as part of proposal evaluation in accordance with FAR subpart 15.3, and information resulting from the evaluation of contractor performance in accordance with FAR subpart 42.15 shall be entered into and maintained in this system. The CPS is a part of the USDA Acquisition Toolkit which can be accessed from the USDA Procurement Homepage at http://www.usda.gov/procurement/.

                (As used in this provision, the term “brand name” includes identification of products by make and model.)
                (a) If items called for by this solicitation have been identified by a “brand name or equal” description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Offers of “equal” products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the offer (see clause 452.211-71) and are determined by the Contracting Officer to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the solicitation.
                (b) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that it is offering an “equal” product, the offeror shall be considered as offering the brand name product(s) referenced in the solicitation.

                (c)(1) If the offeror proposes to furnish an “equal” product or products, the brand name(s), if any, and any other required information about the product(s) to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the solicitation. The evaluation of offers and the determination as to the equality of the product(s) offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the offeror or identified in its offer as well as other information reasonably available to the contracting activity. Caution to offerors: The contracting activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer and is not reasonably available to the contracting activity. Accordingly, to assure that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a part of its offer all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting activity to (i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the solicitation, and (ii) establish exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific reference to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting activity.
                (2) If an offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the solicitation, the offer shall include (i) a clear description of such proposed modifications and (ii) clearly marked descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

                Instructions for the Preparation of Technical and Business Proposals (SEP 1999)
                (a) General Instructions. Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall be furnished in the following format with the numbers of copies as specified below.
                (1) The proposal must include a technical proposal and business proposal. Each of the parts shall be separate and complete so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently from evaluation of the other. The technical proposal must not contain reference to cost; however, resource information (such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc.) must be contained in the technical proposal so that the contractor's understanding of the statement of work may be evaluated.
                (2) Offerors may, at their discretion, submit alternate proposals or proposals which deviate from the requirement; provided, that an offeror also submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the statement of work. Any “alternate” proposal may be considered if overall performance would be improved or not compromised, and if it is in the best interest of the Government. Alternate proposals, or deviations from any requirement of this RFP, must be clearly identified.
                (3) The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in Section M of this RFP.
                (4) Offerors shall submit their proposal(s) in the following format and the quantities specified:
                (a) ___* copies of the completed, signed offer (Sections A through K of the solicitation package)
                (b) ___* copies of the technical proposal
                (c) ___* copies of the business/cost proposal
                (b) Technical Proposal Instructions. The technical proposal will be used to make an evaluation and arrive at a determination as to whether the proposal will meet the requirements of the Government. Therefore, the technical proposal must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the requirements and a detailed, description of the techniques, procedures and program for achieving the objectives of the specifications/statement of work. Proposals which merely paraphrase the requirements of the Government's specifications/ statement of work, or use such phrases as “will comply” or “standard techniques will be employed” will be considered unacceptable and will not be considered further. As a minimum, the proposal must clearly provide the following:
                (Contracting Officer shall identify in this section the minimum information required to evaluate each technical evaluation factor listed in Section M.)
                (c) Business Proposal Instructions.
                
                (1) Cost Proposal.
                In addition to any other requirements for cost/pricing information required in clause FAR 52.215-20, Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 1997), the following is required:
                (Contracting Officer shall identify additional information required if appropriate.)
                (2) Business Proposal.

                (a) Furnish financial statements for the last two years, including an interim statement for the current year, unless previously provided to the office issuing the RFP, in which case a statement as to when and where this information was provided may be furnished instead.
                
                (b) Specify the financial capacity, working capital and other resources available to perform the contract without assistance from any outside source.
                (c) Provide the name, location, and intercompany pricing policy for other divisions, subsidiaries, parent company, or affiliated companies that will perform work or furnish materials under this contract.

                (b) In addition to the types of confidential information described in (a)(1) and (2) above, information which might require special consideration with regard to the timing of its disclosure may derive from studies or research, during which public disclosure of primarily invalidated findings could create an erroneous conclusion which might threaten public health or safety if acted upon.
                (c) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, by mutual consent, identify elsewhere in this contract specific information and/or categories of information which the Government will furnish to the Contractor or that the Contractor is expected to generate which is confidential.

                (e) Confidential information, as defined in (a)(1) and (2) above, shall not be disclosed without the prior written consent of the individual, institution or organization.

                (f) Written advance notice of at least 45 days will be provided to the Contracting Officer of the Contractor's intent to release findings of studies or research, which have the possibility of adverse effects on the public or the Federal agency, as described in (b) above. If the Contracting Officer does not pose any objections in writing within the 45 day period, the Contractor may proceed with disclosure.

                (a) Workers Compensation and Employer's Liability. The Contractor is required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a Contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage. Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 shall be required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit worker's compensation to be written by private carriers.
                (b) General Liability. The Contractor shall have bodily injury liability insurance coverage written on a comprehensive form of policy of at least $500,000 per occurrence.
                (c) Automobile Liability. The Contractor shall have automobile liability insurance written on a comprehensive form of policy.

                (d) Aircraft Public and Passenger Liability.

Coverage shall be at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury, other than passenger injury. Coverage for passenger injury shall be at least $200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or passengers, whichever is greater.

                The Contract Price includes the total amount for premiums that the Contractor attributes to the furnishing of performance and payment bonds required by the contract. Reimbursement for bond premiums under the clause at FAR 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction, shall not cover any amount therefor not included in the contract price.

              Additive or Deductive Items.
              As prescribed in 436.205, insert the following provision:
              
                Additive or Deductive Items (FEB 1988)
                The low bidder for purposes of award shall be the conforming responsible bidder offering the low aggregate amount for the first or base bid item, plus or minus (in the order of priority listed in the schedule) those additive or deductive bid items providing the most features of the work within the funds determined by the government to be available before bids are opened. If addition of another bid item in the listed order of priority would make the award exceed such funds for all bidders, it shall be skipped and the next subsequent additive bid item in a lower amount shall be added if award therein can be made within such funds. For example, when the amount available is $100,000 and a bidder's base bid and four successive additives are $85,000, $10,000, $8,000, $6,000, and $4,000, the aggregate amount of the bid for purposes of award would be $99,000 for the base bid plus the first and fourth additives, the second and third additives being skipped because of each of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000. In any case all bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same additive or deductive bid items, determined as above provided. The listed order of priority need be followed only for determining the low bidder. After determination of the low bidder as stated, award in the best interests of the Government may be made on the selected first or base bid item and any combination of additive or deductive items for which funds are determined to be available at the time of the award, provided that award on such combination of bid items does not exceed the amount offered by any other conforming responsible bidder for the same combination of bid items.

              As prescribed in section 436.578, the following clause shall be inserted in Intergrated Resource Service Contracts (IRSC) awarded for the Forest Service.
              
                Fire Suppression and Liability Clause
                (a) Contractor's Responsibility for Fire Fighting. The Contractor, under the provisions of FAR clause at 52.236-9, Protection of Existing Vegetation, Structures, Equipment, Utilities, and Improvements, shall immediately extinguish all fires on the work site other than those fires in use as a part of the work. The Contractor may be held liable for all damages and for all costs incurred by the Government for labor, subsistence, equipment, supplies, and transportation deemed necessary to control or suppress a fire set or caused by the Contractor or the Contractor's agents or employees subject to the following fire classifications listed in subsection (b).
                (b) Fire Suppression Costs. The Contractor's obligations for cost of fire suppression vary according to three classifications of fires as follows:
                (1) Operations Fire. An “operations fire” is a fire caused by the Contractor's operations other than a negligent fire. The Contractor agrees to reimburse Forest Service for such cost for each operations fire, subject to a maximum dollar amount of [Contracting Officer insert amount]. The cost of the Contractor's actions, supplies, and equipment on any such fire, or otherwise provided at the request of Forest Service, shall be credited toward such maximum. If the Contractor's actual cost exceeds contractor's obligation stated above, Forest Service shall reimburse the contractor for the excess.
                (2) Negligent Fire. A “negligent fire” is a fire caused by the negligence or fault of the Contractor's operations including, but not limited to, one caused by smoking by persons engaged in the Contractor's operations during the course of their employment, or during rest or lunch periods; or if the Contractor's failure to comply with requirements under this contract results in a fire starting, or permits a fire to spread. Damages and the cost of suppressing negligent fires shall be borne by the Contractor.
                (3) Other Fires on Contract Area. Forest Service shall pay the Contractor, at firefighting rates common in the area or at prior agreed rates, for equipment or personnel furnished by the Contractor at the request of Forest Service, on any fire on contract area other than an operations fire or a negligent fire.
                (c) Contractor's Responsibility for Notification in Case of Fire. The Contractor shall immediately notify the Government of any fires sighted on or in the vicinity of the work site.
                (d) Contractor's Responsibility for Responding to Emergencies. When directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall temporarily redirect employees and equipment from the work site for emergency work (anticipated to be restricted to firefighting). This is considered to be within the general scope of the contract. An equitable adjustment for any such redirection of employees and equipment will be made under the FAR clause at 52.243-4, Changes.
                (e) Performance by the Contractor. Where the Contractor's employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or their employees or agents perform the Contractor's operations in connection with fire responsibilities, the Contractor's obligations shall be the same as if performance was by Contractor.
                (f) State Law. The Contractor shall not be relieved by the terms of this contract of any liability to the United States for fire suppression costs recovered in an action based on State law, except for such costs resulting from operations fires. Amounts due to the Contractor for firefighting expenditures on operations fires shall not be withheld pending settlement of any such claim or action based on State law.

              Lowest landed cost means, as authorized by 46 U.S.C. 55314(c), with respect to an agricultural product acquired under this part the lowest aggregate cost for the acquisition of such product and the shipment of such product to a foreign destination.
            
              Multi-port voyage charter means the charter of an ocean carrier in which the carrier will stop at two or more ports to discharge cargo.
          
          
            470.102
            Policy.
            (a) Policy. It is the policy of the Department to follow the policies and procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as supplemented by the Agriculture Acquisition Regulation, including this part, in the procurement of agricultural commodities and products of agricultural commodities that are used in domestic feeding and international feeding and development programs.
            (b) Electronic submission. To the maximum extent possible, the use of electronic submission of solicitation-related documents shall be used with respect to the acquisition of agricultural commodities and related freight; however, to the extent that a solicitation allows for the submission of written information in addition to information in an electronic format and there is a discrepancy in such submissions, the information submitted in a written format shall prevail unless the electronic submission states that a specific existing written term is superseded by the electronic submission.
            (c) Freight. With respect to the acquisition of freight for the shipment of agricultural commodities and products of agricultural commodities, the provisions of the FAR, including part 47, shall be utilized and various types of services to be obtained may include multi-trip voyage charters.
          
          
            470.103
            United States origin of agricultural products.
            (a) Products of United States origin. As provided by 7 U.S.C. 1732(2) and 1736o-1(a) commodities and the products of agricultural commodities acquired for use in international feeding and development programs shall be products of United States origin. A product shall not be considered to be a product of the United States if it contains any ingredient that is not produced in the United States if that ingredient is:
            (1) Produced in the United States; and
            (2) Commercially available in the United States at fair and reasonable prices from domestic sources.
            (b) Use by the Food and Nutrition Service. Commodities and the products of agricultural commodities acquired for use by the Food and Nutrition Service shall be a product of the United States, except as may otherwise be required by law, and shall be considered to be such a product if it is grown, processed, and otherwise prepared for sale or distribution exclusively in the United States except with respect to ingredients. Ingredients from non-domestic sources will be allowed to be utilized as a United States product if such ingredients are not otherwise:
            (1) Produced in the United States; and
            (2) Commercially available in the United States at fair and reasonable prices from domestic sources.
            (c) Commingled product. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a commingled product shall be considered to be a product of the United States if the offeror can establish that the offeror has in inventory at the time the contract for the commodity or product is awarded to the offeror, or obtains during the contract performance period specified in the solicitation, or a combination thereof, a sufficient quantity of the commodity or product that was produced in the United States to fulfill the contract being awarded, and all unfulfilled contracts that the offeror entered into to provide such commingled product to the United States.
            (2) To the extent the Department has determined a commodity is one that is generally commingled, but is also one which can be readily stored on an identity preserved basis with respect to its country of origin, the Department may require that the commodity procured by the Department shall be of 100 percent United States origin.
            (d) Product derived from animals. With respect to the procurement of products derived from animals, the solicitation will set forth any specific requirement that is applicable to the country in which the animal was bred, raised, slaughtered or further processed.
          
          
            
            470.200
            [Reserved]
          
          
            470.201
            Acquisition of commodities and freight shipment for Foreign Agricultural Service programs.
            (a) Lowest landed cost and delivery considerations. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, in contracts for the Foreign Agricultural Service for commodities and related freight shipment for delivery to foreign destinations, the contracting officer shall consider the lowest landed cost of delivering the commodity to the intended destination. This lowest landed cost determination will be calculated on the basis of rates and service for that portion of the commodities being purchased that is determined is necessary and practicable to meet 46 U.S.C. 55314(c)(3) and cargo preference requirements and on an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the remaining portion of the commodities being procured and the additional factors set forth in this section. Accordingly, the solicitations issued with respect to a commodity procurement or a related freight procurement will specify that in the event an offer submitted by a party is the lowest offered price, the contracting officer reserves the right to reject such offer if the acceptance of another offer for the commodity or related freight, when combined with other offers for commodities or related freight, results in a lower landed cost to the Department.
            (2) The Department may contact any port prior to award to determine the port's cargo handling capabilities, including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect the cargo. Factors considered in this determination may include, but not be limited to, the adequacy of building structures, proper ventilation, freedom from insects and rodents, cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and warehousing practices. The Department may consider the use of another coastal range or port if a situation exists at a port that may adversely affect the ability of the Department to have the commodity delivered in a safe and timely manner. Such situations include:
            (i) A port is congested;
            (ii) Port facilities are overloaded;
            (iii) A vessel would not be able to dock and load cargo without delay;
            (iv) Labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; or
            (v) Other similar situation that may adversely affect the ability of the Department to have the commodity delivered in a timely manner.
            (3) Use of other than lowest landed cost. In order to ensure that commodities are delivered in a timely fashion to foreign destinations and without damage, the contracting officer may award an acquisition without regard to the lowest land cost process set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if:
            (i) The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or
            (ii) After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:
            (A) Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign destination;
            (B) A specific port's cargo handling capabilities (including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect commodities) and other similar factors may adversely affect the delivery of such commodities through damage or untimely delivery. Such similar factors include, but are not limited to: port congestion; overloaded facilities at the port; vessels not being able to dock and load cargo without delay due to conditions at the port; labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; and the existence of inadequate or unsanitary warehouse and other supporting facilities;
            (C) The total transit time of a carrier, as it relates to a final delivery date at the foreign destination may impair the timely delivery of the commodity;
            (D) Other similar situations arise that materially affect the administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is being procured; or

            (E) The contracting officer determines that extenuating circumstances preclude awards on the basis of lowest-landed cost, or that efficiency and cost-savings justify use of types of ocean service that would not involve an analysis of freight. However, in all such cases, commodities would be transported in compliance with cargo preference requirements. Examples of extenuating circumstances are events such as internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatening the lives of persons at the foreign destination. Other types of services may include, but are not limited to, multi-trip voyage charters, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), delivery cost and freight (C & F), delivery cost insurance and freight (CIF), and indexed ocean freight costs.
            (4) If a contracting officer determines that action may be appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer will provide to the Head of Contracting Activity Designee a written request to obtain commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost basis consistent with Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations. This request shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed cost basis. The Head of the Contracting Activity Designee, or the designee one level above the contracting officer, may either accept or reject this request and shall document this determination.
            (b) Multiple offers or delivery points. If more than one offer for the sale of commodities is received or more than one delivery point has been designated in such offers, in order to achieve a combination of a freight rate and commodity award that produces the lowest landed cost for the delivery of the commodity to the foreign destination, the contracting officer shall evaluate offers submitted on a delivery point by delivery point basis; however, consideration shall be given to prioritized ocean transport service in determining lowest landed cost.
            (c) Freight shipping and rates. (1) In determining the lowest-landed cost, the Department shall use the freight rates offered in response to solicitations issued by the Department or, if applicable, the grantee organization.
            (2) Freight rates offered must be submitted as specified in the solicitation issued by the Department or, if applicable, the grantee organization. Any such solicitation issued by a grantee organization must contain the following elements:
            (i) If directed by the Department, include a closing time for the receipt of written freight offers and state that late written freight offers will not be considered;
            (ii) Provide that freight offers are required to have a canceling date no later than the last contract lay day specified in the solicitation;
            (iii) Provide the same deadline for receipt of written freight offers from both U.S. flag vessel and non-U.S. flag vessels; and
            (iv) Be received and opened prior to any related offer for acquisition of commodities to be shipped.
            (3) The Department may require organizations that will receive commodities from the Department to submit information relating to the capacity of a U.S. port, or, if applicable, a terminal, prior to the acquisition of such commodities or freight.
            (d) Freight rate notification. If the Department is not the party procuring freight with respect to a shipment of an agricultural commodity for delivery to a foreign destination, the organization that will receive commodities from the Department, or its shipping agent, shall be notified by the Department of the vessel freight rate used in determining the commodity contract award and the organization will be responsible for finalizing the charter or booking contract with the vessel representing the freight rate.
          
          
            470.202
            Acquisition of commodities for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) programs.
            (a) Lowest landed cost and delivery considerations. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (e)(2) of this section, with respect to the acquisition of agricultural commodities for delivery to foreign destinations and related freight to transport such commodities under Title II of Public Law 480, contracts will be entered into in a manner that will result in the lowest landed cost of such commodity delivery to the intended destination. This lowest landed cost determination shall be calculated on the basis of rates and service for that portion of the commodities being purchased that is determined is necessary and practicable to meet 46 U.S.C. 55314(c)(3) and cargo preference requirements and on an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the remaining portion of the commodities being procured and the additional factors set forth in this section. Accordingly, the solicitations issued with respect to a commodity procurement or a freight procurement will specify that in the event an offer submitted by a party is the lowest offered price, the contracting officer reserves the right to reject such offer if the acceptance of another offer for the commodity or freight, when combined with other offers for commodities or freight, results in a lower landed cost to USAID.
            (2) The Department may contact any port prior to award to determine the port's cargo handling capabilities, including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect the cargo. Factors which will be considered in this determination will include, but not be limited to, the adequacy of building structures, proper ventilation, freedom from insects and rodents, cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and warehousing practices. The Department may consider the use of another coastal range or port if a situation exists at a port that may adversely affect the ability of the Department to have the commodity delivered in a safe and/or timely manner. Such situations include:
            (i) A port is congested;
            (ii) Port facilities are overloaded;
            (iii) A vessel would not be able to dock and load cargo without delay;
            (iv) Labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; or
            (v) Other similar situation that may adversely affect the ability of the Department to have the commodity delivered in a timely manner.
            (3) Use of other than lowest landed cost. In order to ensure that commodities are delivered in a timely fashion to foreign destinations and without damage, the Department may complete an acquisition without regard to the lowest land cost process set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if:
            (i) The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or
            (ii) After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:
            (A) Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign destination;
            (B) A specific port's cargo handling capabilities (including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect commodities) and other similar factors will adversely affect the delivery of such commodities without damage or in a timely manner. Such similar factors include, but are not limited to: port congestion; overloaded facilities at the port; vessels would not be able to dock and load cargo without delay; labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; and the existence of inadequate or unsanitary warehouse and other supporting facilities;
            (C) The total transit time of a carrier, as it relates to a final delivery date at the foreign destination may impair the ability of the Department to achieve timely delivery of the commodity; or
            (D) Other similar situations arise that materially affect the administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is being procured.

            (4) If the contracting officer determines that action may be appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer shall provide to the head of contracting activity designee and to USAID, a written request to obtain commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost basis. This request shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed cost basis. The head of contracting authority designee, or one level above the contracting officer, with the concurrence of USAID, shall, on an expedited basis, either accept or reject this request and shall document this determination in writing and provide a copy to USAID.
            
            (b) Freight shipping and rates. (1) In determining lowest-landed cost as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department shall use vessel rates offered in response to solicitations issued by USAID or grantee organizations receiving commodities under 7 U.S.C. 1731 et seq.
            
            (2) USAID may require, or direct a grantee organization to require, an ocean carrier to submit offers electronically through a Web-based system maintained by the Department. If electronic submissions are required, the Department may, at its discretion, accept corrections to such submissions that are submitted in a written form other than by use of such Web-based system.
            (c) Delivery date. The contracting officer shall consider total transit time, as it relates to a final delivery date, in order to satisfy Public Law 480 Title II program requirements.
            (d) Delivery points. (1) Commodities offered for delivery free alongside ship Great Lakes port range or intermodal bridge-point Great Lakes port range that represent the overall (foreign and U.S. flag) lowest landed cost will be awarded on a lowest landed cost basis. Tonnage allocated on this basis will not be reevaluated on a lowest landed cost U.S.-flag basis unless the contracting officer determines that 25 percent of the total annual tonnage of bagged, processed, or fortified commodities furnished under 7 U.S.C. 1731 et seq. has been, or will be, transported from the Great Lakes port range during that fiscal year.
            (2) The contracting officer shall consider commodity offers as offers for delivery “intermodal bridge-point Great Lakes port range” only if:
            (i) The offer specifies delivery at a marine cargo-handling facility that is capable of loading ocean going vessels at a Great Lakes port, as well as loading ocean going conveyances such as barges and container vans, and
            (ii) The commodities will be moved from one transportation conveyance to another at such a facility.
            (e) Multiple awards or delivery points. (1) If more than one offer for the sale of commodities is received or more than one delivery point has been designated in such offers, in order to achieve a combination of a freight rate and commodity award that produces the lowest landed cost for the delivery of the commodity to the foreign destination, the contracting officer shall evaluate offers submitted on a delivery point by delivery point basis; however, consideration shall be given to prioritized ocean transport service in determining lowest landed cost.
            (2) The contracting officer may determine that extenuating circumstances preclude awards on the basis of lowest landed cost. However, in all such cases, commodities may be transported in compliance with cargo preference requirements as determined by USAID.
            (3) The contracting officer shall notify USAID or, if applicable, the grantee organization, that its shipping agent will be notified of the vessel freight rate used in determining the commodity contract award. The grantee organization or USAID will be responsible for finalizing the charter or booking contract with the vessel representing the freight rate so used.
          
          
            470.203
            Cargo preference.
            An agency having responsibility under this subpart shall administer its programs, with respect to this subpart, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation.

              Purpose.
              (a) The General Services Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) contains agency acquisition policies and practices, contract clauses, solicitation provisions, and forms that control the relationship between GSA and contractors and prospective contractors.
              (b) GSAR address rules directly to you, the contracting officer, unless otherwise indicated.
            
            
              501.103
              Authority.
              GSA's Senior Procurement Executive issues the GSAR under the authority of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended.
            
            
              501.104
              Applicability.
              (a) General. The GSAR applies to contracts for suppliers or services, including construction.
              (b) Acquisition of leasehold interests in real property. Part 570 establishes rules for the acquisition of leasehold interests in real property. Other provisions of 48 CFR chapter 5 (GSAR) do not apply to leases of real property unless specifically cross-reference in part 570.
              (c) Relationship to state. Some GSAR rules implement and interpret laws and other authorities affecting procurement. A GSAR rule specifically directed by statute has the force and effect of law.

              The GSAR is published in the following sources:
              (a) The Federal Register at https://www.federalregister.gov/.

              501.105-2
              Arrangement of regulations.
              (a) The GSAR numbers and captions policies and procedures to correspond to how they appear in the FAR, e.g., 1.104 in the FAR is 501.104 in the GSAR.
              (b) GSAR rules not implementing the FAR have numbers beginning with 70, e.g., part 570, subsection 515.209-70.
              (c) The GSAR may have gaps in its numbering scheme because a FAR rule may not require GSAR implementation.

                Commercial supplier agreements means terms and conditions customarily offered to the public by vendors of supplies or services that meet the definition of “commercial item” set forth in FAR 2.101 and intended to create a binding legal obligation on the end user. Commercial supplier agreements are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, including acquisitions of commercial computer software and commercial technical data, but they may apply to any supply or service. The term applies—
              (a) Regardless of the format or style of the document. For example, a commercial supplier agreement may be styled as standard terms of sale or lease, Terms of Service (TOS), End User License Agreement (EULA), or another similar legal instrument or agreement, and may be presented as part of a proposal or quotation responding to a solicitation for a contract or order;
              (b) Regardless of the media or delivery mechanism used. For example, a commercial supplier agreement may be presented as one or more paper documents or may appear on a computer or other electronic device screen during a purchase, software installation, other product delivery, registration for a service, or another transaction.

              Treatment of violations.
              (a) The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, makes determinations under FAR 3.204.
              The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, takes all the following actions:
              (1) Coordinates with legal counsel;
              (2) Initiates proceedings under FAR 3.204(a) by notifying the contractor that GSA is considering action against the contractor for a violation of the Gratuities clause. Notice is sent by a certified letter to the last known address of the party, its counsel, or agent for service of process. In the case of a business, notice is sent to any partner, principal officer, director, owner or co-owner; and
              (3) Presumes receipt if no return receipt is received within 10 calendar days after mailing the notice.
              (b) The contractor has 30 calendar days to exercise its rights under FAR 3.204(b), unless the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, grants an extension.
              (c) If there is a dispute of fact material to making a determination, the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, may refer the matter to an agency fact-finding official, designated by the Suspension and Debarment Official, in accordance with GSAR 509.403. Referrals for fact-finding are not made in cases arising from a conviction or indictment as defined in FAR 9.403. If a referral is made, the fact-finding official takes all the following actions:
              (1) Gives the contractor an opportunity to dispute material facts relating to the determinations under FAR 3.204(a)(1) and (2);
              (2) Conducts proceedings under rules consistent with FAR 3.204(b);
              (3) Schedules a hearing within 20 calendar days of receipt of the referral. The contractor or GSA may request an extension for good cause; and
              (4) Delivers to the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, written findings of fact (together with a transcription of the proceedings, if made) within 20 calendar days after the hearing record closes. The findings must resolve any material disputes of fact by a preponderance of the evidence.
              (d) The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, may reject the findings of the fact-finding official only if the findings are clearly erroneous or arbitrary and capricious.
              (e) In cases arising from conviction or indictment, or in which there are no disputes of material fact, the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, conducts the hearing required by FAR 3.204(b).
              (f) If the Gratuities clause was violated, the contractor may present evidence of mitigating factors to the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, in accordance with FAR 3.204(b) either orally or in writing, consistent with a schedule the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, establishes. The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, exercises the Government's rights under FAR 3.204(c) only after considering mitigating factors.

The intent of this policy is to prevent the appearance of Government bias toward any product or service.

              (b) The information required to be inserted in the clause at FAR 52.203-14, Display of Hotline Poster(s), is as follows:

              (a) The FPDS database. The General Services Administration awarded a contract for creation and operation of the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) database. That database includes information reported by departments and agencies as required by FAR subpart 4.6. One of the primary purposes of the FPDS database is to provide information on Government procurement to the public.
              (b) Fee for direct hook-up. To the extent that a member of the public requests establishment of real-time integration of reporting services to run reports from another application, a one-time charge of $2,500 for the original integration must be paid by the requestor. This one-time charge covers the setup and certification required for an integrator to access the FPDS database and for technical assistance to help integrators use the web services. The fee will be paid to the FPDS contractor and credited to invoices submitted to GSA by the FPDS contractor.

              Procedures.
              In addition to the requirements found in FAR 4.1103, prior to awarding a contractual instrument the contracting officer must—

              (a) Verify that the prospective contractor's legal business name, Doing-Business-As (DBA) name (if any), physical street address, and Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number or DUNS+4 number, as found in the System for Award Management (SAM), match the information that will be included in the contract, order, or agreement resulting from the vendor's quote or proposal. Correct any mismatches by having the vendor amend the information in the SAM and/or the quote or proposal. The SAM information can be accessed through the SAM Web site (www.sam.gov) by creating a user account.
              (b) Ensure that the contractor's address code exists in Pegasys and that it is SAM enabled with the contractor's DUNS or DUNS+4 number. This can be done by searching Pegasys records using the contractor's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). If no code exists, request that a new address code be established by the Finance Center for SAM compliance.
              (c) Ensure that the contractor's identifying information is correctly placed on the contractual instrument, using special care to ensure that the legal name and “remit to” name match exactly. (Note: Lockbox names or numbers should not be used to replace the contractor's name in the remittance block on the contractual instrument.)
              (d) Unless one of the exceptions to registration in SAM applies (see FAR 4.1102(a)), the contracting officer must not award a contract to a prospective contractor who is not registered in SAM. If no exceptions are applicable, and the needs of the requiring activity allows for a delay in award, see FAR 4.1103(b)(1).

              Obtaining information.
              FAR 9.105-1 lists a number of sources of information that a contracting officer may utilize before making a determination of responsibility. The contracting officer may request information directly from a prospective contractor using GSA Form 527, Contractor's Qualifications and Financial Information, but only after exhausting other available sources of information.

              (a) The contracting officer shall provide written notification to a prospective contractor determined not responsible. Include the basis for the determination. Notification provides the prospective contractor with the opportunity to correct any problem for future solicitations.
              (b) Due to the potential for de facto debarment, the contracting officer shall avoid making repeated determinations of nonresponsibility based on the same past performance information.
              (c) To provide for timely consideration of the need to institute action to debar a contractor, the contracting officer shall submit a copy of each nonresponsibility determination, other than those based on capacity or financial capability, to the Suspension and Debarment Official in the Office of Acquisition Policy.

              Continuation of current contracts.
              (a) When a contractor appears as a current exclusion in the System for Award Management (SAM), consider terminating a contract under any of the following circumstances:
              (1) Any circumstances giving rise to the debarment or suspension also constitute a default in the contractor's performance of the contract.
              (2) The contractor presents a significant risk to the Government in completing the contract.
              (3) The conduct that provides the cause of the suspension, proposed debarment, or debarment involved a GSA contract.
              (b) Before terminating a contract when a contractor appears as a current exclusion in the SAM, consider the following factors:
              (1) Seriousness of the cause for debarment or suspension.
              (2) Extent of contract performance.
              (3) Potential costs of termination and reprocurement.
              (4) Need for or urgency of the requirement, contract coverage, and the impact of delay for reprocurement.
              (5) Availability of other safeguards to protect the Government's interest until completion of the contract.
              (6) Availability of alternate competitive sources to meet the requirement (e.g., other multiple award contracts, readily available commercial items.)
              (c) The responsibilities of the agency head under FAR 9.405-1 are delegated to the Senior Procurement Executive.

              509.406-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. (1) Refer to the Suspension and Debarment Official matters involving serious contract improprieties or performance deficiencies. Performance deficiencies that continue over a period of time or apply to more than one contract may warrant debarment consideration.
              (2) Refer possible criminal or fraudulent activities to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). See 5 CFR 6701.107, Reporting Waste, Fraud, Abuse, and Corruption. If, after investigation, the OIG believes a cause for debarment exists, it will refer the matter to the Suspension and Debarment Official for consideration of debarment action.
              (b) Reports. Include in referrals to the Suspension and Debarment Official a report that contains at least the following:
              (1) The recommendation and supporting rationale.
              (2) A list of parties to be considered for possible debarment, including the contractor, principals, and affiliates. Include last known home and business addresses, zip codes, and DUNS Numbers.
              (3) A statement of facts.
              (4) Copies of documentary evidence and a list of witnesses. Include addresses and telephone numbers. Determine their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and identify the subject matter of their testimony.
              (5) GSA's acquisition history with the contractor. Include recent experience, copies of the pertinent contracts, and an explanation of impact debarment would have on GSA programs. OIG referrals do not require this explanation; the Suspension and Debarment Official will obtain the information directly from the contracting activity(s).
              (6) A list of any known active or potential criminal investigations, criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims before the Board of Contract Appeals.
              (c) Review. The Suspension and Debarment Official will review the report, and after coordinating with assigned legal counsel—
              (1) Initiate debarment action;
              (2) Decline debarment action;
              (3) Request additional information; or
              (4) Refer the matter to the OIG for further investigation and development of a case file.
              (d) Decisionmaking process. (1) The Suspension and Debarment Official will provide:
              (i) Notice of declinations, proposed debarments, and decisions to the referring activity.
              (ii) Notice of proposed debarment to each party being considered for debarment.
              (iii) Decision notices to each party after considering information in the administrative record and information and argument submitted by the affected party or parties.
              (2) A party proposed for debarment:
              (i) Has 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice to respond to the Suspension and Debarment Official or the debarment becomes final.
              (ii) May request and receive a copy of the administrative record that was the basis for the proposed debarment. If information is withheld, the party will be notified and provided the reason.

              (iii) May request the opportunity to present information and argument in person to the Suspension and Debarment Official. The Suspension and Debarment Official will schedule an oral presentation within 20 calendar days of receipt of the request, unless a longer period of time is requested by the party. An oral presentation is informal and a transcript usually is not made. The party may supplement the oral presentation with written information and arguments.
              
              (iv) May identify to the Suspension and Debarment Official material facts in dispute and the bases. For an action other than one based on a conviction of civil judgment, a party may request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official.
              (3) Following a review of the record and, if needed, a presentation by the contractor in opposition to the proposed action, the Suspension and Debarment Official will determine whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact. If so, the Suspension and Debarment Official will initiate the fact-finding process. The fact-finding official will:
              (i) Establish a date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 days of the determination of who will function as the fact-finding official.
              (ii) Grant extensions for good cause.
              (iii) Provide notice of the scheduled hearing.
              (iv) Provide the parties with a schedule for exchange of documents and witness lists.
              (v) Develop an official transcript of the fact-finding proceeding.
              (vi) Provide the Government's representative and the contractor with an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issue. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative.
              (vii) Conduct hearings under rules consistent with FAR 9.406-3 pertaining to fact finding. Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finding official.
              (viii) Provide for witness testimony. Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses are subject to cross examination.
              (ix) Prepare written findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence and submit them to both the Suspension and Debarment Official and the contractor within 20 calendar days following the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding.

              (a) General. The procedures in 509.406-3 apply to suspension actions except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Fact-finding. (1) Fact-finding will not be conducted in an action:
              (i) Based on an indictment.
              (ii) When the Suspension and Debarment Official finds no genuine dispute of material facts.
              (2) If the action is not based on an indictment, the Suspension and Debarment Official must coordinate with the Department of Justice or state prosecutorial authority through OIG. Based on the advice received, the Suspension and Debarment Official will determine if fact-finding would impair substantial interests of the Federal or state Government. In an action not based on an indictment, a suspended party may:
              (i) Identify to the Suspension and Debarment Official material facts in dispute and the bases.
              (ii) Request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official to resolve genuine disputes of material fact. For procedures involving a genuine dispute of material fact, see 509.406-3(d)(3).

              (a) Supplies or services—(1) Shelf-life items. The contracting officer shall use the following clauses in solicitations and contracts that require delivery of shelf-life items within a specified number of months from the date of manufacture or production:
              (i) The contracting officer shall insert 552.211-79, Acceptable Age of Supplies, if the required shelf-life period is 12 months or less, and lengthy acceptance testing may be involved. For items having a limited shelf-life, substitute Alternate I when required by the program director.
              (ii) The contracting officer shall insert 552.211-80, Age on Delivery, if the required shelf-life period is more than 12 months, or when source inspection can be performed within a short time period.
              (2) Stock replenishment contracts. The contracting officer shall insert 552.211-81, Time of Shipment, in solicitations and stock replenishment contracts that do not include the Availability for Inspection, Testing, and Shipment/Delivery clause at 552.211-83 and require shipment within 45 calendar days after receipt of the order. If shipment is required in more than 45 days, the contracting officer shall use Alternate I of 552.211-81.
              (3) Indeterminate testing time. The contracting officer shall insert 552.211-83, Availability for Inspection, Testing, and Shipment/Delivery, in solicitations and contracts that provide for source inspection by Government personnel and that require lengthy testing for which time frames cannot be determined in advance. If the contract is for stock items, the contracting officer shall use Alternate I of 552.211-83.
              (4) Stock program supply delivery time. The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 552.211-94, Time of Delivery, in solicitations and contracts for supplies for the Stock Program when neither of the FAR delivery clauses (FAR 52.211-8 or 52.211-9) is suitable.

              Scope of subpart.

              Pursuant to the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) Delegation 3, the Department of Commerce (DOC) has delegated to GSA the authority to use the DPAS under certain conditions. DPAS Delegation 3 restricts use of DPAS authority to GSA supply system procurement in support of the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Energy (DoE), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved programs.

              511.602
              General.
              (a) The purpose of the DPAS is to assure the timely availability of industrial resources to meet current national defense, energy, and civil emergency preparedness program requirements and to provide an operating system to support rapid industrial response in a national emergency. The primary statutory authority for the DPAS is Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, with additional authority from the Selective Service Act of 1948 and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Executive Orders 12919 and 12742 delegate to the DOC authority to administer the DPAS. Within the DOC, the Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security (SIES) is assigned responsibility for DPAS implementation, administration, and compliance.
              (b) The DPAS is published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 15 CFR part 700. This regulation provides an overview, a detailed explanation of operations and procedures, and other implementing guidance, including information on special priorities assistance and compliance.
              (c) Orders placed under DPAS are “rated orders.” Rated orders must receive preferential treatment only as necessary to meet delivery requirements. Rated orders are identified by a rating symbol of either “DX” or “DO” followed by a program identification symbol. All “DO” rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All “DX” rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over “DO” rated orders and unrated orders. A program identification symbol indicates which approved program is supported by the rated order.
              (d) The authority delegated to GSA shall not be used to support the procurement of any items that—
              (1) Are commonly available in commercial markets for general consumption;
              (2) Do not require major modification when purchased for approved program use;
              (3) Are readily available in sufficient quantity so as to cause no delay in meeting approved program requirements; or
              (4) Are to be used primarily for administrative purposes (including Federal Supply Classification (FSC) classes, groups, or items), such as for personnel or financial management. The Commissioner, FAS, shall issue additional guidance, as may be necessary, to ensure effective implementation of its delegated DPAS authority.

              511.603
              Procedures.
              (a) A DPAS rating may be placed against an entire contract at time of award or an individual order issued under an existing, otherwise unrated, contract. FAR 11.604 requires contracting officers to insert the provision at 52.211-14, Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense, Emergency Preparedness, and Energy Program Use, in solicitations when the contract or order to be awarded will be a rated order and to insert the clause at 52.211-15, Defense Priority and Allocation Requirements, in contracts that are rated orders.

              (b) In addition to the FAR provision and clause referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, the contract or order must include the following (see 15 CFR 700.12):
              (1) The appropriate priority rating symbol (i.e., either “DO” or “DX”) along with the program identification symbol. When GSA contracting officers place DO rated orders, they must use program identification symbol “K1”. When placing a DX-rated order for other agencies, GSA contracting officers must use the requesting agency program identification symbol from the DoD Master Urgency List and may only do so when GSA is acting as the procuring agent for DoD or DoE and has received a “DX” rated contract or order from either department.
              
              (2) A required delivery date. The words “as soon as possible” or “immediately” do not constitute a required delivery date. Use of either a specific date or a specified number of days ARO (after receipt of order) is acceptable.
              (3) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order of an individual authorized to place rated orders.
              (4) A statement that reads substantially as follows: “This is a rated order certified for national defense use, and you are required to follow all the provisions of the Defense Priorities and Allocations System regulation (15 CFR part 700)”.
              (c) Multiple and Single Award Schedule contracts are not rated at time of award.

              Unenforceability of unauthorized obligations.
              GSA has a deviation to FAR 12.216 for this section. For commercial contracts, supplier license agreements are referred to as commercial supplier agreements (defined in 502.101). Paragraph (u) of clause 552.212-4 prevents violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) for supplies or services acquired subject to a commercial supplier agreement.

              512.301
              Solicitation provisions and contract clauses for the acquisition of commercial items.
              (a) Solicitation provisions and clauses. Insert these provisions or clauses in solicitations or solicitations and contracts, respectively, in accordance with the instructions provided:
              (1) 552.212-71, Contract Terms and Conditions Applicable to GSA Acquisition of Commercial Items, when listed clauses apply. The clause provides for incorporation by reference of terms and conditions which are, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with customary commercial practice. If necessary, tailor this clause.
              (2) 552.212-72, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to GSA Acquisitions of Commercial Items, when listed clauses apply. The clause provides for the incorporation by reference of terms and conditions required to implement provisions of law or executive orders that apply to commercial item acquisitions.
              (b) Discretionary use of GSAR provisions and clauses. Consistent with the limitations contained in FAR 12.302(c), include in solicitations and contracts by addendum other GSAR provisions and clauses.
              (c) Use of additional provisions and clauses. The Senior Procurement Executive must approve the use of a provision or clause that is either not:
              (1) Prescribed in the FAR or GSAR for use in contracts for commercial items.
              (2) Consistent with customary commercial practice.

              (d) In solicitations issued in conjunction with the policy and procedures in FAR part 14, Sealed Bidding; or FAR part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, include the two notices in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, except that acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property, must include only the notice in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
              
              (1) The information collection requirements contained in this solicitation/contract are either required by regulation or approved by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB Control No. 3090-0163.
              (2) The General Services Administration's hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Requests for preaward debriefings postmarked or otherwise submitted after 4:30 p.m. will be considered submitted the following business day. Requests for postaward debriefings delivered after 4:30 p.m. will be considered received and filed the following business day.
              (e) GSA has a deviation to revise certain paragraphs of FAR clause 52.212-4. Use clause 552.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (FAR DEVIATION), for acquisitions of commercial items in lieu of FAR 52.212-4 or 52.212-4 Alternate I. The contracting officer may tailor this clause in accordance with FAR 12.302 and GSAM 512.302.

              Bid samples.
              (a) Requirements for samples in invitations for bids. (1) When bid samples are required, the contracting officer shall require bidders to submit samples produced by the manufacturer whose products will be supplied under the contract.
              (2) The FAR limits use of bid samples to cases where the contracting officer cannot describe some characteristics of a product adequately in the specification or purchase description. This usually applies to subjective characteristics. The contracting officer may determine that there is a need to examine objective characteristics of bid samples to determine the responsiveness of a bid. The contracting officer should base the determination on past experience or other valid considerations. In the solicitation, separately list “Subjective Characteristics” and “Objective Characteristics”.
              (3) A provision appears at 552.214-72, Bid Sample Requirements. This provision may be modified to fit the circumstances of a procurement.
              (b) Handling bid samples. (1) Samples from accepted bids must be retained for the period of contract performance. If there are no outstanding claims regarding the contract, the contracting officer may authorize disposal of the samples at the end of the contract term following the bidder's instructions.
              (2) If the contracting officer anticipates a claim regarding the contract, the contracting officer shall require that the bid samples be retained until the claim is resolved.
              (3) The contracting officer shall require that samples from unsuccessful bids be retained until award. After award, these samples may be disposed of following the bidder's instructions.

              Transmittal to prospective bidders.
              Prospective bidders, as used in FAR 14.203-1, include both the following:
              (a) The incumbent contractor, except when its written response to the notice of contract action under FAR subpart 5.2 states a negative interest.
              (b) Bidders that responded to recent solicitations for the same or similar items.

              Definition.
              
                Aggregate award means an arrangement whereby two or more separately-priced line items are combined for award to that bidder whose bid will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government for the line items as a group. The individual price for each item does not have to be the lowest bid received. (See also the definition of a “line item” in FAR 3.302.)
            
            
              514.270-2
              Guidelines for use.

              (a) GSA usually solicits prices and reserves the right to make award for individual line items. In some cases it serves GSA's best interest to combine two or more line items for an aggregate award. Such cases include when:
              (1) Users desire uniformity of design, style, and finish (e.g., suites of household furniture).
              (2) The articles will be assembled and used as a unit, and different manufacturers' components may not be interchangeable.
              (3) Users have high demand for certain articles, but demand for related articles is insufficient to attract competitive bids (e.g., various sized of socket wrenches). Awarding the low-demand articles in conjunction with the high-demand articles may encourage competition.
              (4) Awarding the low-demand articles in conjunction with the high-demand articles may encourage competition.
              (5) One location (delivery point) has a large requirement, and another location has a requirement too small to individually attract competitive bids.
              (6) Awarding and administering numerous small contracts for similar articles or services is impractical.
              (b) Before deciding to combine items for aggregate award, the contracting officer should consider the following factors:
              (1) The capability of bidders to furnish the types and quantities of supplies or services in the aggregate.
              (2) How grouping delivery points will affect bidders.
              (3) Which combinations will accurately project the lowest overall cost to the Government.
              (c) The contracting officer should not use an aggregate award if it will significantly restrict the number of eligible bidders.

              514.270-3
              Evaluation factors for award.
              The solicitation should clearly state the basis for evaluating bids for aggregate award, require bidders to submit a price on each item within the group or a percentage to be added or subtracted from a list price, and advise bidders that failure to submit prices as required within a group makes a bid ineligible for award for that group.

              514.270-4
              Grouping line items for aggregate award.
              (a) Supplies and services. This subsection applies to acquisitions of supplies and services.
              (b) Effect on compeition. Provide for full and open competition when grouping items for award. Grouping items for award may preclude a significant of firms from bidding. This occurs if firms are unable to provide all the types or quanities of supplies or services, or make deliveries to the various delivery points included in the prospective aggregate group.
              (c) Grouping different articles. Include only related articles in an aggregate group. Related articles are those normally manufactured or produced by a majority of prospective bidders. Grouping unrelated articles often restricts competition unnecessarily.
              (d) Grouping geographic locations or delivery points. Consider the following guidelines before deciding to group different geographic locations or delivery points:
              (1) A delivery point may have sufficient requirements so that individual shipments involve economic production runs and carload or truckload quanities. In this case, list it as a separate line item.
              (2) The types of bidders (i.e., small or large firms, manufacturers or distributors, etc.) who responded to previous solicitations can provide important information. For example, if previous bidders are distributors with franchises in certain territories, grouping different territories could tend to restrict competition.
              (3) Transportation costs can affect competition and pricing. They may constitute a significant portion of the total delivered cost. Obtain the advice and assistance of transportation specialists before grouping geographic locations or delivery points. Depending upon the supplies being acquired:

              (i) Grouping widespread geographic locations or delivery points may reduce competition or result in higher prices. It can cause the loss of “area pricing” advantages provided by a supplier with a single production point.
              (ii) Conversely, for many small commercial items (hand tools, locks, etc.), manufacturers may quote the same price for delivery anywhere in the U.S.
              (iii) Tariff boundaries can also affect how manufacturers price deliveries to different areas.

              514.270-5
              Evaluation methodologies for aggregate awards.
              (a) Definite quantity contracts without options. For definite quantity contracts without options, the evaluated bid price is the total bid price, as adjusted for any price-related factors identified in the solicitation. This reflects the actual cost to the Government and will identify the most advantageous bid.
              (b) Indefinite quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and options. Indefinite quantity and requirements contracts use estimated quantities. Options involve the probability of whether and when the options will be exercised. These situations may result in unbalanced bids (see FAR 15.404-1(g)), leading to inaccurate evaluation of the projected cost and award to other than the most advantageous bid. To avoid unbalanced bids, GSA has two preferred methods for evaluating bids for aggregate awards: weight factors and price list.
              (1) Weight factors method. Assign a weight to each item in a group. The weight is based on the portion of quantities that item represents. To evaluate bids, multiply each unit price by its weight factor, then total the results.
              (2) Price list method. Establish prices for bidders to use as a base for preparing their bids. Prepare a list that identifies a base price for each item in a group. Bidders bid a percentage factor to add to or subtract from the base price.
            
            
              514.270-6
              Guidelines for using the weight factors method.
              (a) Use the weight factors method when there are reliable estimates for the quantities needed in an acquisition. Reliable estimates of quantities form the foundation for:
              (1) Accurate evaluation of the projected cost of each bid.
              (2) An appropriate determination of which bid is most advantageous to the Government for the aggregate group.
              (b) Assign a weight factor to each item in a group. Develop the weight factor by calculating the portion of the total quantity in a defined group that each item represents.
              (c) To evaluate bid prices, first multiply the price bid for each item (unit price X quantity) by its weight factor. Then, add the subtotals together to project the cost for the aggregate group.
              (d) Estimated quantities may be reduced to smaller numbers by a common denominator. This may help facilitate the computations involved in evaluating bids.
              (e) Consider all price-related factors identified in the solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible bidder with the lowest evaluated overall cost to the Government for the aggregate group. This represents the most advantageous bid.
              [64 FR 37211, July 9, 1999, as amended at 74 FR 47739, Sept. 17, 2009]
            
            
              514.270-7
              Guidelines for using the price list method.
              (a) General. The price list method helps avoid unbalanced bidding when making aggregate awards, but lack accurate estimates of anticipated quantities. This method establishes base prices for bidders to use in preparing their bids.
              (b) Solicitation requirements. When using the price list method, in the solicitation:
              (1) Include the price list.
              (2) Include an estimate of requirements.

              (3) Require the bidder to express its price as “net” or as a percentage added to or subtracted from the list prices for each group. Require the bidder to quote only one percentage factor for each group. This means that the bidder provides one percentage factor that applies to every item in a group; not a separate percentage for each item. “Net” indicates the bidder chooses to submit the list prices as its bid.
              
              (4) Identify the percentage factor in paragraph (b)(3) of this section as a price related evaluation factor.
              (c) Developing list prices. Price lists may be developed using one or more of the following sources:
              (1) Industry published prices.
              (2) Industry surveys.
              (3) Government cost estimates based on knowledge of the supplies or services and previous contract prices.
              (d) First time use for an item or service. The first time the contracting officer uses list prices for an item or service, give prospective bidders an opportunity to review the proposed list. Also provide information on how GSA will use the list prices. This information may be provided in a draft solicitation.
              (e) Balanced prices. Ensure that the list prices for the grouped items bear a reasonable and balanced relationship to one another. Prices may be used from previous awards made using the weight factors method to develop price lists. Review those prices first to ensure they did not result from unbalanced bidding.
              (f) Evaluation and award. Consider all price-related factors identified in the solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible bidder whose percentage factor produces the most favorable price to the Government. This represents the most advantageous bid.
              (g) Example. The following illustrates a bidding schedule arrangement for a group of items for aggregate award under the price list method:
              
                Drills, Twist, High Speed, Under Federal Specification (No. and Date), and Amendment (No. and Date), Amendment (No. and Date) Wire Gauge Sizes, Straight Shank, Short Length, Type C

              The bid on each item above is the list price shown minus/plus __ percent. (Bidder, insert “net” or a single percentage amount in the blank space and cross out minus or plus, as appropriate.)
              (h) Special considerations for contracts for store stock items. Show estimated quantities only if estimates of demand for each item within a group can be derived from Government records or verified contractor sales reports. Use only current estimates. If the Government's needs cannot be estimated, the solicitation may include past orders. (See CG Decision, B-209037, 82-2 CPD para 323 (1982).)
              (i) Special considerations for repair and alteration contracts. In the solicitation:
              (1) List the estimated quantities for work to be performed during both normal working hours and outside of normal working hours.
              (2) State the percent of work anticipated to be performed during normal working hours.
              (3) List the unit prices for work to be performed during both normal working hours and outside of normal working hours.
              (4) Define “normal” in terms of hours and days of the week.
              (5) Advise bidders of the previous year's total expenditures or portions of that total attributable to the listed items.
              (6) If providing quantity estimates, state that the estimates are for information only and do not constitute guarantees or commitments to order items under the contract.

              (7) Solicit two percentage factors for the line item unit prices listed: one for the unit prices for work performed during normal working hours and the second for the unit prices for work performed outside of normal working hours.
              
              (8) When the solicitation further groups unit prices by trade or business category, multiple percentages may be required.
              (9) For the evaluated bid price, add together the following percentages:
              (i) The percentage of work performed during normal work hours multiplied by the total estimate adjusted by the bidder's percentage factor for that portion of the work, plus
              (ii) The percentage of work performed during other than normal working hours multiplied by the total estimate adjusted by the bidder's percentage factor for that portion of the work.
              (10) Consider other price-related factors identified in the solicitation. Make award to the responsible and responsive bidder submitting the lowest overall evaluated bid price for the aggregate group. This represents the most advantageous bid.

                For proposals submitted in response to GAS solicitation no. ____, I agree to the following:
                (a) To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest exists that may either:
                (1) Diminish my capacity to impartially review the proposals submitted.
                (2) Or result in a biased opinion or unfair advantage.
                (b) In making the above statement, I have considered all the following factors that might place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the evaluation proceedings:
                (1) All my stocks, bonds, other outstanding financial interests or commitments.
                (2) All my employment arrangements (past, present, and under consideration).
                (3) As far as I know, all financial interests and employment arrangements of my spouse, minor children, and other members of my immediate household.
                (c) I have read and understand the requirements of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR Part 2635) and Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the General Service Administration (5 CFR Part 6701).
                (d) I have a continuing obligation to disclose any circumstances that may create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. If I learn of any such conflict, I will report it immediately to the Contracting Officer. I will perform no more duties related to evaluating proposals until I receive instructions on the matter.
                (e) I will use proposal information for evaluation purposes only. I understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed on the proposal by the prospective contractor, prospective subcontractor, or the Government applies to any reproduction or abstracted information of the proposal.
                (f) I will use my best efforts to safeguard proposal information physically. I will not disclose the contents of, nor release any information about, the proposals to anyone other than:

                (2) Other individuals designed by the contracting Officer.
                (g) After completing evaluation, I will return to the Government all copies of the proposals and any abstracts.

                (h) GSA Appropriations Act restriction: These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958; section 7211 of title 5, United States Code (governing disclosure of Congress); section 1034 of title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); section 2302(b)(8) of title 5, United States Codes, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 et seq.)

YES_ NO_. If YES, explain deviations in accordance with the instructions at Figure 515.4, which is provided in this solicitation for your convenience.

                (5) If you are a dealer/reseller without significant sales to the general public, you should provide manufacturers' information required by paragraphs (1) through (4) above for each item/SINoffered, if the manufacturer's sales under any resulting contract are expected to exceed $500,000. You must also obtain written authorization from the manufacturer(s) for Government access, at any time before award or before agreeing to a modification, to the manufacturer's sales records for the purpose of verifying the information submitted by the manufacturer. The information is required in order to enable the Government to make a determination that the offered price is fair and reasonable. To expedite the review and processing of offers, you should advise the manufacturer(s) of this requirement. The contracting officer may require the information be submitted on electronic media with commercially available spreadsheet(s). The information may be provided by the manufacturer directly to the Government. If the manufacturer's item(s) is being offered by multiple dealers/resellers, only one copy of the requested information should be submitted to the Government. In addition, you must submit the following information along with a listing of contact information regarding each of the manufacturers whose products and/or services are included in the offer (include the manufacturer's name, address, the manufacturer's contact point, telephone number, and FAX number) for each model offered by SIN:

              (End of format)
              
              (c) When the contract contains the basic clause 552.238-80 Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting, include the instructions for completing the commercial sales practices format in Figure 515.4-2 in solicitations issued under the MAS program. Offerors are not required to complete the commercial sales practices disclosure for order-level materials (See subpart 538.72).
              
                Figure 515.4—Instructions for Commercial Sales Practices Format
                If you responded “yes” to question (3), on the Commercial Sales Practices Format in paragraph (b) of this section, complete the chart in question (4)(a) for the customer(s) who receive your best discount. If you responded “no”, complete the chart in question (4)(a) showing your written policies or standard sales practices for all customers or customer categories to whom you sell at a price (discounts and concessions in combination) that is equal to or better than the price(s) offered to the Government under this solicitation or with which the Offeror has a current agreement to sell at a discount which equals or exceeds the discount(s) offered under this solicitation. Such agreement shall be in effect on the date the offer is submitted or contain an effective date during the proposed multiple award schedule contract period. If your offer is lower than your price to other customers or customers categories, you will be aligned with the customer or category of customer that receives your best price for purposes of the Price Reductions clause at 552.238-81. The Government expects you to provide information required by the format in accordance with these instructions that is, to the best of your knowledge and belief, current, accurate, and complete as of 14 calendar days prior to its submission. You must also disclose any changes in your price list(s), discounts and/or discounting policies which occur after the offer is submitted, but before the close of negotiations. If your discount practices vary by model or product line, the discount information should be by model or product line as appropriate. You may limit the number of models or product lines reported to those which exceed 75% of actual historical Government sales (commercial sales may be substituted if Government sales are unavailable) value of the special item number (SIN).
                Column 1—Identify the Applicable Customer or Category of Customer
                A “customer” is any entity, except the Federal Government, which acquires supplies or services from the Offeror. The term customer includes, but is not limited to original equipment manufacturers, value added resellers, state and local Governments, distributors, educational institutions (an elementary, junior high, or degree granting school which maintains a regular faculty and established curriculum and an organized body of students), dealers, national accounts, and end users. In any instance where the Offeror is asked to disclose information for a customer, the Offeror may disclose information by category of customer if the Offeror's discount policies or practices are the same for all customers in the category. (Use a separate line for each customer or category of customer.)
                Column 2—Identify the Discount

                The term “discount” is as defined in solicitation clause 552.212-70, Preparation of Offer (Multiple Award Schedule). Indicate the best discount (based on your written discounting policies or standard commercial discounting practices if you do not have written discounting policies) at which you sell to the customer or category of customer identified in column 1, without regard to quantity; terms and conditions of the agreements under which the discounts are given; and whether the agreements are written or oral. Net prices or discounts off of other price lists should be expressed as percentage discounts from the price list which is the basis of your offer. If the discount disclosed is a combination of various discounts (prompt payment, quantity, etc.), the percentage should be broken out for each type of discount. If the price lists which are the basis of the discounts given to the customers identified in the chart are different than the price list submitted upon which your offer is based, identify the type or title and date of each price list. The contracting officer may require submission of these price lists. To expedite evaluation, offerors may provide these price lists at the time of submission.
                
                Column 3—Identify the Quantity or Volume of Sales
                Insert the minimum quantity or sales volume which the identified customer or category of customer must either purchase/order, per order or within a specified period, to earn a discount indicate the time period.
                Column 4—Indicate the FOB Delivery Term for Each Identified Customer
                See FAR 47.3 for an explanation of FOB delivery terms.
                Column 5—Indicate Concessions Regardless of Quantity Granted to the Identified Customer or Category of Customer
                Concessions are defined in solicitation clause 552.12-70, Preparation of Offers (Multiple Award Schedule). If the space provided is inadequate, the disclosure should be made on a separate sheet by reference.
                If you respond “yes” to question 4(b) in the Commercial Sales Practices Format, provide an explanation of the circumstances under which you deviate from your written policies or standard commercial sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices Format and explain how often they occur. Your explanation should include a discussion of situations that lead to deviations from standard practice, an explanation of how often they occur, and the controls you employ to assure the integrity of your pricing. Examples of typical deviations may include, but are not limited to, one time goodwill discounts to charity organizations or to compensate an otherwise disgruntled customer; a limited sale of obsolete or damaged goods; the sale of sample goods to a new customer, or the sales of prototype goods for testing purposes.
                If deviations from your written policies or standard commercial sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices Format are so significant and/or frequent that the Contracting Officer cannot establish whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable, then you may be asked to provide additional information. The Contracting Officer may ask for information to demonstrate that you have made substantial sales of the item(s) in the commercial market consistent with the information reflected on the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices Format, a description of the conditions surrounding those sales deviations, or other information that may be necessary in order for the Contracting Officer to determine whether your offered price(s) is fair and reasonable. In cases where additional information is requested the Contracting Officer will target the request in order to limit the submission of data to that needed to establish the reasonableness of the offered price.
                (End of figure)
                (d) When the contract contains the basic clause 552.238-80 Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting, insert the clause at 552.215-72, Price Adjustment—Failure to Provide Accurate Information, in solicitations and contracts under the MAS program.
                (e) Use Alternate IV of FAR 52.215-21, Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data—Modifications, to provide for submission of information other than cost or pricing data for MAS contracts. To provide for uniformity in requests under the MAS program, insert the following in paragraph (b) of the clause:
                (1) Information required by the clause at 552.238-81, Modifications (Multiple Award Schedule).
                (2) Any additional supporting information requested by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may require additional supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable.
                (3) By submitting a request for modification, the Contractor grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine, at any time before agreeing to a modification, books, record, documents, papers, and other directly pertinent records to verify the pricing, sales and other data related to the supplies or services proposed in order to determine the reasonableness of price(s). Access does not extent to Contractor's cost or profit information or other data related solely to the Contractor's determination of the prices to be offered in the catalog or marketplace.

              (1) If the contract includes one or more options to extend the term of the contract, use the clause with its Alternate I or a clause substantially the same as 552.216-71 with its Alternate I suitably modified.
              (2) In a contract requiring a minimum adjustment before the price adjustment mechanism is effectuated, use the basic clause with Alternate II or with Alternate I and Alternate II.
              (3) If the Producer Price Index is not an appropriate indicator for price adjustment, modify the clause to use an alternate indicator for adjusting prices. Similarly, if other aspects of 552.216-71 are not appropriate, use an alternate clause following established procedures.
              (b) Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material. (1) If the contracting officer decides to provide for adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material, prepare a clause that defines each of the following elements:
              (i) The type of labor and/or material subject to adjustment;
              (ii) The labor rates, including any fringe benefits and/or unit prices of materials that may be increased or decreased;
              (iii) The index(es) that will be used to measure changes in price levels and the base period or reference point from which changes will be measured; and
              (iv) The period during which the price(s) will be subject to adjustment.
              (2) The contracting director must approve use of this clause.

              Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.
              (a) In solicitations and contracts for Special Order Program items, when the contract authorizes FAS and other activities to issue delivery or task orders, insert the clause at 552.216-72, Placement of Orders. If only FAS will issue delivery or task orders, insert the clause with its Alternate I.

              (b) In solicitations and contracts for multiple-award contracts where GSA is the only ordering activity, or for GSA orders placed against a GSA multiple-award contract, insert clause 552.216-74, GSA Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman. This clause shall not be included in GSA-awarded contracts available for multiple agency use (i.e., Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts, Multi-Agency Contracts); instead, see paragraph (d) of this section.
              (c) If the clause at 552.216-72 is prescribed, insert the provision at 552.216-73, Ordering Information, in solicitations for Special Order Program items and in other FAS Program solicitations.

              (d) Insert clause 552.216-76, Ordering Agency Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman in all GSA-awarded contracts available for multiple agency use (i.e., Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts, Multi-Agency Contracts).
              (e) The Contracting Officer may insert clause 552.216-75 in solicitations and GSA-awarded IDIQ contracts, not including Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts. This clause should be included in all GSA-awarded Governmentwide acquisition contracts and multi-agency contracts. See 538.273 for clauses applicable to FSS contracts.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this subpart applies to contracts for supplies and services, including architect-engineer services.
              (b) Policies and procedures for the use of options in solicitation provisions and contract clauses for services involving construction, alteration, or repair (including dredging, excavating, and painting) of buildings, bridges, roads, or other kinds of real property are prescribed in 536.270.

              Use of options.
              (a) Options may be used when they meet one or more of the following objectives:
              (1) Reduce procurement lead time and associated costs.
              (2) Ensure continuity of contract support.
              (3) Improve overall contractor performance.
              (4) Facilitate longer term contractual relationships with those contractors that continually meet or exceed quality performance expectations.
              (b) An option is normally in the Government's interest in the following circumstances:
              (1) There is an anticipated need for additional supplies or services during the contract term.
              (2) When there is both a need for additional supplies or services beyond the basic contract period and the use of multi-year contracting authority is inappropriate.
              (3) There is a need for continuity of supply or service support.
              (c) An option shall not be used if the market price is likely to change substantially and an economic price adjustment clause inadequately protects the Government's interest.

              In addition to the requirements of FAR 17.207, the Contracting Officer must also:
              (a) Document the contract file with the rationale for an extended contractual relationship if the contractor's performance rating under the contract is less than satisfactory.
              (b) Determine that the option price is fair and reasonable.

              (1) The solicitation contains an option to extend the term of the contract.

              (2) The contract will be fixed price and contain an economic price adjustment clause.
              
              (b) Insert the provision at 552.217-71, Notice Regarding Option(s), or a similar provision, in solicitations that include an option for increased quantities of supplies or services or an option to extend.

              Goals for the employment of minorities and women in the construction industry are established by the Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), Department of Labor. The current goal for the utilization of women is 6.9%, regardless of the location of the Federal contract. This goal was extended indefinitely by the Department of Labor in 1980. The current goals for minority participation vary by location and are listed in the Technical Assistance Guide for Construction Participation Goals for Minorities and Females. This guide can be accessed at http://www.dol.gov/ofccp/index.htm.

              For contracts of the type shown in 532.7201(a)(1) through (4):
              (a) Contractors are to submit invoices or vouchers to the contracting officer for approval. Invoices must be annotated with the date of receipt, as required by FAR 32.905. That date will be used to determine interest penalties for late payments. The contracting officer or designee must review the processing of invoices or vouchers before payment to determine if the items and amounts claimed are consistent with the contract terms and represent prudent business transactions. The contracting officer must ensure that these payments are commensurate with physical and technical progress under the contract. If the contractor has not deducted questionable amounts from the invoice or amounts required to be withheld, the contracting officer must make the required deduction, except as provided in 532.7203. Subject to 532.7201, the contracting officer must note approval of any payment on (or attached to) the invoice or voucher submitted by the contractor and forward the invoice or voucher to the appropriate contract finance office for retention after certification and scheduling for payment by a disbursing office.

              The following procedures apply to construction and building service contracts:
              (a) The Government shall pay the final amount due the Contractor under this contract after the documentation in the payment clauses of the contract is submitted. This includes the final release prescribed for construction at FAR 52.232-5, and for building services at GSAR 552.232-72.
              (b) Contracting officers may not process the final payment on construction or building service contracts until the contractor submits a properly executed GSA Form 1142, Release of Claims, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) In cases where, after 60 days from the initial attempt, the contracting officer is unable to obtain a release of claims from the contractor, the final payment may be processed with the approval of assigned legal counsel.
              (d) The amount of final payment must include, as appropriate, deductions to cover any of the following:

Before exercising the authority to modify the date for constructive acceptance or constructive approval of progress payments in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.232-25, Prompt Payment, the contracting officer must prepare a written justification explaining why a longer period is necessary. An official one level above the contracting officer must approve the justification. The time needed should be determined on a case-by-case basis, but the specified constructive acceptance period shall not exceed 30 days.
              (c) Stock, Special Order, and Schedules Programs. (1) GSA has obtained a FAR Deviation to authorize payment within 10 days of receipt of a proper invoice. The authority applies only to:
              (i) Orders placed by GSA under the referenced programs;
              (ii) That include FAR 52.232-33, Mandatory Information for Electronic Funds Transfer Payment; and
              (iii) For which the order is placed, and the contractor submits invoices, using EDI in accordance with the Trading Partner Agreement.
              (2) If the contract is for commercial items and will include FAR 52.212-4, use the clause with its Alternate II. If the contract is not for commercial items, use the clause at 552.232-25, Prompt Payment, instead of FAR 52.232-25.

              532.7002
              Solicitation requirements.
              (a) In solicitations for supplies and services, except FSS schedule solicitations, request offerors to indicate if they will accept payment by Governmentwide commercial purchase card. Identify the card brand(s) under the GSA SmartPay program that may be used to make payments under the contract, on the cover page or in Section L of the solicitation.
              (b) For FSS schedule contracts, identify the card brand(s) under the GSA SmartPay program that may be used to make payments under the contract in the contract award letter.
              (c) For orders placed by GSA, you may authorize payment by Governmentwide commercial purchase card only for orders that do not exceed $100,000 (see GSA Order, Guidance on Use of the Credit Card for Purchases (CFO 4200.1)).

              (d) Consider requesting offerors to designate different levels for which they may accept payment by Governmentwide commercial purchase card, for example:
              
              

                “If awarded a contract under this solicitation, the offeror agrees to accept payment by Governmentwide commercial purchase card for orders of:
                
                —$2,500 or less
                —$25,000 or less
                —$50,000 or less
                —$100,000 or less”

              Contract clause.
              For indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts other than Schedules, insert the clause at 552.232-77, Payment By Government Charge Card, if the contract will provide for payment by Government charge card as an alternative method of payment for orders. For Schedule contracts that provide for payment using the Government charge card, use the clause(s) prescribed at part 538.

              533.103-1
              Filing a protest.

              (a) Any protester filing an agency protest has the choice of requesting either that the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest is silent on this matter, the contracting officer will decide the protest. If a party requests a review at a level above the contracting officer, the Agency Protest Official will decide the protest. The decision by the Agency Protest Official for GSA is an alternative to a decision by the contracting officer on a protest. The Agency Protest Official for GSA will not consider an appeal of the contracting officer's decision on an agency protest.
              (b) If an agency protest is filed, the deciding official uses the procedures in FAR 33.103 and this section to resolve the protest. The deciding official will provide a fair and quick review of any protest filed with the agency.
              (c) The filing timeframes in FAR 33.103(e) apply. An agency protest is filed when the complete protest is received at the location the solicitation designates for serving protests. GSA's hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Protests delivered after 4:30 p.m. will be considered received and filed the following business day.
              (d) The protest must meet all the following conditions:
              (1) Include the information required by FAR 33.103(d)(2).
              (2) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.
              (3) Be filed in writing with the contracting officer.
              (4) State whether the protester chooses to have the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest does not include the protester's choice, then the contracting officer will decide the protest (see paragraph (a) of this subsection).
              (e) The following procedures apply to information submitted in support of or in response to an agency protest:
              (1) GSA procedures do not provide for any discovery.
              (2) The deciding official has discretion to request additional information from either the agency or the protester, orally or in writing, as may be necessary to render a timely decision on the protest. However, protests are normally decided on the basis of information initially provided by the protester and the agency.
              (3) To the extent permitted by law and regulations, the parties may exchange relevant information.
              (4) The agency must make a written response to the protest within ten days unless another date is set by the deciding official.

              (5) The agency must also provide the protester with a copy of the response on the same day it files the protest response with the deciding official. If the agency believes it needs to redact or withhold any information in the response from the protester, it should identify and provide the information to the deciding official for in camera review.
              (f) A protester may represent itself or be represented by legal counsel. GSA will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.
              (g) GSA may dismiss or stay proceedings on an agency protest if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum outside of GSA.

              Applicability.
              This part supplements FAR Part 36 policies and procedures applicable to contracting for construction and architect-engineer services. Contracts for construction management services are covered by FAR Part 37 and GSAM Part 537. Part 536 shall take precedence when the acquisition involves (1) construction or architect-engineer services, and (2) when the requirement is inconsistent with another part of the GSAR.

              Options in construction contracting.
            
            
              536.270-1
              Use of options.
              (a) Subject to the limitations in this section, contracting officers may include options in contracts when it is in the Government's interest.
              (b) The scope of work in the base contract at award shall require the contractor to provide a discrete and fully functional deliverable. Options shall not be used to incrementally deliver work required to fulfill the requirements of the scope of work for the base contract.
              (c) Contracting officers shall justify in writing the use of options.
              (d) Including an option may be in the Government's interest when, in the judgment of the contracting officer:
              (1) Additional work beyond the base contract is reasonably foreseeable;
              (2) It would not be advantageous to award a separate contract;
              (3) It would not be advantageous to permit an additional contractor to work on the same site;
              (4) Services arising out of or relating to the underlying construction contract may be required during or after substantial completion of the scope of work. For instance, if building equipment (e.g., mechanical and electrical equipment) will be installed under the construction contract, it may be advantageous to have the construction contractor maintain and service the equipment. In such an instance, the services performed may be included as an option to the underlying construction contract. Contracting officers shall ensure that the applicable clauses are included in any such option (e.g., Service Contract Act); or
              (5) It is otherwise justified.

              (e) Options for construction work may provide for an economic price adjustment based on cost or price indexes of labor or materials (see FAR 16.203-4(d)). Subject to the approval of the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA), the contracting officer may develop and insert a project-specific price adjustment clause into the solicitation.
            
            
              536.270-2
              Solicitations.
              Solicitations containing options shall:
              (a) Include appropriate option provisions and clauses when resulting contracts will provide for the exercise of options (see 536.270-5);
              (b) State the period within which the options may be exercised; and
              (c) State whether the basis of evaluation is inclusive or exclusive of the options (if exclusive, see 536.270-4(c)).
            
            
              536.270-3
              Evaluation.
              For sealed bidding that includes options:
              (a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder offering the lowest aggregate price for the base bid and all options designated to be evaluated.
              (b) Before opening bids that include options, the contracting officer must determine, and record in the contract file, the amount of funds available for the project. The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the bid opening. This amount may be increased later when determining the items to be awarded to the low bidder if the following condition is met: The award amount of the base bid and evaluated options does not exceed the amount offered for the base bid, the evaluated options, and the same combination of items by any other responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation. This requirement prevents the displacement of the low bidder by manipulating the options to be used.
            
            
              536.270-4
              Exercise of options.
              (a) The contracting officer shall exercise options in writing within the time period specified in the contract.
              (b) The contracting officer may exercise options only after determining, in writing, that all the following conditions exist:
              (1) Funds are available.
              (2) The requirement covered by the option fulfills an existing Government need.
              (3) Exercising the option is the most advantageous method of satisfying the Government's need, price and other factors considered.
              (4) The contractor is not listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions (see FAR 9.405-1).
              (5) The contractor's performance under the contract met or exceeded the Government's expectation for quality performance, unless another circumstance justifies an extended contractual relationship.
              (6) Exercising the option is in accordance with the terms of the option.
              (7) The option price is fair and reasonable, unless already determined as such (e.g., at time of award).
              (c) The contract modification, or other written document which notifies the contractor of the exercise of the option, must cite the option clause as authority. If exercising an unpriced or unevaluated option, cite the statutory authority permitting the use of other than full and open competition (see FAR 6.302).
              (d) When the contract provides for economic price adjustment and the contractor requests a revision of the price, the contracting officer shall determine the effect of the adjustment on prices under the option before the option is exercised.

              (b) Insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 552.236-75, Evaluation Exclusive of Options, in solicitations for fixed-price construction contracts when the solicitation includes an option clause and options will not be included in the evaluation for award purposes.

              (c) Insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 552.236-76, Basis of Award-Sealed Bidding Construction, in solicitations for fixed-price construction contracts when contracting by sealed bidding.

              (d) Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 552.236-77, Government's Right to Exercise Options, in solicitations and contracts for construction that include options.

              536.602-1
              Selection criteria.
              (a) FAR 36.602-1 requires that agencies include “location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of locality of the project” as one of several selection criteria.
              (1) Do not use this evaluation factor as a minimum qualification requirement for determining whether a firm is eligible to compete for a proposed project.

              (2) This factor must not exceed 5 percent of the total weight of all evaluation criteria. In order to receive maximum score for this factor, the architect-engineer firm(s) must demonstrate that at least 35 percent of the architect-engineer contract services (based on the total contract price) will be accomplished within the geographical boundaries established for the project.
              (3) Under an approved class deviation from FAR 36.602-1(a)(5), this factor does not apply to projects that the Chief Architect of GSA determines have national significance.
              (b) The public announcement (FedBizOpps notice) for a proposed project should identify the general geographical area of the project by either:
              (1) A radius in miles or other appropriate unit of measure.
              (2) The Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, county(ies), state(s) surrounding the project, or other appropriate geographic boundaries.
              (c) Architect-engineer selections under the Design Excellence Program must apply the geographical evaluation criteria in the second phase.
              (d) The public announcement (FedBizOpps notice) must provide the number of calendar days the architect-engineer of record has to establish a production capability within the general geographical area of the project. You may allow the architect-engineer of record up to 45 calendar days after contract award to establish this production capability.

              538.270-1
              Evaluation of offers without access to transactional data.
              (a) Applicability. Utilize this evaluation methodology for negotiating MAS offers when the commercial sales practices format is included in the solicitation (see 515.408).
              (b) When offerors have commercial catalogs, negotiate concessions from established catalogs, including price and non-price terms and conditions.
              (c) The Government will seek to obtain the offeror's best price (the best price given to the most favored customer). However, the Government recognizes that the terms and conditions of commercial sales vary and there may be legitimate reasons why the best price is not achieved.
              (d) Establish negotiation objectives based on a review of relevant data and determine price reasonableness.
              (e) When establishing negotiation objectives and determining price reasonableness, compare the terms and conditions of the MAS solicitation with the terms and conditions of agreements with the offeror's commercial customers. When determining the Government's price negotiation objectives, consider the following factors:
              (1) Aggregate volume of anticipated purchases.
              (2) The purchase of a minimum quantity or a pattern of historic purchases.
              (3) Prices taking into consideration any combination of discounts and concessions offered to commercial customers.
              (4) Length of the contract period.
              (5) Warranties, training, and/or maintenance included in the purchase price or provided at additional cost to the product prices.
              (6) Ordering and delivery practices.

              (7) Any other relevant information, including differences between the MAS solicitation and commercial terms and conditions that may warrant differentials between the offer and the discounts offered to the most favored commercial customer(s). For example, an offeror may incur more expense selling to the Government than to the customer who receives the offeror's best price, or the customer (e.g., dealer, distributor, original equipment manufacturer, other reseller) who receives the best price may perform certain value-added functions for the offeror that the Government does not perform. In such cases, some reduction in the discount given to the Government may be appropriate. If the best price is not offered to the Government, you should ask the offeror to identify and explain the reason for any differences. Do not require offerors to provide detailed cost breakdowns.
              (f) You may award a contract containing pricing which is less favorable than the best price the offeror extends to any commercial customer for similar purchases if you make a determination that both of the following conditions exist:
              (1) The prices offered to the Government are fair and reasonable, even though comparable discounts were not negotiated.
              (2) Award is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.
              (g) State clearly in the award document the price/discount relationship between the Government and the identified commercial customer (or category of customers) upon which the award is based.

              FSS contract awards.
              (a) FSS awards will be for commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101.
              (b) Before awarding any FSS contract, determine that the offered prices are fair and reasonable (see FAR subpart 15.4 and 538.270). Document the negotiation and your determination using FAR 15.406-3 as guidance.

              538.272
              FSS price reductions.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies when the contract contains the basic clause 552.238-80 Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting.
              (b) The basic clause and Alternate I of 552.238-81, Price Reductions, requires the contractor to maintain during the contract period the negotiated price/discount relationship (and/or term and condition relationship) between the eligible ordering activities and the offeror's customer or category of customers on which the contract award was predicated (see 538.271(c)). If a change occurs in the contractor's commercial pricing or discount arrangement applicable to the identified commercial customer (or category of customers) that results in a less advantageous relationship between the eligible ordering activities and this customer or category of customers, the change constitutes a “price reduction.”
              (c) Ensure that the contractor understands the requirements of section 552.238-75 and agrees to report all price reductions to the Contracting Officer as provided for in the clause.

              538.7001
              Definitions.
              
                Ordering activity (also called “ordering agency” and “ordering office”) means an eligible ordering activity (see 552.238-113) authorized to place orders under Federal supply schedule contracts.
              
                Preparedness means actions that may include, but are not limited to planning, resourcing, training, exercising, and organizing to build, sustain, and improve operational disaster response capabilities. Preparedness also includes the process of identifying the personnel, training, and equipment needed for a wide range of potential incidents, and developing jurisdiction-specific plans for delivering capabilities when needed for an incident.
              
                Recovery means actions including, but not limited to, the development, coordination, and execution of service- and site-restoration plans; the reconstitution of Government operations and services; individual, private-sector, nongovernmental, and public-assistance programs to provide housing and to promote restoration; long-term care and treatment of affected persons; additional measures for social, political, environmental, and economic restoration; evaluation of the incident to identify lessons learned; post-incident reporting; and development of initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents.
              
                Relief means disaster “response” and “recovery.” Please see the full definitions for these terms in this section.
              
                Response means immediate actions taken during a disaster, or in its immediate aftermath, in order to save lives, protect property and the environment, and meet basic human needs. Response also includes the execution of emergency plans and actions to support short-term recovery.
              
                Schedule 70, as used in this subpart, means Schedule 70 information technology contracts, and Consolidated Products and Services Schedule contracts containing information technology SINs. The Consolidated Products and Services Schedule is a compilation of multiple individual Federal Supply Schedules; therefore, only the SINs that fall under Schedule 70 of the Consolidated Products and Services Schedule will apply to Cooperative Purchasing. No other Schedules, or SINs, containing information technology outside of Schedule 70 SINs, and Consolidated Products and Services Schedule contracts containing Schedule 70 SINs, will apply.
              
                Schedule 84 means the Federal Supply Schedule for alarm and signal systems, facility management systems, firefighting and rescue equipment, law enforcement and security equipment, marine craft and related equipment, special purpose clothing, and related services (as contained in Federal Supply Classification Code Group 84 or any amended or subsequent version of that Federal supply classification group).
              
                State and local government entities, as used in this subpart, means the states of the United States, counties, municipalities, cities, towns, townships, tribal governments, public authorities (including public or Indian housing agencies under the United States Housing Act of 1937), school districts, colleges and other institutions of higher education, council of governments (incorporated or not), regional or interstate government entities, or any agency or instrumentality of the preceding entities (including any local educational agency or institution of higher education), and including legislative and judicial departments. The term does not include contractors of, or grantees of, State or local governments.
              (1) Local educational agency has the meaning given that term in section 8013 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7713).
              (2) Institution of higher education has the meaning given that term in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)).
              (3) Tribal government means—
              (i) The governing body of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community located in the continental United States (excluding the State of Alaska) that is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; and

              (ii) Any Alaska Native regional or village corporation established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).

                Preparing solicitations when schedules are open to eligible non-federal entities.
                When opening authorized Federal Supply Schedules for use by eligible non-federal entities, the contracting officer must make minor modifications to certain Federal Acquisition Regulation and GSAM provisions and clauses in order to make clear distinctions between the rights and responsibilities of the U.S. Government in its management and regulatory capacity pursuant to which it awards schedule contracts and fulfills associated Federal requirements versus the rights and responsibilities of eligible ordering activities placing orders to fulfill agency needs. Accordingly, the contracting officer is authorized to modify the following FAR provisions/clauses to delete “Government” or similar language referring to the U.S. Government and substitute “ordering activity” or similar language when preparing solicitations and contracts to be awarded under authorized Federal Supply Schedules. When such changes are made, the word “(DEVIATION)” shall be added at the end of the title of the provision or clause. These clauses include but are not limited to:

              (a) GSA must provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source. Section 3544(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) describes Federal agency security responsibilities as including “information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency.”
              (b) Employees responsible for or procuring information technology supplies, services and systems shall possess the appropriate security clearance associated with the level of security classification related to the acquisition. They include, but are not limited to contracting officers, contract specialists, project/program managers, and contracting officer representatives.
              (c) Contracting activities shall coordinate with requiring activities and program officials to ensure that the solicitation documents include the appropriate information security requirements. The information security requirements must be sufficiently detailed to enable service providers to fully understand the information security regulations, mandates, and requirements that they will be subject to under the contract or task order.

              (d) GSA's Office of the Senior Agency Information Security Officer issued CIO IT Security Procedural Guide 09-48, “Security Language for Information Technology Acquisitions Efforts,” to provide IT security standards, policies and reporting requirements that shall be inserted in all solicitations and contracts or task orders where an information system is contractor owned and operated on behalf of the Federal Government.

              552.101-70
              Using part 552.
              (a) Definition. “Clause,” as used in this subpart, means provision or clause as defined in FAR 52.101(a).
              (b) Numbering. (1) Clauses which are “substantially” the same as FAR clauses and clauses to be used instead of FAR clauses are identified as follows:
              (i) The clause has the same title as a clause in the FAR.
              (ii) The number 5 precedes the clause.
              (iii) The clause appears under the same subsection number and caption as in the FAR.
              (2) Supplemental clauses are numbered in the same manner as the FAR, except:
              (i) The chapter number precedes the clause.
              (ii) The subsection numbers begin with 70.
              (iii) The clauses are sequentially numbered, e.g., 552.232-70, 552.232-71, etc.

              552.104
              Procedures for modifying and completing provisions and clauses.
              (a) The procedures in FAR 52.104 apply when you modify or complete a GSAR provision or clause. Provisions and clauses shall not be modified unless the GSAR authorizes their modification.
              (b) You do not need to identify modifications of clauses which result from negotiations unless you issue an amendment to the solicitation.
              (c) In general, you should modify FAR or GSAR clauses only for individual cases. If a contracting activity develops a modification for repeated use, furnish a copy to the Office of GSA Acquisition Policy (MV) for potential inclusion in the GSAR.

                (2) There may be different completion dates required for different phases or portions of the work, as established in the contract. However, the work shall be deemed “substantially complete” if and only if the Contractor has completed the work and related contract obligations in accordance with the contract documents, such that the Government may enjoy the intended access, occupancy, possession, and use of the entire work without impairment due to incomplete or deficient work, and without interference from the Contractor's completion of remaining work or correction of deficiencies in completed work.
                (3) In no event shall the work be deemed “substantially complete” if all fire and life safety systems are not tested and accepted by the authority having jurisdiction, where such acceptance is required under the contract.
                (4) Unless otherwise specifically noted, or otherwise clear from context, all references in the contract to “acceptance” shall refer to issuance of a written determination of substantial completion by the Contracting Officer.
                (b) Notice of Substantial Completion. (1) With reasonable advance notice, the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written proposal recommending a substantial completion date.
                (2) If the Contracting Officer takes exception to the notice of substantial completion, the Contractor shall be entitled to a written notice of conditions precluding determination of substantial completion. The Contractor shall only be entitled to an extension of time to address such conditions if, and to the extent that, the Contracting Officer provides notice of such conditions more than 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of substantial completion.
                (c) Acceptance of Substantial Completion. (1) The Contracting Officer shall conduct inspections and make a determination of substantial completion within a reasonable time.
                (2) Substantial Completion shall be established by the Contracting Officer's issuance of a written determination specifying the date upon which the work is substantially complete.
                (d) Contract Completion. (1) The Contract is complete if and only if the Contractor has completed all work and related contract obligations, corrected all deficiencies and all punch list items, and complied with all conditions for final payment.

                (2) The Contractor shall not be entitled to final payment or release of any retainage held by the Government until after contract completion. If the Contractor does not achieve contract completion within the time required by this contract, the Government shall be entitled, after providing notice to the Contractor, to complete any work remaining unfinished. The Contractor shall be liable to the Government for all costs incurred by the Government to complete such work.

A listing of countries participating in the IPPC is found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/plant_exports/wpm/country/index.shtml.
                
                
                  Non-manufactured wood, is also called solid wood and defined as wood packing other than that comprised wholly of wood-based products such as plywood, particle board, oriented strand board, veneer, wood wool, and similar materials, which has been created using glue, heat and pressure or a combination thereof.
                
                  Packaged material, and solid wood packing material (SWPM), for purposes of this clause, is defined as each separate and distinct material that by itself or in combination with other materials forms the container providing a means of protecting and handling a product. This includes, but is not limited to, pallets, dunnage, crating, packing blocks, drums, load boards, pallet collars, and skids.
                (b) Non-manufactured wood pallets and other non-manufactured wood packaging material used to pack items for delivery to or through IPPC countries must be marked and properly treated in accordance with IPPC guidelines.
                (c) This requirement applies whether the shipment is direct to the end user or through a Government designated consolidation point. Packaging that does not conform to IPPC guidelines will be refused entry, destroyed or treated prior to entry.

                (d) For Department of Defense distribution facilities or freight consolidation points, all non-manufactured wood pallets or packaging material with a probability of entering countries endorsing the IPPC Guidelines must be treated and marked in accordance with DLAD 47.305-1 (available at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/archive/Dlad/Rev5/PART47.htm”), and MIL-STD-2073-1, Standard Practice for Military Packaging (and any future revision).
                (e) Pallets and packing material shipped to FAS distribution facilities designated for possible delivery to the countries endorsing the IPPC Guidelines will comply with DLAD 47.305-1, and MIL-STD-2073-1.
                (f) Delays in delivery caused by non-complying pallets or wood package material will not be considered as beyond the control of the Contractor. Any applicable Government expense incurred as a result of the Contractor's failure to provide appropriate pallets or package material shall be reimbursed by the Contractor. Expenses may include the applicable cost for repackaging, handling and return shipping, or the destruction of solid wood packaging material.

                (i) The 10th day after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 10th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice; provided the Contractor submitted a proper invoice and no disagreement exists over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
                (ii) The 10th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed by the Contractor.
                (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:
                (1) The schedule of supplies/services.
                (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, Unauthorized Obligations, and Commercial Supplier Agreements-Unenforceable Clauses paragraphs of this clause.
                (3) The clause at 52.212-5.
                (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any commercial supplier agreements as amended by the Commercial Supplier Agreements—Unenforceable Clauses provision.
                (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
                (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
                (7) The Standard Form 1449.
                (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
                (9) The specification.
                (u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any commercial supplier agreement (as defined in 502.101) that includes any language, provision, or clause requiring the Government to pay any future fees, penalties, interest, legal costs or to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
                (i) Any such language, provision, or clause is unenforceable against the Government.
                (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the commercial supplier agreement. If the commercial supplier agreement is invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
                (iii) Any such language, provision, or clause is deemed to be stricken from the commercial supplier agreement.
                (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification or any other payment by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
                (w) Commercial supplier agreements—unenforceable clauses. When any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to a commercial supplier agreement (as defined in 502.101), the following language shall be deemed incorporated into the commercial supplier agreement. As used herein, “this agreement” means the commercial supplier agreement:
                (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, when the end user is an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, the following shall apply:
                (i) Applicability. This agreement is a part of a contract between the commercial supplier and the U.S. Government for the acquisition of the supply or service that necessitates a license or other similar legal instrument (including all contracts, task orders, and delivery orders under FAR Part 12).
                (ii) End user. This agreement shall bind the ordering activity as end user but shall not operate to bind a Government employee or person acting on behalf of the Government in his or her personal capacity.
                (iii) Law and disputes. This agreement is governed by Federal law.
                (A) Any language purporting to subject the U.S. Government to the laws of a U.S. state, U.S. territory, district, or municipality, or a foreign nation, except where Federal law expressly provides for the application of such laws, is hereby deleted.
                (B) Any language requiring dispute resolution in a specific forum or venue that is different from that prescribed by applicable Federal law is hereby deleted.
                (C) Any language prescribing a different time period for bringing an action than that prescribed by applicable Federal law in relation to a dispute is hereby deleted.
                (iv) Continued performance. The supplier or licensor shall not unilaterally revoke, terminate or suspend any rights granted to the Government except as allowed by this contract. If the supplier or licensor believes the ordering activity to be in breach of the agreement, it shall pursue its rights under the Contract Disputes Act or other applicable Federal statute while continuing performance as set forth in subparagraph (d) (Disputes).
                (v) Arbitration; equitable or injunctive relief. In the event of a claim or dispute arising under or relating to this agreement, a binding arbitration shall not be used unless specifically authorized by agency guidance, and equitable or injunctive relief, including the award of attorney fees, costs or interest, may be awarded against the U.S. Government only when explicitly provided by statute (e.g., Prompt Payment Act or Equal Access to Justice Act).
                (vi) Updating terms. (A) After award, the contractor may unilaterally revise terms if they are not material. A material change is defined as:
                (1) Terms that change Government rights or obligations;
                (2) Terms that increase Government prices;
                (3) Terms that decrease overall level of service; or
                (4) Terms that limit any other Government right addressed elsewhere in this contract.
                (B) For revisions that will materially change the terms of the contract, the revised commercial supplier agreement must be incorporated into the contract using a bilateral modification.
                (C) Any agreement terms or conditions unilaterally revised subsequent to award that are inconsistent with any material term or provision of this contract shall not be enforceable against the Government, and the Government shall not be deemed to have consented to them.
                (vii) No automatic renewals. If any license or service tied to periodic payment is provided under this agreement (e.g., annual software maintenance or annual lease term), such license or service shall not renew automatically upon expiration of its current term without prior express consent by an authorized Government representative.
                (viii) Indemnification. Any clause of this agreement requiring the commercial supplier or licensor to defend or indemnify the end user is hereby amended to provide that the U.S. Department of Justice has the sole right to represent the United States in any such action, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 516.
                (ix) Audits. Any clause of this agreement permitting the commercial supplier or licensor to audit the end user's compliance with this agreement is hereby amended as follows:
                (A) Discrepancies found in an audit may result in a charge by the commercial supplier or licensor to the ordering activity. Any resulting invoice must comply with the proper invoicing requirements specified in the underlying Government contract or order.
                (B) This charge, if disputed by the ordering activity, will be resolved in accordance with subparagraph (d) (Disputes); no payment obligation shall arise on the part of the ordering activity until the conclusion of the dispute process.
                (C) Any audit requested by the contractor will be performed at the contractor's expense, without reimbursement by the Government.
                (x) Taxes or surcharges. Any taxes or surcharges which the commercial supplier or licensor seeks to pass along to the Government as end user will be governed by the terms of the underlying Government contract or order and, in any event, must be submitted to the Contracting Officer for a determination of applicability prior to invoicing unless specifically agreed to otherwise in the Government contract.
                (xi) Non-assignment. This agreement may not be assigned, nor may any rights or obligations thereunder be delegated, without the Government's prior approval, except as expressly permitted under subparagraph (b) of this clause.
                (xii) Confidential information. If this agreement includes a confidentiality clause, such clause is hereby amended to state that neither the agreement nor the contract price list, as applicable, shall be deemed “confidential information.” Issues regarding release of “unit pricing” will be resolved consistent with the Freedom of Information Act. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the Government may retain any confidential information as required by law, regulation or its internal document retention procedures for legal, regulatory or compliance purposes; provided, however, that all such retained confidential information will continue to be subject to the confidentiality obligations of this agreement.
                
                (2) If any language, provision, or clause of this agreement conflicts or is inconsistent with the preceding paragraph (w)(1), the language, provisions, or clause of paragraph (w)(1) shall prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.

                (a) The Government, at its election, may reduce the price of this contract or contract modification if the Contracting Officer determines after award of this contract or contract modification that the price negotiated was increased by a significant amount because the Contractor failed to:

                (c) If any reduction in the contract price under this clause reduces the price for items for which payment was made prior to the date of the modification reflecting the price reduction, the Contractor shall be liable to and shall pay the United States—
                (1) The amount of the overpayment; and
                (2) Simple interest on the amount of such overpayment to be computed from the date(s) of overpayment to the Contractor to the date the Government is repaid by the Contractor at the applicable underpayment rate effective each quarter prescribed by the Secretary of Treasury under 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2).
                (d) Failure to agree on the amount of the decrease shall be resolved as a dispute.

                (a) “Producer Price Index” (PPI), as used in this clause, means the originally released index, not seasonally adjusted, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (Labor) for product code ____ found under Table ____.
                (b) During the term of the contract, the award price may be adjusted once during each 12-month period upward or downward. However, if an upward adjustment, a maximum of ___*___ percent shall apply. Any price adjustment for the product code shall be based upon the percentage change in the PPI released in the month prior to the initial month of the contract period specified in the solicitation for sealed bidding or the month prior to award in negotiation (the base index) and the PPI released 12 months later (the updated index). The formula for determining the Adjusted Contract Price (ACP) applicable to shipments for the balance of the contract period is—
                
                  ER09JY99.000
                
                (c) If the PPI is not available for the month of the base index or the updated index, the month with the most recently published PPI prior to the month determining the base index or updated index shall be used.
                (d) If a product code is discontinued, the Government and the Contractor will mutually agree to substitute a similar product code. If Labor designates an index with a new title and/or code number as continuous with the product code specified above, the new index shall be used.
                (e) Unless the Contractor's written request for a price adjustment resulting from the application of the formula in (b) above is received by the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days of the release of the updated index, the Contractor shall have waived its right to an upward price adjustment for the balance of the contract. Alternatively, the Contracting Officer will unilaterally adjust the award price downward when appropriate using the updated index defined in (b) above.
                (f) Price adjustments shall be effective upon execution of a contract modification by the Government or on the 31st day following the release of the updated index, whichever is later, shall indicate the updated index and percent of change as well as the ACP, and shall not apply to delivery orders issued before the effective date.

This initial contract period may be less than 12 months. The formula for determining the Adjusted Contract Price (ACP) applicable to shipments during the first option period is—

                (2) For any subsequent option period, the price adjustment shall be the percentage change between the previously updated index (the new base index) and the PPI released 12 months later (the most recent updated index). This percentage shall be applied to the Current Contract Price (CCP). The formula for determining the ACP applicable to shipments for the subsequent option period(s) is—
                
                  ER09JY99.002

Alternatively, the Contracting Officer in its written notice shall exercise the option at the CCP or at a reduced price when appropriate using the formulas in (b) (1) or (2) above.
                (f) Price adjustments shall be effected by execution of a contract modification by the Government indicating the most recent updated index and percent of change and shall apply to delivery orders placed on or after the first day of the option period.

                Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman (JAN 2017)

                (a) GSA has designated a Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman who will review complaints from contractors and ensure that they are afforded a fair opportunity for consideration in the award of task or delivery orders under Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, consistent with the procedures in the contract. Written complaints shall be submitted to the Ombudsman, with a copy to the Contracting Officer.

                Transactional Data Reporting (JUN 2016)
                (a) Definition. Transactional data encompasses the historical details of the products or services delivered by the Contractor during the performance of task or delivery orders issued against this contract.
                (b) Reporting of Transactional Data. The Contractor must report all transactional data under this contract as follows:

                (1) The Contractor must electronically report transactional data by utilizing the automated reporting system at an Internet Web site designated by the General Services Administration (GSA) or by uploading the data according to GSA instructions. GSA will post registration instructions and reporting procedures on the Vendor Support Center Web site, https://vsc.gsa.gov. The reporting system Web site address, as well as registration instructions and reporting procedures, will be provided at the time of award or inclusion of this clause in the contract.
                (2) The Contractor must provide, at no additional cost to the Government, the following transactional data elements, as applicable:
                (i) Contract or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) Number.
                (ii) Delivery/Task Order Number/Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID).
                (iii) Non Federal Entity.
                (iv) Description of Deliverable.
                (v) Manufacturer Name.
                (vi) Manufacturer Part Number.
                (vii) Unit Measure (each, hour, case, lot).
                (viii) Quantity of Item Sold.
                (ix) Universal Product Code.
                (x) Price Paid per Unit.
                (xi) Total Price.
                
                
                  Note to paragraph (b)(2):
                  The Contracting Officer may add data elements to the standard elements listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section with the approvals listed in GSAM 507.105(c)(3).
                
                
                (3) The Contractor must report transactional data within 30 calendar days from the last calendar day of the month. If there was no contract activity during the month, the Contractor must submit a confirmation of no reportable transactional data within 30 calendar days of the last calendar day of the month.
                (4) The Contractor must report the price paid per unit, total price, or any other data elements with an associated monetary value listed in (b)(2) of this section, in U.S. dollars.
                (5) The Contractor must maintain a consistent accounting method of transactional data reporting, based on the Contractor's established commercial accounting practice.
                (6) Reporting Points. (i) The acceptable points at which transactional data may be reported include—
                (A) Issuance of an invoice; or
                (B) Receipt of payment.
                (ii) The Contractor must determine whether to report transactional data on the basis of invoices issued or payments received.
                (7) The Contractor must continue to furnish reports, including confirmation of no transactional data, through physical completion of the last outstanding task or delivery order issued against the contract.
                (8) Unless otherwise expressly stated by the ordering activity, orders that contain classified information or other information that would compromise national security are exempt from this reporting requirement.
                (9) This clause does not exempt the Contractor from fulfilling existing reporting requirements contained elsewhere in the contract.
                (10) GSA reserves the unilateral right to change reporting instructions following 60 calendar days' advance notification to the Contractor.
                (c) Contract Access Fee (CAF). (1) GSA's operating costs are reimbursed through a CAF charged on orders placed against this contract. The CAF is paid by the ordering activity but remitted to GSA by the Contractor. GSA has the unilateral right to change the fee structure at any time, but not more than once per year; GSA will provide reasonable notice prior to the effective date of any change.

                (2) Within 60 calendar days of award or inclusion of this clause in the contract, a GSA representative will provide the Contractor with specific written procedural instructions on remitting the CAF, including the deadline by which the Contractor must remit the CAF. The deadline specified in the written procedural instructions will be no less than 30 calendar days after the last calendar day of the month. GSA reserves the unilateral right to change remittance instructions following 60 calendar days' advance notification to the Contractor.
                (3) The Contractor must remit the CAF to GSA in U.S. dollars.
                (4) The Contractor's failure to remit the full amount of the CAF within the specified deadline constitutes a contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR Subpart 32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or offsetting payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17, Interest). If the Contractor fails to submit the required sales reports, falsifies them, or fails to timely pay the CAF, these reasons constitute sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for cause.

                Ordering Agency Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman (JAN 2017)
                (a) Ordering Agency Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman. The Ordering Agency shall designate a Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman to review complaints from contractors and ensure that they are afforded a fair opportunity for consideration in the award of task or delivery orders placed against GSA Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, consistent with the procedures in the contract. The contact information for the Ordering Agency Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman shall be made available to contractors.
                (b) Submission of Complaints. When a contractor submits a complaint to the Ordering Agency's designated Task-Order and Delivery-Order Ombudsman, the contractor shall also send a copy of the complaint to the GSA Procurement Ombudsman, for informational purposes. The GSA Procurement Ombudsman is located at the General Services Administration, Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP), Office of Acquisition Policy (MV). Contact information for the GSA Procurement Ombudsman can be found at: http://www.gsa.gov/ombudsman.

                Evaluation of Options (JUL 2016)
                (a) The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by determining the lowest base period price. When option year pricing is based on a formula (e.g., changes in the Producer Price Index or other common standard), option year pricing is automatically considered when evaluating the base year price, as any change in price will be uniformly related to changes in market conditions. All options are therefore considered to be evaluated. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
                (b) The Government will reject the offer if exceptions are taken to the price provisions of the Economic Price Adjustment clause, unless the exception results in a lower maximum option year price. Such offers will be evaluated without regard to the lower option year(s) maximum. However, if the offeror offering a lower maximum is awarded a contract, the award will reflect the lower maximum.

In no case will this division vary by more than a 60/40 division (with either the non-set-aside or set-aside Contractor receiving the larger portion) from the time of the award of the set-aside portion.

                FAR 52.232-5, Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, is supplemented as follows:
                (a) Before submitting a request for payment, the Contractor shall, unless directed otherwise by the Contracting Officer, attend pre-invoice payment meetings, as scheduled, with the designated Government representative for the purpose of facilitating review and approval of payment requests.

                In order to prevent confusion and delay in making payment, the Contractor shall not assign any claim(s) for amounts due or to become due under this contract.

Any such assignment takes effect only if and when the assignee files written notice of the assignment together with a true copy of the instrument of assignment with the contracting officer issuing the order and the finance office designated in the order to make payment. Unless otherwise stated in the order, payments to an assignee of any amounts due or to become due under any order assigned may, to the extent specified in the Act, be subject to reduction or set-off.

                Prompt Payment (NOV 2009) (Deviation FAR 52.232-25)
                Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments and contract financing payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. Payment shall be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer. Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in section 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified. (However, see subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)
                (a) Invoice payments. (1) The due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office is:
                (i) For orders placed electronically by the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), and to be paid by GSA through electronic funds transfer (EFT), the later of the following two events:
                (A) The 10th day after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 10th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice; provided the Contractor submitted a proper invoice and no disagreement exists over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
                (B) The 10th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed by the Contractor.
                (ii) For all other orders, the later of the following two events:
                (A) The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be the 30th day after the date ofthe Contractor's invoice; provided the Contractor submitted a proper invoice and no disagreement exists over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
                (B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed by the Contractor.
                (iii) On a final invoice, if the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance occurs on the effective date of the contract settlement.
                (2) The General Services Administration will issue payment on the due date in (a)(1)(i) above if the Contractor complies with full cycle electronic commerce. Full cycle electronic commerce includes all the following elements:
                (i) The Contractor must receive and fulfill electronic data interchange (EDI) purchase orders (transaction set 850).
                (ii) The Contractor must generate and submit to the Government valid EDI invoices (transaction set 810) or submit invoices through the GSA Finance Center Internet-based invoice process. Internet-based invoices must be submitted using procedures provided by GSA.
                (iii) The Contractor's financial institution must receive and process, on behalf of the Contractor, EFT payments through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system.
                (iv) The EDI transaction sets in (i) through (iii) above must adhere to implementation conventions provided by GSA.
                (3) If any of the conditions in(a)(2) above do not occur, the 10 day payment due dates in (a)(1) become 30 day payment due dates.
                (4) Certain food products and other payments. (i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are—
                (A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182 (3)), and as further defined in Pub. L. 98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, an any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.
                (B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.
                (C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract.

                (D) For daily products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the Contractor making the representation.
                (ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract.
                (5) Contractor's invoice. The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (g) of the clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, if the Contractor submits hard-copy invoices, submit only an original invoice. No copies of the invoice are required. A proper invoice must include the items listed in subdivisions (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(viii) of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, it shall be returned within 7 days after the date the designated billing office received the invoice (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with a statement of the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. Untimely notification will be taken into account in computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor in the manner described in subparagraph (a)(5) of this clause.
                (i) Name and address of the Contractor.
                (ii) Invoice date. (The Contractor is encouraged to date invoices as close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)
                (iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services preformed (including order number and contract line item number).
                (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, an extended prices of supplies delivered or services performed.
                (v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment, prompt payment discount terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills or lading.
                (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).
                (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.
                (viii) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (such as evidence of shipment).
                (ix) While not required, the Contractor is strongly encouraged to assign an identification number to each invoice.
                (6) Interest penalty. An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(6)(i) through (a)(6)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.
                (i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.
                (ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.
                (iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.
                (7) Computing penalty amount. The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty is prescribed by other governmental authority (e.g., tariffs). This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and it is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice principal payment amount approved by the Government until the payment date of such approved principal amount; and will be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice principal payment amount and will be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(5) of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest penalty owed the Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest penalties.
                (i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivered the supplies or performed the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does, not however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.
                (ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the determination of an interest penalty:
                (A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils).
                (B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor.
                (C) For incorrect electronic funds transfer (EFT) information, in accordance with the EFT clause of this contract.
                (iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid.
                (iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes.
                (8) Prompt payment discounts. An interest penalty also shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated as described in subparagraph (a)(7) of this clause on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when the Contractor is paid.
                (9) Additional interest penalty. (i) If this contract was awarded on or October 1, 1989, a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with subdivision (a)(9)(iii) of this clause, shall be paid in addition to the interest penalty amount if the Contractor—
                (A) Is owed an interest penalty of $1 or more;
                (B) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and
                (C) Makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with subdivision (a)(9)(ii) of this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid.
                (ii)(A) Contractors shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. No additional data shall be required. Contractors shall—
                (1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;
                (2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest was due; and
                (3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.
                (B) Demands must be postmarked on or before the 40th day after payment was made, except that—
                (1) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent, the demand must have been received and annotated with the date of receipt by the designated payment office on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or
                (2) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent and the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the demand's validity will be determined by the date the Contractor has placed on the demand; provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.
                (iii)(A) The additional penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of any original late payment interest penalty, except—
                (1) The additional penalty shall not exceed $5,000;
                (2) The additional penalty shall never be less than $25; and
                (3) No additional penalty is owed if the amount of the underlying interest penalty is less than $1.
                (B) If the interest penalty ceases to accrue in accordance with the limits stated in subdivision (a)(5)(iii) of this clause, the amount of the additional penalty shall be calculated on the amount of interest penalty that would have accrued in the absence of these limits, subject to the overall limits on the additional penalty specified in subdivision (a)(7)(iii)(A) of this clause.

                (C) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, the test shall be the interest penalty due on each separate payment made for each separate contract. The maximum and minimum additional penalty shall not be based upon individual invoices unless the invoices are paid separately. Where payments are consolidated for disbursing purposes, the maximum and minimum additional penalty determination shall be made separately for each contract therein.
                (D) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).
                (b) Contract financing payments—(1) Due dates for recurring financing payments. If this contract provides for contract financing, requests for payment shall be submitted to the designated billing office as specified in this contract or as directed by the Contracting Officer. Contract financing payments shall be made on the [insert day as prescribed by Agency head; if not prescribed, insert 30th day] day after receipt of a proper contract financing request by the designated billing office. In the event that an audit or other review of a specific financing request is required to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the due date specified.
                (2) Due dates for other contract financing. For advance payments, loans, or other arrangements that do not involve recurring submissions of contract financing requests, payment shall be in accordance with the corresponding contract terms or as directed by the Contracting Officer.
                (3) Interest penalty not applicable. Contract financing payments shall not be assessed an interest penalty for payment delays.
                (c) Fast payment procedure due dates. If this contract contains the clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.

                (a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any commercial supplier agreement (as defined in 502.101) that includes any language, provision, or clause requiring the Government to pay any future fees, penalties, interest, legal costs or to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
                (1) Any such language, provision, or clause is unenforceable against the Government.
                (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such language, provision, or clause by virtue of it appearing in the commercial supplier agreement. If the commercial supplier agreement is invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
                (3) Any such language, provision, or clause is deemed to be stricken from the commercial supplier agreement.
                (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification or any other payment by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

                (c) The Contractor shall not process a transaction for payment using the charge card until the purchased supplies have been shipped or services performed. Unless the cardholder requests correction or replacement of a defective or faulty item under other contract requirements, the Contractor must immediately credit a cardholder's account for items returned as defective or faulty.
                (d) Payments made using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card are not eligible for any negotiated prompt payment discount. Payment made using a Government debit card will receive the applicable prompt payment discount.

              Commercial Supplier Agreements—Unenforceable Clauses.
              As prescribed in 513.302-5 and 532.706-3 insert the following clause:
              
                Commercial Supplier Agreements-Unenforceable Clauses (FEB. 2018)
                When any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to a commercial supplier agreement (as defined in 502.101), the following language shall be deemed incorporated into the commercial supplier agreement. As used herein, “this agreement” means the commercial supplier agreement:
                (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, when the end user is an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, the following shall apply:
                (1) Applicability. This agreement is part of a contract between the commercial supplier and the U.S. Government for the acquisition of the supply or service that necessitates a license or other similar legal instrument (including all contracts, task orders, and delivery orders under FAR Parts 13, 14 or 15).
                (2) End user. This agreement shall bind the ordering activity as end user but shall not operate to bind a Government employee or person acting on behalf of the Government in his or her personal capacity.
                (3) Law and disputes. This agreement is governed by Federal law.
                (i) Any language purporting to subject the U.S. Government to the laws of a U.S. state, U.S. territory, district, or municipality, or foreign nation, except where Federal law expressly provides for the application of such laws, is hereby deleted.
                (ii) Any language requiring dispute resolution in a specific forum or venue that is different from that prescribed by applicable Federal law is hereby deleted.
                (iii) Any language prescribing a different time period for bringing an action than that prescribed by applicable Federal law in relation to a dispute is hereby deleted.
                (4) Continued performance. The supplier or licensor shall not unilaterally revoke, terminate or suspend any rights granted to the Government except as allowed by this contract. If the supplier or licensor believes the ordering activity to be in breach of the agreement, it shall pursue its rights under the Contract Disputes Act or other applicable Federal statute while continuing performance as set forth in FAR 52.233-1, Disputes.
                (5) Arbitration; equitable or injunctive relief. In the event of a claim or dispute arising under or relating to this agreement, a binding arbitration shall not be used unless specifically authorized by agency guidance, and equitable or injunctive relief, including the award of attorney fees, costs or interest, may be awarded against the U.S. Government only when explicitly provided by statute (e.g., Prompt Payment Act or Equal Access to Justice Act).
                (6) Updating terms. (i) After award, the contractor may unilaterally revise terms if they are not material. A material change is defined as:
                (A) Terms that significantly change Government rights or obligations; and
                (B) Terms that increase Government prices;
                (C) Terms that decrease overall level of service; or
                (D) Terms that limit any other Government right addressed elsewhere in this contract.
                (ii) For revisions that will materially change the terms of the contract, the revised commercial supplier agreement must be incorporated into the contract using a bilateral modification.

                (iii) Any agreement terms or conditions unilaterally revised subsequent to award that are inconsistent with any material term or provision of this contract shall not be enforceable against the Government, and the Government shall not be deemed to have consented to them.
                (7) No automatic renewals. If any license or service tied to periodic payment is provided under this agreement (e.g., annual software maintenance or annual lease term), such license or service shall not renew automatically upon expiration of its current term without prior express consent by an authorized Government representative.
                (8) Indemnification. Any clause of this agreement requiring the commercial supplier or licensor to defend or indemnify the end user is hereby amended to provide that the U.S. Department of Justice has the sole right to represent the United States in any such action, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 516.
                (9) Audits. Any clause of this agreement permitting the commercial supplier or licensor to audit the end user's compliance with this agreement is hereby amended as follows:
                (i) Discrepancies found in an audit may result in a charge by the commercial supplier or licensor to the ordering activity. Any resulting invoice must comply with the proper invoicing requirements specified in the underlying Government contract or order.
                (ii) This charge, if disputed by the ordering activity, will be resolved through the Disputes clause at FAR 52.233-1; no payment obligation shall arise on the part of the ordering activity until the conclusion of the dispute process.
                (iii) Any audit requested by the contractor will be performed at the contractor's expense, without reimbursement by the Government.
                (10) Taxes or surcharges. Any taxes or surcharges which the commercial supplier or licensor seeks to pass along to the Government as end user will be governed by the terms of the underlying Government contract or order and, in any event, must be submitted to the Contracting Officer for a determination of applicability prior to invoicing unless specifically agreed to otherwise in the Government contract.
                (11) Non-assignment. This agreement may not be assigned, nor may any rights or obligations thereunder be delegated, without the Government's prior approval, except as expressly permitted under the clause at FAR 52.232-23, Assignment of Claims.
                (12) Confidential information. If this agreement includes a confidentiality clause, such clause is hereby amended to state that neither the agreement nor the contract price list, as applicable, shall be deemed “confidential information.” Issues regarding release of “unit pricing” will be resolved consistent with the Freedom of Information Act. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the Government may retain any confidential information as required by law, regulation or its internal document retention procedures for legal, regulatory or compliance purposes; provided, however, that all such retained confidential information will continue to be subject to the confidentiality obligations of this agreement.
                (b) If any language, provision or clause of this agreement conflicts or is inconsistent with the preceding paragraph (a), the language, provisions, or clause of paragraph (a) shall prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.

The Contractor shall designate a principal of the firm or other senior management official to provide executive oversight and problem resolution resources to the project for the life of the contract.
                (b) The Contractor shall employ, and require its subcontractors to employ, qualified personnel to perform the contract. The Government reserves the right to exclude, or remove from the site or building, any personnel for reasons of incompetence, carelessness, or insubordination, who violate rules and regulations concerning conduct on federal property, or whose continued employment on the site is otherwise deemed by the Government to be contrary to the public interest.
                (c) The Contractor shall be responsible for coordinating all activities of subcontractors, including all of the following activities:
                (1) Preparation of shop drawings produced by different subcontractors where their work interfaces or may potentially conflict or interfere.
                (2) Scheduling of work by subcontractors.
                (3) Installation of work by subcontractors.

              Schedules for Construction Contracts (Mar 2019)
              
                The requirements, of the clause entitled “Schedules for Construction Contracts” at FAR 52.236-15, are supplemented as follows:
                (a) Purpose. The project schedule shall be a rational, reasonable, and realistic plan for completing the work, and conform to the requirements specified in this clause and elsewhere in the contract. The Contractor understands and acknowledges that the preparation and proper management of the project schedule is a material component of the contract.
                (b) Use of the schedule. The Contracting Officer shall be entitled, but not required, to rely upon the project schedule to evaluate the Contractor's progress, evaluate entitlement to extensions of time, and determine the criticality or float of any activities described in such project schedule.
                (c) Submission. Prior to notice to proceed, or such other time as may be specified in the contract, the Contractor shall submit the project schedule.
                (d) Milestones. The project schedule shall incorporate milestone events specified in the contract, including, as applicable, notice to proceed, substantial completion, and milestones related to specified work phases and site restrictions. The project schedule shall also include Contractor-defined milestones to identify target dates for critical events, based upon the Contractor's chosen sequence of work.
                (e) Activities. The project schedule shall depict all major activities necessary to complete the work.
                (f) Schedule of values. (1) The Contractor shall prepare and submit for approval a cost breakdown of the Contract price, to be referred to as the “schedule of values”, assigning values to each major activity necessary to complete the work.
                (2) Values must include all direct and indirect costs, although a separate value for bond costs may be established.
                (3) The schedule of values must contain sufficient detail to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate applications for payment.
                (g) Conflicting terms. (1) If at any time the Contracting Officer finds that the project schedule does not comply with any contract requirement, the Contracting Officer will provide written notice to the Contractor.
                (2) Within 30 calendar days of written notice, or such other time as may be specified, from the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall take one of the following actions:
                (i) Revise the project schedule.
                (ii) Adjust activity progress.
                (iii) Provide sufficient information demonstrating compliance.
                (3) If the Contractor fails to sufficiently address the Contracting Officer's exceptions to the project schedule, the Contracting Officer may—
                (i) Withhold retainage until the project is substantially complete or until such time as the Contractor has complied with project schedule requirements; or
                (ii) Terminate the contract for default.
                (h) Revisions to the schedule. If the Contractor revises the project schedule after initial approved submission, the Contractor shall provide in writing a narrative describing the substance of the revision, the rationale for the revision, and the impact of the revision on the projected substantial completion date and the available float for all activities. The addition of detail to prospective activities shall not be deemed a revision if the overall duration of the detailed activity does not change.
                (i) Updates. Unless a different period for updates is specified elsewhere, the Contractor shall update the project schedule weekly to reflect actual progress in completing the work, and submit the updated project schedule by the following Monday.
              
              (End of clause)
              
              
                Alternate I (Mar 2019). As prescribed in 536.515(a), substitute the following paragraphs (c), (e), (h), and (i) for paragraphs (c), (e), (h), and (i) of the basic clause:
              
              
                
                (c) Submission. Within 30 calendar days of notice to proceed, or such other time as may be specified in the contract, the Contractor shall submit the project schedule, together with a written narrative describing the major work activities, activities on the critical path, and major constraints underlying the sequence and logic of the project schedule.
                (e) Activities. (1) The Contractor shall use a critical path method project schedule to plan, coordinate, and perform the work.
                (2) The project schedule shall depict all activities necessary to complete the work, including, as applicable, all submittal and submittal review activities, all procurement activities, and all field activities, including mobilization, construction, start-up, testing, balancing, commissioning, and punchlist.
                (3) Activities shall be sufficiently detailed and limited in duration to enable proper planning and coordination of the work, effective evaluation of the reasonableness and realism of the project schedule, accurate monitoring of progress, and reliable analysis of schedule impacts.
                (4) Activity durations shall be based upon reasonable and realistic allocation of the resources required to complete each activity, given physical and logistical constraints on the performance of the work. All logic shall validly reflect physical or logistical constraints on relationships between activities. Except for the first and last activities in the project schedule, each activity shall have at least one predecessor and one successor relationship to form a logically connected network plan from notice to proceed to the contract completion date.
                (h) Revisions to the schedule. (1) The Contractor should anticipate that the initial submittal of the project schedule will be subject to review and may require revision. The Contractor shall devote sufficient resources for meetings, revisions, and resubmissions of the project schedule to address any exceptions taken to the initial submittal. The Contractor understands and acknowledges that the purpose of the initial review and resolution of exceptions is to maximize the usefulness of the project schedule for contract performance.
                (2) If the Contractor revises the project schedule after initial approved submission, the Contractor shall provide in writing a narrative describing the substance of the revision, the rationale for the revision, and the impact of the revision on the projected substantial completion date and the available float for all activities. The addition of detail to prospective activities shall not be deemed a revision if the overall duration of the detailed activity does not change.
                (i) Updates. Unless a different period for updates is specified elsewhere, the Contractor shall update the project schedule monthly to reflect actual progress in completing the work, and submit the updated project schedule within 5 working days of the end of each month.

                (e) Activities. (1) The Contractor shall use a critical path method project schedule to plan, coordinate, and perform the work.
                (2) Activities shall be sufficiently detailed and limited in duration to enable proper planning and coordination of the work, effective evaluation of the reasonableness and realism of the project schedule, accurate monitoring of progress, and reliable analysis of schedule impacts.
                (3) Activity durations shall be based upon reasonable and realistic allocation of the resources required to complete each activity, given physical and logistical constraints on the performance of the work. All logic shall validly reflect physical or logistical constraints on relationships between activities. Except for the first and last activities in the project schedule, each activity shall have at least one predecessor and one successor relationship to form a logically connected network plan from notice to proceed to the contract completion date.
                (i) Updates.

The Contracting Officer alone shall have the power to bind the Government and to exercise the rights, responsibilities, authorities and functions vested in him by the contract documents.

The Contracting Officer may, at any time during the performance of this contract, vest in any such COR additional power and authority to act for him or designate additional CORs, specifying the extent of their authority to act for him. A copy of each document vesting additional authority in a COR or designating an additional COR shall be furnished to the Contractor.
                (b) The Contractor shall perform the contract in accordance with any order (including but not limited to instruction, direction, interpretation, or determination) issued by a COR in accordance with his authority to act for the Contracting Officer; but the Contractor assumes all the risk and consequences of performing the contract in accordance with any order (including but not limited to instruction, direction, interpretation, or determination) of anyone not authorized to issue such order.
                (c) If the Contractor receives written notice from the Contracting Officer of non-compliance with any requirement of this contract, the Contractor must initiate action as may be appropriate to comply with the specified requirement as defined in the notice. In the event the Contractor fails to initiate such action within a reasonable period of time as defined in the notice, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to order the Contractor to stop any or all work under the contract until the Contractor has complied or has initiated such action as may be appropriate to comply within a reasonable period of time. The Contractor will not be entitled to any extension of contract time or payment for any costs incurred as a result of being ordered to stop work for such cause.

                (d) The Contractor shall be responsible for providing professional design services in connection with performance of the work or portions of the work only if this responsibility is expressly stated in the contract, and the contract documents provide the performance and design criteria that such services will be required to satisfy. In the performance of such work, the Contractor shall be responsible for retaining licensed design professionals, who shall sign and seal all drawings, calculations, specifications and other submittals that the licensed professional prepares.

              Identification of Products That Have Environmental Attributes.
              As prescribed in 538.273(d)(2), insert the following clause:
              
                Identification of Products That Have Environmental Attributes (MAY 2019)
                (a) Several laws, Executive orders, and Agency directives require Federal buyers to purchase products that are less harmful to the environment, when they are life cycle cost-effective (see FAR Subpart 23.7). The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) requires contractors to highlight environmental products under Federal Supply Service schedule contracts in various communications media (e.g., publications and electronic formats).
                (b) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                
                  Energy-efficient product means a product that—
                
                (1) Meets Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency criteria for use of the ENERGY STAR® trademark label; or
                (2) Is in the upper 25 percent of efficiency for all similar products as designated by the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program.
                
                  GSA Advantage! is an on-line shopping mall and ordering system that provides customers with access to products and services under GSA contracts.
                
                  Other environmental attributes refers to product characteristics that provide environmental benefits, excluding recovered materials and energy and water efficiency. Several examples of these characteristics are biodegradable, recyclable, reduced pollutants, ozone safe, and low volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
                
                  Post-consumer material means a material or finished product that has served its intended use and has been discarded for disposal or recovery, having completed its life as a consumer item. Post-consumer material is part of the broader category of “recovered material.” The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a list of EPA-designated products in their Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs) to provide Federal agencies with purchasing recommendations on specific products in a Recovered Materials Advisory Notice (RMAN). The RMAN contains recommended recovered and post-consumer material content levels for the specific products designated by EPA (40 CFR part 247 and http://www.epa.gov/cpg/).
                
                  Recovered materials means waste materials and by-products recovered or diverted from solid waste, but the term does not include those materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process (Executive Order 13101 and 42 U.S.C. 6903(19) and http://www.epa.gov/cpg/). For paper and paper products, see the definition at FAR 11.301 (42 U.S.C. 6962(h)).
                
                  Remanufactured means factory rebuilt to original specifications.
                
                  Renewable energy means energy produced by solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass power.
                
                  Renewable energy technology means—
                (1) Technologies that use renewable energy to provide light, heat, cooling, or mechanical or electrical energy for use in facilities or other activities; or
                (2) The use of integrated whole-building designs that rely upon renewable energy resources, including passive solar design.
                (c) Identification requirements. (1) The offeror must identify products that—

                (i) Are compliant with the recovered and post-consumer material content levels recommended in the Recovered Materials Advisory Notices (RMANs) for EPA-designated products in the CPG program (http://www.epa.gov/cpg/);

                (ii) Contain recovered materials that either do not meet the recommended levels in the RMANs or are not EPA-designated products in the CPG program (see FAR 23.401 and http://www.epa.gov/cpg/);

                (iii) Are energy-efficient, as defined by either ENERGY STAR® and/or FEMP's designated top 25th percentile levels (see ENERGY STAR® at http://www.energystar.gov/ and FEMP at http://www.eere.energy.gov/femp/procurement/);
                (iv) Are water-efficient;
                (v) Use renewable energy technology;
                (vi) Are remanufactured; and
                (vii) Have other environmental attributes.
                (2) These identifications must be made in each of the offeror's following mediums:
                (i) The offer itself.
                (ii) Printed commercial catalogs, brochures, and pricelists.
                (iii) Online product website.
                (iv) Electronic data submission for GSA Advantage! submitted via GSA's Schedules Input Program (SIP) software or the Electronic Data Inter-change (EDI). Offerors can use the SIP or EDI methods to indicate environmental and other attributes for each product that are translated into respective icons in GSA Advantage!.
                (d) An offeror, in identifying an item with an environmental attribute, must possess evidence or rely on a reasonable basis to substantiate the claim (see 16 CFR part 260, Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims). The Government will accept an offeror's claim of an item's environmental attribute on the basis of—
                (1) Participation in a Federal agency sponsored program (e.g., the EPA and DOE ENERGY STAR® product labeling program);
                (2) Verification by an independent organization that specializes in certifying such claims; or
                (3) Possession of competent and reliable evidence. For any test, analysis, research, study, or other evidence to be “competent and reliable,” it must have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.

                Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting (MAY 2019)
                (a) Reporting of Federal Supply Schedule Sales. The Contractor shall report all contract sales under this contract as follows:
                (1) The Contractor shall accurately report the dollar value, in U.S. dollars and rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of all sales under this contract by calendar quarter (January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31). The dollar value of a sale is the price paid by the Schedule user for products and services on a Schedule task or delivery order. The reported contract sales value shall include the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). The Contractor shall maintain a consistent accounting method of sales reporting, based on the Contractor's established commercial accounting practice. The acceptable points at which sales may be reported include—
                (i) Receipt of order;
                (ii) Shipment or delivery, as applicable;
                (iii) Issuance of an invoice; or
                (iv) Payment.
                (2) Contract sales shall be reported to Federal Acquisition Services (FAS) within 30 calendar days following the completion of each reporting quarter. The Contractor shall continue to furnish quarterly reports, including “zero” sales, through physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract.
                (3) Reportable sales under the contract are those resulting from sales of contract items to authorized users unless the purchase was conducted pursuant to a separate contracting authority such as a Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC); a separately awarded FAR Part 12, FAR Part 13, FAR Part 14, or FAR Part 15 procurement; or a non-FAR contract. Sales made to state and local governments under Cooperative Purchasing authority shall be counted as reportable sales for IFF purposes.
                (4) The Contractor shall electronically report the quarterly dollar value of sales, including “zero” sales, by utilizing the automated reporting system at an internet website designated by the General Services Administration (GSA)'s Federal Acquisition Service (FAS). Prior to using this automated system, the Contractor shall complete contract registration with the FAS Vendor Support Center (VSC). The website address, as well as registration instructions and reporting procedures, will be provided at the time of award. The Contractor shall report sales separately for each National Stock Number (NSN), Special Item Number (SIN), or sub-item.

                (5) The Contractor shall convert the total value of sales made in foreign currency to U.S. dollars using the “Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange” issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Financial Management Service. The Contractor shall use the issue of the Treasury report in effect on the last day of the calendar quarter. The report is available from Financial Management Service, International Funds Branch, Telephone: (202) 874-7994, internet: http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/treasRptRateExch/treasRptRateExch_home.htm.
                
                (b) The Contractor shall remit the IFF at the rate set by GSA's FAS.
                (1) The Contractor shall remit the IFF to FAS in U.S. dollars within 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting quarter; final payment shall be remitted within 30 days after physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract.

                (2) The IFF represents a percentage of the total quarterly sales reported. This percentage is set at the discretion of GSA's FAS. GSA's FAS has the unilateral right to change the percentage at any time, but not more than once per year. FAS will provide reasonable notice prior to the effective date of the change. The IFF reimburses FAS for the costs of operating the Federal Supply Schedules Program. FAS recoups its operating costs from ordering activities as set forth in 40 U.S.C. 321: Acquisition Services Fund. Net operating revenues generated by the IFF are also applied to fund initiatives benefitting other authorized FAS programs, in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 321. Offerors must include the IFF in their prices. The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities. FAS will post notice of the current IFF at https://72a.gsa.gov/ or successor website as appropriate.
                (c) Within 60 days of award, an FAS representative will provide the Contractor with specific written procedural instructions on remitting the IFF. FAS reserves the unilateral right to change such instructions from time to time, following notification to the Contractor.

                (d) Failure to remit the full amount of the IFF within 30 calendar days after the end of the applicable reporting period constitutes a contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR Subpart 32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or setting off payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17, Interest). Should the Contractor fail to submit the required sales reports, falsify them, or fail to timely pay the IFF, this is sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for cause.

                Alternate I (MAY 2019). As prescribed in 538.273(d)(4), substitute the following paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) for paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the basic clause:
              
              
                (a) Definition. “Transactional data” encompasses the historical details of the products or services delivered by the Contractor during the performance of task or delivery orders issued against this contract.
                (b) Reporting of Transactional Data. The Contractor must report all transactional data under this contract as follows:

                (1) The Contractor must electronically report transactional data by utilizing the automated reporting system at an internet website designated by the General Services Administration (GSA) or by uploading the data according to GSA instructions. GSA will post registration instructions and reporting procedures on the Vendor Support Center website, https://vsc.gsa.gov. The reporting system website address, as well as registration instructions and reporting procedures, will be provided at the time of award or inclusion of this clause in the contract.
                (2) The Contractor must provide, at no additional cost to the Government, the following transactional data elements, as applicable:
                (i) Contract or Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) Number.
                (ii) Delivery/Task Order Number/Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID).
                (iii) Non Federal Entity.
                (iv) Description of Deliverable.
                (v) Manufacturer Name.
                (vi) Manufacturer Part Number.
                (vii) Unit Measure (each, hour, case, lot).
                (viii) Quantity of Item Sold.
                (ix) Universal Product Code.
                (x) Price Paid per Unit.
                (xi) Total Price.
                
                
                  Note to paragraph (b)(2):
                  The Contracting Officer may add data elements to the standard elements listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section with the approvals listed in GSAM 507.105(c)(3).
                
                
                (3) The contractor must report transactional data within 30 calendar days from the last calendar day of the month. If there was no contract activity during the month, the Contractor must submit a confirmation of no reportable transactional data within 30 calendar days of the last calendar day of the month.
                (4) The Contractor must report the price paid per unit, total price, or any other data elements with an associated monetary value listed in (b)(2) of this section, in U.S. dollars.
                (5) The reported price paid per unit and total price must include the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF).
                (6) The Contractor must maintain a consistent accounting method of transactional data reporting, based on the Contractor's established commercial accounting practice.
                (7) Reporting Points.
                (i) The acceptable points at which transactional data may be reported include—
                (A) Issuance of an invoice; or
                (B) Receipt of payment.
                (ii) The Contractor must determine whether to report transactional data on the basis of invoices issued or payments received.
                (8) The Contractor must continue to furnish reports, including confirmation of no transactional data, through physical completion of the last outstanding task or delivery order of the contract.
                (9) Unless otherwise expressly stated by the ordering activity, orders that contain classified information or other or information that would compromise national security are exempt from this reporting requirement.
                (10) This clause does not exempt the Contractor from fulfilling existing reporting requirements contained elsewhere in the contract.
                (11) GSA reserves the unilateral right to change reporting instructions following 60 calendar days' advance notification to the Contractor.
                (c) Industrial Funding Fee (IFF).
                
                (1) This contract includes an IFF charged on orders placed against this contract. The IFF is paid by the authorized ordering activity but remitted to GSA by the Contractor. The IFF reimburses GSA for the costs of operating the Federal Supply Schedule program, as set forth in 40 U.S.C. 321: Acquisition Services Fund. Net operating revenues generated by the IFF are also applied to fund initiatives benefitting other authorized GSA programs, in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 321.

                (2) GSA has the unilateral right to change the fee amount at any time, but not more than once per year; GSA will provide reasonable notice prior to the effective date of any change. GSA will post notice of the current IFF on the Vendor Support Center website at https://vsc.gsa.gov.

                (3) Offerors must include the IFF in their prices. The fee is included in the awarded price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities. The fee will not be included in the price of non-contract items purchased pursuant to a separate contracting authority, such as a Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC); a separately awarded Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, FAR Part 13, FAR Part 14, or FAR Part 15 procurement; or a non-FAR contract.
                (4) The Contractor must remit the IFF to GSA in U.S. dollars within 30 calendar days after the last calendar day of the reporting quarter; final payment must be remitted within 30 calendar days after physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order issued against the contract.
                (5) GSA reserves the unilateral right to change remittance instructions following 60 calendar days' advance notification to the Contractor.
                (d) The Contractor's failure to remit the full amount of the IFF within 30 calendar days after the end of the applicable reporting period constitutes a contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR Subpart 32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or offsetting payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17, Interest). If the Contractor fails to submit the required transactional data reports, falsifies them, or fails to timely pay the IFF, these reasons constitute sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for cause.

                Price Reductions (MAY 2019)
                (a) Before award of a contract, the Contracting Officer and the Offeror will agree upon (1) the customer (or category of customers) which will be the basis of award, and (2) the Government's price or discount relationship to the identified customer (or category of customers). This relationship shall be maintained throughout the contract period. Any change in the Contractor's commercial pricing or discount arrangement applicable to the identified customer (or category of customers) which disturbs this relationship shall constitute a price reduction.
                (b) During the contract period, the Contractor shall report to the Contracting Officer all price reductions to the customer (or category of customers) that was the basis of award. The Contractor's report shall include an explanation of the conditions under which the reductions were made.
                (c)(1) A price reduction shall apply to purchases under this contract if, after the date negotiations conclude, the Contractor—
                (i) Revises the commercial catalog, pricelist, schedule or other document upon which contract award was predicated to reduce prices;
                (ii) Grants more favorable discounts or terms and conditions than those contained in the commercial catalog, pricelist, schedule or other documents upon which contract award was predicated; or
                (iii) Grants special discounts to the customer (or category of customers) that formed the basis of award, and the change disturbs the price/discount relationship of the Government to the customer (or category of customers) that was the basis of award.
                (2) The Contractor shall offer the price reduction to the eligible ordering activity with the same effective date, and for the same time period, as extended to the commercial customer (or category of customers).
                (d) There shall be no price reduction for sales—
                (1) To commercial customers under firm, fixed-price definite quantity contracts with specified delivery in excess of the maximum order threshold specified in this contract;
                (2) To Federal agencies;
                (3) Made to Eligible Ordering Activities identified in GSAR Clause 552.238-113 when the order is placed under this contract (and the Eligible Ordering Activities identified in GSAR Clause 552.238-113 is the agreed upon customer or category of customer that is the basis of award); or
                (4) Caused by an error in quotation or billing, provided adequate documentation is furnished by the Contractor to the Contracting Officer.
                (e) The Contractor may offer the Contracting Officer a voluntary Governmentwide price reduction at any time during the contract period.
                (f) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any price reduction subject to this clause as soon as possible, but not later than 15 calendar days after its effective date.
                (g) The contract will be modified to reflect any price reduction which becomes applicable in accordance with this clause.

                (b) The Contractor may offer the Contracting Officer a voluntary price reduction at any time during the contract period.

                (3) Price reduction. The Contractor shall indicate whether the price reduction falls under the item (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (c)(1) of the Price Reductions clause at 552.238-81.

                (d) Electronic file updates. The Contractor shall update electronic file submissions to reflect all modifications.

                (e) Amendments to paper Federal Supply Schedule Price Lists. (1) The Contractor must provide supplements to its paper price lists, reflecting the most current changes. The Contractor may either:

                Discounts for Prompt Payment (MAY 2019)
                (a) Discounts for early payment (hereinafter referred to as “discounts” or “the discount”) will be considered in evaluating the relationship of the Offeror's concessions to the Government vis-a-vis the Offeror's concessions to its commercial and Federal non-schedule customers, but only to the extent indicated in this clause.
                (b) Discounts will not be considered to determine the low Offeror in the situation described in the “Offers on Identical Products” provision of this solicitation.

                (c) Uneconomical discounts will not be considered as meeting the criteria for award established by the Government. In this connection, a discount will be considered uneconomical if the annualized rate of return for earning the discount is lower than the “value of funds” rate established by the Department of the Treasury and published quarterly in the Federal Register. The “value of funds” rate applied will be the rate in effect on the date specified for the receipt of offers.
                (d) Discounts for early payment may be offered either in the original offer or on individual invoices submitted under the resulting contract. Discounts offered will be taken by the ordering activity if payment is made within the discount period specified.
                (e) Discounts that are included in offers become a part of the resulting contracts and are binding on the Contractor for all orders placed under the contract. Discounts offered only on individual invoices will be binding on the Contractor only for the particular invoice on which the discount is offered.
                (f) In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the date on which an electronic funds transfer was made.

Where dealers are allowed by the Contractor to bill ordering activities and accept payment in the Contractor's name, the Contractor agrees to obtain from all dealers participating in the performance of the contract a written agreement, which will require dealers to—
                (1) Comply with the same terms and conditions as the Contractor for sales made under the contract;
                (2) Maintain a system of reporting sales under the contract to the manufacturer, which includes—

                (3) Be subject to audit by the Government, with respect to sales made under the contract; and
                (4) Place orders and accept payments in the name of the Contractor in care of the dealer.
                (b) An agreement between a Contractor and its dealers pursuant to this procedure will not establish privity of contract between dealers and the Government.

                (1) Delivery to the door of the specified Government activity by freight or express common carriers on articles for which store-door delivery is provided, free or subject to a charge, pursuant to regularly published tariffs duly filed with the Federal and/or State regulatory bodies governing such carrier; or, at the option of the Contractor, by parcel post on mailable articles, or by the Contractor's vehicle. Where store-door delivery is subject to a charge, the Contractor shall place the notation “Delivery Service Requested” on bills of lading covering such shipments, and pay such charge and add the actual cost thereof as a separate item to his invoice.
                (2) Delivery to siding at destinations when specified by the ordering office, if delivery is not covered under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

The Contractor shall add the actual cost of transportation to destination from the point of exportation in the 48 contiguous States nearest to the designated destination. Such costs will, in all cases, be based upon the lowest regularly established rates on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission, the U.S. Maritime Commission (if shipped by water), or any State regulatory body, or those published by the U.S. Postal Service; and must be supported by paid freight or express receipt or by a statement of parcel post charges including weight of shipment.

                Separate Charge for Delivery within Consignee's Premises (MAY 2019)
                (a) Offerors are requested to insert, in the spaces provided below or by attachment hereto, a separate charge for “Delivery Within Consignee's Premises” applicable to each shipping container to be shipped. (Articles which are comparable in size and weight, and for which the same charge is applicable, should be grouped under an appropriate item description.) These additional charges will be accepted as part of the award, if considered reasonable, and shall be included in the Contractor's published catalog and/or price list.
                (b) Ordering activities are not obligated to issue orders on the basis of “Delivery Within Consignee's Premises,” and Contractors may refuse delivery on that basis provided such refusal is communicated in writing to the ordering activity issuing such orders within 5 days of the receipt of such order by the Contractor and provided further, that delivery is made in accordance with the other delivery requirements of the contract. Failure of the Contractor to submit this notification within the time specified shall constitute acceptance to furnish “Delivery Within Consignee's Premises” at the additional charge awarded. When an ordering activity issues an order on the basis of “Delivery Within Consignee's Premises” at the accepted additional charge awarded and the Contractor accepts such orders on that basis, the Contractor will be obligated to provide delivery “F.o.b. Destination, Within Consignee's Premises” in accordance with FAR 52.247-35, which is then incorporated by reference, with the exception that an additional charge as provided herein is allowed for such services. Unless otherwise stipulated by the Offeror, the additional charges awarded hereunder may be applied to any delivery within the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia.
                (c) When exercising their option to issue orders on the basis of delivery service as provided herein, ordering activities will specify “Delivery Within Consignee's Premises” on the order, and will indicate the exact location to which delivery is to be made. The Contractor's delivery price and the additional charge(s) for “Delivery Within Consignee's Premises” will be shown as separate entries on the order.

              Electronic Commerce.
              As prescribed in 538.273(d)(27), insert the following clause:
              
                Electronic Commerce (MAY 2019)
                (a) General background. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 requires the Government to evolve its acquisition process from one driven by paper to an expedited process based on electronic commerce/electronic data interchange (EC/EDI). EC/EDI encompasses more than merely automating manual processes and eliminating paper transactions. EC/EDI improves business processes (e.g. procurement, finance, logistics) into a fully electronic environment and fundamentally changes the way organizations operate.
                (b) Trading partners and Value-Added Networks (VAN's).
                
                (1) Within the electronic commerce architecture, electronic documents (e.g., orders, invoices, etc.) are carried between the Federal Government's procuring office and Contractors (now known as “trading partners”). These transactions are carried by commercial telecommunications companies called Value-Added Networks (VAN's).
                (2) EDI can be performed using commercially available hardware, software, and telecommunications. The selection of a VAN is a business decision Contractors must make. There are many different VAN's which provide a variety of electronic services and different pricing strategies. If the VAN only provides communications services, you may also need a software translation package.
                (c) Registration instructions. To perform EDI with the Government, Contractors shall register as a trading partner. Contractors will provide regular business information, banking information, and EDI capabilities to all agencies in this single registration. A central repository of all trading partners is the Systems for Award Management (SAM) http://www.sam.gov. Contractors shall follow the instructions on the SAM website regarding how to register for EDI.
                (d) Implementation conventions. All EDI transactions must comply with the Federal Implementation Conventions (ICs). The ICs are available on a registry maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is accessible via the INTERNET at http://www.nist.gov/itl. ICs are available for common business documents such as Purchase Order, Price Sales Catalog, Invoice, Request for Quotes, etc.
                (e) Additional information. GSA has additional information available for Contractors who are interested in using EC/EDI on its website, www.gsa.gov.
                (f) GSA Advantage!®. (1) GSA Advantage!® uses electronic commerce to receive catalogs, invoices and text messages; and to send purchase orders, application advice, and functional acknowledgments. GSA Advantage!® enables customers to:
                (i) Perform database searches across all contracts by manufacturer; manufacturer's model/part number; Contractor; and generic supply categories.
                (ii) Generate EDI delivery orders to Contractors, generate EDI delivery orders from the Federal Supply Service to Contractors, or download files to create their own delivery orders.
                (iii) Use the credit card.

                (2) GSA Advantage!® may be accessed via the GSA Home Page. The internet address is: http://www.gsa.gov.

              Authentication Supplies and Services.
              As prescribed in 538.273(d)(33), insert the following clause:
              
                Authentication Supplies and Services (MAY 2019)
                (a) General background. (1) The General Services Administration (GSA) established the “Identity and Access Management Services” (IAMS) Program to clearly define the kinds of digital certificates and PKI services that meet the requirements for service providers and supplies that support FISMA-compliant IAM systems deployed by Federal agencies.
                (2) Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), “Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors” establishes the requirement for a mandatory Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees and Contractor employees assigned to Government contracts in order to enhance security, increase Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy. Further, the Directive requires the Department of Commerce to promulgate a Federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification within six months of the date of the Directive. As a result, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2: Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors August 2013. FIPS 201-2 requires that the digital certificates incorporated into the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) identity credentials comply with the X.509 Certificate Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework. In addition, FIPS 201-2 requires that Federal identity badges referred to as PIV credentials, issued to Federal employees and Contractors comply with the Standard and associated NIST Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, 800-78, and 800-79.
                (b) Special item numbers. GSA has established the e-Authentication Initiative (see URL: http://www.idmanagement.gov) to provide common infrastructure for the authentication of the public and internal Federal users for logical access to Federal e-Government applications and electronic services. To support the government-wide implementation of HSPD-12 and the Federal e-Authentication Initiative, GSA has established Special Item Numbers (SINs) pertaining to Authentication Products and Services, including Electronic Credentials, Digital Certificates, eAuthentication, Identify and Access Management, PKI Shared Service Providers, and HSPD-12 Product and Service Components.
                (c) Qualification information. (1) All Authentication supplies and services must be qualified as being compliant with Government-wide requirements before they will be included on a GSA Information Technology (IT) Schedule contract. The Qualification Requirements and associated evaluation procedures against the Qualification Requirements for each SIN and the specific Qualification Requirements for HSPD-12 implementation components are presented at the following URL: http://www.idmanagement.gov.
                
                (2) In addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has established the NIST Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP) to evaluate integrated circuit chip cards and supplies against conformance requirements contained in FIPS 201. GSA has established the FIPS 201Evaluation Program to evaluate other supplies needed for agency implementation of HSPD-12 requirements where normative requirements are specified in FIPS 201 and to perform card and reader interface testing for interoperability. Products that are approved as FIPS-201 compliant through these evaluation and testing programs may be offered directly through HSPD-12 Supplies and Services Components SIN under the category “Approved FIPS 201-Compliant Products and services.
                (d) Qualification requirements. Offerors proposing Authentication supplies and services under the established SINs are required to provide the following:

                (1) Proposed items must be determined to be compliant with Federal requirements for that SIN. Qualification Requirements and procedures for the evaluation of supplies and services are posted at the URL: http://www.idmanagement.gov. GSA will follow these procedures in qualifying offeror's supplies and services against the Qualification Requirements for applicable to SIN. Offerors must submit all documentation certification letter(s) for Authentication Supplies and Services offerings at the same time as submission of proposal. Award will be dependent upon receipt of official documentation from the Acquisition Program Management Office (APMO) listed below verifying satisfactory qualification against the Qualification Requirements of the proposed SIN(s).
                (2) After award, Contractor agrees that certified supplies and services will not be offered under any other SIN on any Federal Supply Schedule
                (3)(i) If the Contractor changes the supplies or services previously qualified, GSA may require the Contractor to resubmit the supplies or services for re-qualification.
                (ii) If the Federal Government changes the qualification requirements or standards, Contractor must resubmit the supplies and services for re-qualification.

                (4) Immediately prior to making an award, Contracting Officers MUST consult the following website to ensure that the supplies and/or services recommended for award under any Authentication Supplies and Services SINs are in compliance with the latest APL qualification standards: www.idmanagement.gov. A dated copy of the applicable page should be made and included with the award documents.
                (e) Demonstrating conformance. (1) The Federal Government has established Qualification Requirements for demonstrating conformance with the Standards. The following websites provide additional information regarding the evaluation and qualification processes:

                (i) For Identify and Access Management Services (IAMS) and PKI Shared Service Provider (SSP) Qualification Requirements and evaluation procedures: http://www.idmanagement.gov;

                (d) Portability. The Contractor shall have the capability to redeploy COMSATCOM services, subject to availability. Portability shall be provided within the COMSATCOM Contractor's resources at any time as requested by the ordering activity. When portability is exercised, evidence of equivalent net present value (NPV) shall be provided by the Contractor.
                (e) Flexibility/optimization. The Contractor shall have the capability to re-groom resources for spectral, operational, or price efficiencies. Flexibility/optimization shall be provided within the COMSATCOM Contractor's resources at any time as requested by the ordering activity. When flexibility/optimization is exercised, evidence of equivalent net present value (NPV) shall be provided by the Contractor. The Contractor is encouraged to submit re-grooming approaches for ordering activity consideration that may increase efficiencies for existing COMSATCOM services.
                (f) Net ready (interoperability). COMSATCOM services shall be consistent with commercial standards and practices. Services shall have the capability to access and/or interoperate with Government or other Commercial teleports/gateways and provide enterprise service access to or among networks or enclaves. Interfaces may be identified as interoperable on the basis of participation in a sponsored interoperability program.
                (g) Network monitoring (Net OPS). The Contractor shall have the capability to electronically collect and deliver near real-time monitoring, fault/incident/outage reporting, and information access to ensure effective and efficient operations, performance, and availability, consistent with commercial practices. Consistent with the Contractor's standard management practices, the Net Ops information will be provided on a frequency (example: Every 6 hours, daily) and format (example: SNMP, XML) as defined in a requirement to a location/entity/electronic interface defined by the ordering activity. Specific reporting requirements will be defined by the Ordering Activity.
                (h) EMI/RFI identification, characterization, and geo-location. The Contractor shall have the capability to collect and electronically report in near real-time Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI)/Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) identification, characterization, and geo-location, including the ability to identify and characterize sub-carrier EMI/RFI being transmitted underneath an authorized carrier, and the ability to geo-locate the source of any and all EMI/RFI. The Contractor shall establish and use with the ordering activity a mutually agreed upon media and voice communications capability capable of protecting “Sensitive, but Unclassified” data.
                (i) Security. (1) The Contractor may be required to obtain/possess varying levels of personnel and facility security clearances up to U.S. Government TOP SECRET/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) or equivalent clearances assigned by the National Security Authority of a NATO Member State or Major Non-NATO Ally.
                (2) For incident resolution involving classified matters, the Contractor shall provide appropriately cleared staff who can affect COMSATCOM services operations (example: Satellite payload operations, network operations). The Contractor shall provide a minimum of one operations staff member AND a minimum of one person with the authority to commit the company if resolution requires business impacting decisions (example: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operations Officer, etc.).
                (3) When Communications Security or Transmission Security equipment or keying material is placed in the equipment/terminal shelter, the Contractor shall ensure compliance with applicable physical security directives/guidelines and that all deployed equipment/terminal operations and maintenance personnel shall possess the appropriate clearances, equal to or higher than the classification level of the data being transmitted. Where local regulations require use of foreign personnel for terminal operations and maintenance, then the Contractor shall ensure compliance with applicable security directives/guidelines and document to the U.S. Government's satisfaction that protective measures are in place and such individuals have equivalent clearances granted by the local host nation.
                (4) For classified operations security (OPSEC), the Contractor shall ensure that all personnel in direct contact with classified OPSEC indicators (example: The unit, location, and time of operations) have U.S. SECRET or higher personnel security clearances, or, as appropriate, equivalent clearances assigned by the National Security Authority of a NATO Member State or Major Non-NATO Ally, in accordance with applicable security directives and guidelines.

                (5) For classified requirements, cleared satellite operator staff must have access to secure voice communications for emergency purposes. Communications security equipment certified by the National Security Agency (NSA) to secure unclassified and up to and including SECRET communication transmissions at all operations centers is preferred. If a Contractor is unable to have access to NSA-approved communications security equipment at its operations centers, then a combination of a “Sensitive but Unclassified” (SBU) cryptographic module approved by the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology and pre-arranged access to National Security Agency-approved communications security equipment at an agreed alternate facility is acceptable.
                (6) The Contractor shall have the capability to “mask” or “protect” users against unauthorized release of identifying information to any entity that could compromise operations security. Identifying information includes but is not limited to personal user and/or unit information including tail numbers, unit names, unit numbers, individual names, individual contact numbers, street addresses, etc.
                (j) Third party billing for COMSATCOM subscription services. The Contractor shall identify authorized network infrastructure for the ordering activity. In some cases, the user of the terminal may access network infrastructure owned or operated by a third party. In the event a terminal is used on a third party's network infrastructure, the Contractor shall provide to the ordering activity, invoices and documentation reflecting actual usage amount and third party charges incurred. The ordering activity shall be billed the actual third party charges incurred, or the contract third party billing price, whichever is less.

              Use of Federal Supply Schedule Contracts by Non-Federal Entities.
              As prescribed in 538.7004(c), insert the following clause:
              
                Use of Federal Supply Schedule Contracts by Non-Federal Entities (MAY 2019)
                (a) If an entity identified in paragraph (d) of the clause at 552.238-113, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities), elects to place an order under this contract, the entity agrees that the order shall be subject to the following conditions:
                (1) When the Contractor accepts an order from such an entity, a separate contract is formed which incorporates by reference all the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract except the Disputes clause, the patent indemnity clause, and the portion of the Commercial Item Contract Terms and Conditions that specifies “Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts” (which applies only to contracts with entities of the Executive branch of the U.S. Government). The parties to this new contract which incorporates the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract are the individual ordering activity and the Contractor. The U.S. Government shall not be liable for the performance or nonperformance of the new contract. Disputes which cannot be resolved by the parties to the new contract may be litigated in any State or Federal court with jurisdiction over the parties, applying Federal procurement law, including statutes, regulations and case law, and, if pertinent, the Uniform Commercial Code. To the extent authorized by law, parties to this new contract are encouraged to resolve disputes through Alternative Dispute Resolution. Likewise, a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), although not a contract, is an agreement that may be entered into by the Contractor with such an entity and the Federal Government is not a party.
                (2) Where contract clauses refer to action by a Contracting Officer or a Contracting Officer of GSA, that shall mean the individual responsible for placing the order for the ordering activity (e.g., FAR 52.212-4 at paragraph (f) and FSS clause I-FSS-249 B.)
                (3) As a condition of using this contract, eligible ordering activities agree to abide by all terms and conditions of the Schedule contract, except for those deleted clauses or portions of clauses mentioned in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause. Ordering activities may include terms and conditions required by statute, ordinance, regulation, order, or as otherwise allowed by State and local government entities as a part of a statement of work (SOW) or statement of objective (SOO) to the extent that these terms and conditions do not conflict with the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract. The ordering activity and the Contractor expressly acknowledge that, in entering into an agreement for the ordering activity to purchase goods or services from the Contractor, neither the ordering activity nor the Contractor will look to, primarily or in any secondary capacity, or file any claim against the United States or any of its agencies with respect to any failure of performance by the other party.
                (4) The ordering activity is responsible for all payments due the Contractor under the contract formed by acceptance of the ordering activity's order, without recourse to the agency of the U.S. Government, which awarded the Schedule contract.
                (5) The Contractor is encouraged, but not obligated, to accept orders from such entities. The Contractor may, within 5 days of receipt of the order, decline to accept any order, for any reason. The Contractor shall fulfill orders placed by such entities, which are not declined within the 5-day period.
                (6) The supplies or services purchased will be used for governmental purposes only and will not be resold for personal use. Disposal of property acquired will be in accordance with the established procedures of the ordering activity for the disposal of personal property.
                (b) If the Schedule Contractor accepts an order from an entity identified in paragraph (d) of the clause at 552.238-113, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities), the Contractor agrees to the following conditions:

                (1) The ordering activity is responsible for all payments due the Contractor for the contract formed by acceptance of the order, without recourse to the agency of the U.S. Government, which awarded the Schedule contract.
                
                (2) The Contractor is encouraged, but not obligated, to accept orders from such entities. The Contractor may, within 5 days of receipt of the order, decline to accept any order, for any reason. The Contractor shall decline the order using the same means as those used to place the order. The Contractor shall fulfill orders placed by such entities, which are not declined within the 5-day period.
                (c) In accordance with clause 552.238-80, Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting, the Contractor must report the quarterly dollar value of all sales under this contract. When submitting sales reports, the Contractor must report two dollar values for each Special Item Number:
                (1) The dollar value for sales to entities identified in paragraph (a) of the clause at 552.238-113, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities), and
                (2) The dollar value for sales to entities identified in paragraph (d) of clause 552.238-113 Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities).

              Special Ordering Procedures for the Acquisition of Order-Level Materials.
              As prescribed in 538.7204(b), insert the following clause:
              
                Special Ordering Procedures for the Acquisition of Order-Level Materials (MAY 2019)
                (a) Definition.
                
                
                  Order-level materials means supplies and/or services acquired in direct support of an individual task or delivery order placed against a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract or FSS blanket purchase agreement (BPA), when the supplies and/or services are not known at the time of Schedule contract or FSS BPA award. The prices of order-level materials are not established in the FSS contract or FSS BPA. Order-level materials acquired following the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section are done so under the authority of the FSS program, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 152(3), and are not open market items, which are discussed in FAR 8.402(f).
                (b) FAR 8.403(b) provides that GSA may establish special ordering procedures for a particular FSS.
                (c) The procedures in FAR subpart 8.4 apply to this contract, with the exceptions listed in this clause. If a requirement in this clause is inconsistent with FAR subpart 8.4, this clause takes precedence pursuant to FAR 8.403(b).
                (d) Procedures for including order-level materials when placing an individual task or delivery order against an FSS contract or FSS BPA.
                (1) The procedures discussed in FAR 8.402(f) do not apply when placing task and delivery orders that include order-level materials.
                (2) Order-level materials are included in the definition of the term “material” in FAR clause 52.212-4 Alternate I, and therefore all provisions of FAR clause 52.212-4 Alternate I that apply to “materials” also apply to order-level materials. The ordering activity shall follow procedures under the Federal Travel Regulation and FAR Part 31 when order-level materials include travel.
                (3) Order-level materials shall only be acquired in direct support of an individual task or delivery order and not as the primary basis or purpose of the order.
                (4) The value of order-level materials in a task or delivery order, or the cumulative value of order-level materials in orders against an FSS BPA awarded under a FSS contract shall not exceed 33.33%.
                (5) All order-level materials shall be placed under the Order-Level Materials SIN.
                (6) Prior to the placement of an order that includes order-level materials, the Ordering Activity shall follow procedures in FAR 8.404(h).
                (7) To support the price reasonableness of order-level materials—
                (i) The contractor proposing order-level materials as part of a solution shall obtain a minimum of three quotes for each order-level material above the simplified acquisition threshold.
                (A) One of these three quotes may include materials furnished by the contractor under FAR 52.212-4 Alt I (i)(1)(ii)(A).
                (B) If the contractor cannot obtain three quotes, the contractor shall maintain its documentation of why three quotes could not be obtained to support their determination.
                (C) A contractor with an approved purchasing system per FAR 44.3 shall instead follow its purchasing system requirement and is exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (d)(7)(i)(A)-(B) of this clause.
                (ii) The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer must make a determination that prices for all order-level materials are fair and reasonable. The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer may base this determination on a comparison of the quotes received in response to the task or delivery order solicitation or other relevant pricing information available.

                (iii) If indirect costs are approved per FAR 52.212-4(i)(1)(ii)(D)(2) Alternate I), the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer must make a determination that all indirect costs approved for payment are fair and reasonable. Supporting data shall be submitted in a form acceptable to the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer.
                
                (8) Prior to an increase in the ceiling price of order-level materials, the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures at FAR 8.404(h)(3)(iv).
                (9) In accordance with GSAR clause 552.238-83, Examination of Records by GSA, GSA has the authority to examine the Contractor's records for compliance with the pricing provisions in FAR clause 52.212-4 Alternate I, to include examination of any books, documents, papers, and records involving transactions related to the contract for overbillings, billing errors, and compliance with the IFF and the Sales Reporting clauses of the contract.
                (10) OLMs are exempt from the following clauses:

              As prescribed in 539.7002(b), insert the following clause:
              
                Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources (JAN 2012)
                (a) General. The Contractor shall be responsible for information technology (IT) security, based on General Services Administration (GSA) risk assessments, for all systems connected to a GSA network or operated by the Contractor for GSA, regardless of location. This clause is applicable to all or any part of the contract that includes information technology resources or services in which the Contractor has physical or electronic access to GSA's information that directly supports the mission of GSA, as indicated by GSA. The term information technology, as used in this clause, means any equipment, including telecommunications equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information. This includes major applications as defined by OMB Circular A-130. Examples of tasks that require security provisions include:
                (1) Hosting of GSA e-Government sites or other IT operations;
                (2) Acquisition, transmission, or analysis of data owned by GSA with significant replacement cost should the Contractors copy be corrupted;
                (3) Access to GSA major applications at a level beyond that granted the general public; e.g., bypassing a firewall; and
                (4) Any new information technology systems acquired for operations within the GSA must comply with the requirements of HSPD-12 and OMB M-11-11. Usage of the credentials must be implemented in accordance with OMB policy and NIST guidelines (e.g., NIST SP 800-116). The system must operate within the GSA's access management environment. Exceptions must be requested in writing and can only be granted by the GSA Senior Agency Information Security Officer.
                (b) IT Security Plan. The Contractor shall develop, provide, implement, and maintain an IT Security Plan. This plan shall describe the processes and procedures that will be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources that are developed, processed, or used under this contract.

The plan shall meet IT security requirements in accordance with Federal and GSA policies and procedures. GSA's Office of the Chief Information Officer issued “CIO IT Security Procedural Guide 09-48, Security Language for Information Technology Acquisitions Efforts,” to provide IT security standards, policies and reporting requirements. This document is incorporated by reference in all solicitations and contracts or task orders where an information system is contractor owned and operated on behalf of the Federal Government. The guide can be accessed at http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25690. Specific security requirements not specified in “CIO IT Security Procedural Guide 09-48, Security Language for Information Technology Acquisitions Efforts” shall be provided by the requiring activity.
                (c) Submittal of IT Security Plan. Within 30 calendar days after contract award, the Contractor shall submit the IT Security Plan to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officers Representative (COR) for acceptance. This plan shall be consistent with and further detail the approach contained in the contractors proposal or sealed bid that resulted in the award of this contract and in compliance with the requirements stated in this clause. The plan, as accepted by the Contracting Officer and COR, shall be incorporated into the contract as a compliance document. The Contractor shall comply with the accepted plan.
                (d) Submittal of a Continuous Monitoring Plan. The Contractor must develop a continuous monitoring strategy that includes:
                (1) A configuration management process for the information system and its constituent components;

                (4) Reporting the security state of the information system to appropriate GSA officials; and

                (5) All GSA general support systems and applications must implement continuous monitoring activities in accordance with this guide and NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.
                
                (e) Security authorization. Within six (6) months after contract award, the Contractor shall submit written proof of IT security authorization for acceptance by the Contracting Officer. Such written proof may be furnished either by the Contractor or by a third party. The security authorization must be in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-37. This security authorization will include a final security plan, risk assessment, security test and evaluation, and disaster recovery plan/continuity of operations plan. This security authorization, when accepted by the Contracting Officer, shall be incorporated into the contract as a compliance document, and shall include a final security plan, a risk assessment, security test and evaluation, and disaster recovery/continuity of operations plan. The Contractor shall comply with the accepted security authorization documentation.
                (f) Annual verification. On an annual basis, the Contractor shall submit verification to the Contracting Officer that the IT Security plan remains valid.
                (g) Warning notices. The Contractor shall ensure that the following banners are displayed on all GSA systems (both public and private) operated by the Contractor prior to allowing anyone access to the system:
                     Government Warning

                (k) GSA access. The Contractor shall afford GSA access to the Contractor's and subcontractors' facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases, IT systems and devices, and personnel used in performance of the contract, regardless of the location. Access shall be provided to the extent required, in GSA's judgment, to conduct an inspection, evaluation, investigation or audit, including vulnerability testing to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of GSA data or to the function of information technology systems operated on behalf of GSA, and to preserve evidence of computer crime. This information shall be available to GSA upon request.
                (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts that meet the conditions in paragraph (a) of this clause.
                (m) Notification regarding employees.

              Equitable Adjustments.
              As prescribed in 543.205, insert the following clause:
              
                Equitable Adjustments (MAR 2019)
                (a) This clause governs the determination of equitable adjustments to which the Contractor may be entitled under the “Changes” clause prescribed by FAR 52.243-4, the “Changes and Changed Conditions” clause prescribed by FAR 52.243-5, the “Differing Site Conditions” clause prescribed by FAR 52.236-2, and any other provision of this contract allowing entitlement to an equitable adjustment. This clause does not govern determination of the Contractor's relief allowable under the “Suspension of Work” clause prescribed by FAR 52.242-14.
                (b) At the written request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall submit a proposal, in accordance with the requirements set forth herein, for an equitable adjustment to the contract for changes or other conditions that may entitle a Contractor to an equitable adjustment. If the Contractor deems an oral or written order to be a change to the contract, it shall promptly submit to the Contracting Officer a proposal for equitable adjustment attributable to such deemed change. The proposal shall also conform to the requirements set forth herein.
                (c) The proposal shall be submitted within the time specified in the “Changes”, “Changes and Changed Conditions”, or “Differing Site Conditions” clause, as applicable, or such other time as may reasonably be required by the Contracting Officer.
                (d) Proposals for equitable adjustments, including no cost requests for adjustment of the contract's required completion date, shall include a detailed breakdown of the following elements, as applicable:
                (1) Direct costs.
                (2) Markups.
                (3) Change to the time for completion specified in the contract.
                (e) Direct costs. The Contractor shall separately identify each item of deleted and added work associated with the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment, including increases or decreases to unchanged work impacted by the change. For each item of work so identified, the Contractor shall propose for itself and, if applicable, its first two tiers of subcontractors, the following direct costs:
                (1) Material cost broken down by trade, supplier, material description, quantity of material units, and unit cost (including all manufacturing burden associated with material fabrication and cost of delivery to site, unless separately itemized);
                (2) Labor cost broken down by trade, employer, occupation, quantity of labor hours, and burdened hourly labor rate, together with itemization of applied labor burdens (exclusive of employer's overhead, profit, and any labor cost burdens carried in employer's overhead rate);
                (3) Cost of equipment required to perform the work, identified with material to be placed or operation to be performed;
                (4) Cost of preparation and/or revision to shop drawings and other submittals with detail set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this clause;
                (5) Delivery costs, if not included in material unit costs;
                (6) Time-related costs not separately identified as direct costs, and not included in the Contractor's or subcontractors' overhead rates, as specified in paragraph (g) of this clause; and
                (7) Other direct costs.
                (f) Marked-up costs of subcontractors below the second tier may be treated as other direct costs of a second tier subcontractor, unless the Contracting Officer requires a detailed breakdown under paragraph (i) of this clause.
                (g) Extensions of Time and Time-Related Costs. The Contractor shall propose a daily rate for each firm's time-related costs during the affected period, and, for each firm, the increase or decrease in the number of work days of performance attributable to the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment, with supporting analysis. Entitlement to time and time-related costs shall be determined as follows:
                (1) Increases or decreases to a firm's time-related costs shall be allowed only if such increase or decrease necessarily and exclusively results from the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment.
                (2) The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or recovery of its own time-related costs except to the extent that such change or other condition necessarily and exclusively causes its duration of performance to extend beyond the completion date specified in the contract.
                (3) Costs may be characterized as time-related costs only if they are incurred solely to support performance of this contract and the increase or decrease in such costs is solely dependent upon the duration of a firm's performance of work.
                (4) Costs may not be characterized as time-related costs if they are included in the calculation of a firm's overhead rate.

                (5) Equitable adjustment of time and time-related costs shall not be allowed unless the analysis supporting the proposal complies with provisions specified elsewhere in this contract regarding the Contractor's project schedule.
                (h) Markups. For each firm whose direct costs are separately identified in the proposal, the Contractor shall propose an overhead rate, profit rate, and where applicable, a bond rate and insurance rate. Markups shall be determined and applied as follows:
                (1) Overhead rates shall be negotiated, and may be subject to audit and adjustment.
                (2) Profit rates shall be negotiated, but shall not exceed ten percent, unless entitlement to a higher rate of profit may be demonstrated.
                (3) The Contractor and its subcontractor[s] shall not be allowed overhead or profit on the overhead or profit received by a subcontractor, except to the extent that the subcontractor's costs are properly included in other direct costs as specified in paragraph (f) of this clause.
                (4) Overhead rates shall be applied to the direct costs of work performed by a firm, and shall not be allowed on the direct costs of work performed by a subcontractor to that firm at any tier except as set forth below in paragraphs (h)(6) and (h)(7) of this clause.
                (5) Profit rates shall be applied to the sum of a firm's direct costs and the overhead allowed on the direct costs of work performed by that firm.
                (6) Overhead and profit shall be allowed on the direct costs of work performed by a subcontractor within two tiers of a firm at rates equal to only fifty percent of the overhead and profit rates negotiated pursuant to paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this clause for that firm, but not in excess of ten percent when combined.
                (7) Overhead and profit shall not be allowed on the direct costs of a subcontractor more than two tiers below the firm claiming overhead and profit for subcontractor direct costs.
                (8) If changes to a Contractor's or subcontractor's bond or insurance premiums are computed as a percentage of the gross change in contract value, markups for bond and insurance shall be applied after all overhead and profit is applied. Bond and insurance rates shall not be applied if the associated costs are included in the calculation of a firm's overhead rate.
                (9) No markup shall be applied to a firm's costs other than those specified herein.
                (i) At the request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide such other information as may be reasonably necessary to allow evaluation of the proposal. If the proposal includes significant costs incurred by a subcontractor below the second tier, the Contracting Officer may require the same detail for those costs as required for the first two tiers of subcontractors, and markups shall be applied to these subcontractor costs in accordance with paragraph (h).
                (j) Proposal Preparation Costs. If performed by the firm claiming them, proposal preparations costs shall be included in the labor hours proposed as direct costs. If performed by an outside consultant or law firm, proposal preparation costs shall be treated as other direct costs to the firm incurring them. Requests for proposal preparation costs shall include the following:
                (1) A copy of the contract or other documentation identifying the consultant or firm, the scope of the services performed, the manner in which the consultant or firm was to be compensated, and if compensation was paid on an hourly basis, the fully burdened and marked-up hourly rates for the services provided.
                (2) If compensation was paid on an hourly basis, documentation of the quantity of hours worked, including descriptions of the activities for which the hours were billed, and applicable rates.
                (3) Written proof of payment of the costs requested. The sufficiency of the proof shall be determined by the Contracting Officer.
                (k) Proposal preparation costs shall be allowed only if—
                (1) The nature and complexity of the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment warrants estimating, scheduling, or other effort not reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract award;
                (2) Proposed costs are not included in a firm's time-related costs or overhead rate; and
                (3) Proposed costs were incurred prior to a Contracting Officer's unilateral determination of an equitable adjustment under the conditions set forth in paragraph (o), or were incurred prior to the time the request for equitable adjustment otherwise became a matter in dispute.
                (l) Proposed direct costs, markups, and proposal preparation costs shall be allowable in the determination of an equitable adjustment only if they are reasonable and otherwise consistent with the contract cost principles and procedures set forth in part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 31) in effect on the date of this contract. Characterization of costs as direct costs, time-related costs, or overhead costs must be consistent with the requesting firm's accounting practices on other work under this contract and other contracts.

                (m) If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the Government's interest that the Contractor proceed with a change before negotiation of an equitable adjustment is completed, the Contracting Officer may order the Contractor to proceed on the basis of a unilateral modification to the contract increasing or decreasing the contract price by an amount to be determined later. Such increase or decrease shall not exceed the increase or decrease proposed by the Contractor.
                (n) If the parties cannot agree to an equitable adjustment, the Contracting Officer may determine the equitable adjustment unilaterally.
                (o) The Contractor shall not be entitled to any proposal preparation costs incurred subsequent to the date of a unilateral determination or denial of the request if the Contracting Officer issues a unilateral determination or denial under any of the following circumstances:
                (1) The Contractor fails to submit a proposal within the time required by this contract or such time as may reasonably be required by the Contracting Officer.
                (2) The Contractor fails to submit additional information requested by the Contracting Officer within the time reasonably required.
                (3) Agreement to an equitable adjustment cannot be reached within 60 days of submission of the Contractor's proposal or receipt of additional requested information, despite the Contracting Officer's diligent efforts to negotiate the equitable adjustment.

When the manufacturing plant is located outside of the United States, the Contractor shall arrange delivery of the items from a plant or warehouse located in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) equipped to perform all inspections and tests required by the contract or specifications to evidence conformance therewith, or shall arrange with a testing laboratory or other facility in the United States, acceptable to the Government, to perform the required inspections and tests.
                (2) In addition to the requirements in Federal Standard 368, ISO 9001:2000 or as otherwise approved by the Government, records shall include the date inspection and testing were performed. These records shall be available for (i) 3 years after final payment; or (ii) 4 years from the end of the Contractor's fiscal year in which the record was created, whichever period expires first.
                (3) Offerors are required to specify, in the space provided elsewhere in this solicitation, the name and address of each manufacturing plant or other facility where supplies will be available for inspection, indicating the item number(s) to which each applies.
                (4) The Contractor shall provide the Administrative Contracting Officer ACO with the name(s) of the individual and an alternate responsible for the inspection system. In the event that the designated individual(s) becomes unavailable to oversee the inspection system, the Contractor, within 10 calendar days of such event, shall provide the ACO with the names of the replacement individual(s).
                (b) Inspection by the Contractor. The Contractor is required to demonstrate that the supplies in the shipment have been subject to and have passed all inspections and tests required by the contract and meet the requirements of the contract.
                (c) Inspection by Government personnel. (1) Although the Government will normally rely upon the Contractor's representation as to the quality of supplies shipped, it reserves the right under the Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price clause to inspect and test all supplies called for by this contract, before acceptance, at all times and places, including the point of manufacture. When the Government notifies the Contractor of its intent to inspect supplies before shipment, the Contractor shall notify or arrange for subcontractors to notify the designated GSA quality assurance office 7 workdays before the date when supplies will be ready for inspection. Shipment shall not be made until inspection by the Government is completed and shipment is authorized by the Government.
                
                (2) The offeror shall indicate, in the spaces provided below, the location(s) at which the supplies will be inspected or made available for inspection.

                (3) During the contract period, a Government representative may periodically select samples of supplies produced under this contract for Government verification, inspection, and testing. Samples selected for testing will be disposed of as follows: Samples from an accepted lot, not damaged in the testing process, will be returned promptly to the Contractor after completion of tests. Samples damaged in the testing process will be disposed of as requested by the Contractor. Samples from a rejected lot will be returned to the Contractor or disposed of in a time and manner agreeable to both the Contractor and the Government.
                (d) Quality deficiencies. (1) Notwithstanding any other clause of this contract concerning the conclusiveness of acceptance by the Government, any supplies or production lots shipped under this contract found to be defective in material or workmanship, or otherwise not in conformity with the requirements of this contract within a period of ____*____ months after acceptance shall, at the Government's option, be replaced, repaired, or otherwise corrected by the Contractor at no cost to the Government within 30 calendar days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice to replace or correct. The Contractor shall remove, at its own expense, supplies rejected or required to be replaced, repaired, or corrected. When the nature of the defect affects an entire batch or lot of supplies, and the Contracting Officer determines that correction can best be accomplished by retaining the nonconforming supplies, and reducing the contract price by an equitable amount under the circumstances, then the equitable price adjustment shall apply to the entire batch or lot of supplies from which the nonconforming item was taken.
                (2) The Contractor may be issued a Quality Deficiency Notice (QDN) if:
                (i) Supplies in process, shipped, or awaiting shipment to fill Government orders are found not to comply with contract requirements, or (ii) deficiencies in either plant quality or process controls are found. Upon receipt of a QDN, the Contractor shall take immediate corrective action and shall suspend shipment of the supplies covered by the QDN until such time as corrective action has been completed. The Contractor shall notify the Government representative, within 5 workdays, of the action plan or the corrective action taken. The Government may elect to verify the corrective action at the Contractor location(s). Shipments of nonconforming supplies will be returned at the Contractor's expense and may constitute cause for termination of the contract. Delays due to the insurance of a QDN do not constitute excusable delay under the default clause of this contract. Failure to complete corrective action in a timely manner may result in termination of the contract.
                (3) This contract may be terminated for default if subsequent Government inspection discloses that plant quality or process controls are not being maintained, supplies that do not meet the requirements of the contract are being shipped, or if the contractor fails to comply with any other requirement of this clause.
                (e) Additional cost for inspection and testing. The Contractor shall be charged for any additional cost of inspection/testing or reinspecting/retesting supplies for the reasons stated in paragraph (e) of FAR 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price. When inspection or testing is performed by or under the direction of GSA, charges will be at the rate of $____**____ per man-hour or fraction thereof if the inspection is at a GSA distribution center; $____**____ per man-hour or fraction thereof, plus travel costs incurred, if the inspection is at any other location; and $____**____ per man-hour or fraction thereof for laboratory testing, except that when a testing facility other than a GSA laboratory performs all or part of the required tests, the Contractor shall be assessed the actual cost incurred by the Government as a result of testing at such facility. When inspection is performed by or under the direction of any agency other than GSA, the charges indicated above may be used, or the agency may assess the actual cost of performing the inspection and testing.
                
                (f) Responsibility for rejected supplies. When the Contractor fails to remove or provide instructions for the removal of rejected supplies under paragraph (d) of this clause, pursuant to the Contracting Officer's instructions, the Contractor shall be liable for all costs incurred by the Government in taking such measures as are expedient to avoid unnecessary loss to the Contractor. In addition to the remedies provided in FAR 52.246-2, supplies may be—
                (1) Stored and charged against the Contractor's account;
                (2) Reshipped to the Contractor at its expense (any additional expense incurred by the Government or the freight carrier caused by the refusal of the Contractor to accept their return shall also be charged against the Contractor's account);
                (3) Sold to the highest bidder on the open market and the proceeds applied against the accumulated storage and other costs, including the cost of the sale; or
                (4) Otherwise disposed of by the Government.
                (g) Subcontracting requirements. The Contractor shall insert in any subcontracts the inspection or testing provisions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause and the Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price clause of this contract. The Contractor shall be responsible for compliance by any subcontractor with the provisions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this clause and the Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price clause.

                “Discussions” are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.
                “In writing, writing or written” means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information.
                “Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.
                “Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result or of negotiations.
                “Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.
                (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).
                (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals. (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages. Offers must be:
                (i) Submitted on the forms prescribed and furnished by the Government as a part of this solicitation or on copies of those forms, and
                (ii) Signed. The person signing an offer must initial each erasure or change appearing on any offer form. If the offeror is a partnership, the names of the partners composing the firm must be included with the offer.
                (2) Late proposals and revisions. (i) The Government will not consider any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers unless it is received before the Government makes award and it meets at least one of the following conditions:
                (A) It was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of offers (e.g., an offer submitted in response to solicitation requiring receipt of offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th).
                (B) It was sent by mail (or telegram or facsimile, if authorized) or hand-carried (including delivery by a commercial carrier) if it is determined by the Government that the late receipt was due primarily to Government mishandling after receipt at the Government installation.
                (C) It was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term “working days” excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.

                (E) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the activity designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers, and that the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the procurement.
                (F) It is the only proposal received.
                (ii) Any modification or revision of a proposal or response to request for information, including any final proposal revision, is subject to the same conditions as in subparagraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (c)(2)(i)(E) of this provision.
                (iii) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal or modification or revision sent either by registered or certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal, response to a request for information, or modification or revision shall be processed as if mailed late. “Postmark” means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, offerors or respondents should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
                (iv) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
                (v) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late offer, modification or revision, or withdrawal sent by Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the “Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee” label and the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service, “Postmark” has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service. Therefore, offerors or respondents should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.
                (vi) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this provision, a late modification or revision of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

                (vii) An offeror may withdraw its proposal by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, an offeror may withdraw its proposal via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision entitled “Facsimile Proposals.” Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative's identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
                (viii) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office.
                (3) Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning this solicitation will be furnished promptly to all other prospective offerors, if that information is necessary in submitting offers or if the lack of it would be prejudicial to any other prospective offeror.
                (4) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.
                (5) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.
                (6) The Government will construe an offer to be in full and complete with this solicitation unless the offer describes any deviation in the offer.
                (7) Offerors may submit proposals that depart from stated requirements. Such a proposal shall clearly identify why the acceptance of the proposal would be advantageous to the Government. The proposal must clearly identify and explicitly define any deviations from the terms and conditions of the solicitation, as well as the comparative advantage to the Government. The Government reserves the right to amend the solicitation to allow all offerors an opportunity to submit revised proposals based on the revised requirements.
                (d) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. An offeror that includes in its proposal data that it does not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or use by the Government except for evaluation purposes, must meet both of the following conditions:
                (1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
                This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed—in whole or in part—for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a lease is awarded to this offeror as a result of—or in connection with—the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets].
                (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
                Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
                (e) Lease award. (1) The Government intends to award a lease resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
                (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest.
                (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
                (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a lease after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.
                (5) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
                (6) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the price proposed are materially unbalanced between line terms or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understand as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
                (7) The execution and delivery of the Lease contract by the Government establishes a valid award and contract.
                (8) The Government may disclose the following information in postaward debriefings to other offerors:

                (i) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful offeror;
                
                (ii) The overall making of all offerors, when any making was developed by the agency during source selection; and
                (iii) A summary of the rationale for award.
              
              (f) Paperwork collection. The information collection requirements contained in this solicitation/contract are either required by regulation or approved by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB Control No. 3090-0163.

                Alternate II (MAR 1998). As prescribed in 570.702, substitute the following paragraph for paragraph (e)(4) of the basic provision:
              
              
                (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a lease without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

              Historic Preference.
              As prescribed in 570.702, insert the following provision:
              
                Historic Preference (SEP 2004)
                (a) The Government will give preference to offers of space in historic properties following this hierarchy of consideration:
                (1) Historic properties within historic districts.
                (2) Non-historic developed and non-historic undeveloped sites within historic districts.
                (3) Historic properties outside of historic districts.
                (b) Definitions. (1) Determination of eligibility means a decision by the Department of the Interior that a district, site, building, structure or object meets the National Register criteria for evaluation although the property is not formally listed in the National Register (36 CFR 60.3(c)).
                (2) Historic district means a geographically definable area, urban or rural, possessing a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical development. A district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history (36 CFR 60.3(d)). The historic district must be included in or be determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
                (3) Historic property means any pre-historic or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in or been determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior (36 CFR 800.16(l)).
                (4) National Register of Historic Places means the National Register of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering and culture that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to expand and maintain under the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 60.1).
                (c) The offer of space must meet the terms and conditions of this solicitation. The Contracting Officer has discretion to accept alternatives to certain architectural characteristics and safety features defined elsewhere in this solicitation to maintain the historical integrity of an historic building, such as high ceilings and wooden floors, or to maintain the integrity of an historic district, such as setbacks, floor-to-ceiling heights, and location and appearance of parking.
                (d) When award will be based on the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process, the Government will give a price evaluation preference, based on the total annual square foot (ANSI/BOMA Office Area) cost to the Government, to historic properties as follows:
                (1) First to suitable historic properties within historic districts, a 10 percent price preference.

                (2) If no suitable historic property within an historic district is offered, or the 10 percent preference does not result in such property being the lowest price technically acceptable offer, the Government will give a 2.5 percent price preference to suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts.
                
                (3) If no suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped site within an historic district is offered, or the 2.5 percent preference does not result in such property being the lowest price technically acceptable offer, the Government will give a 10 percent price preference to suitable historic properties outside of historic districts.
                (4) Finally, if no suitable historic property outside of historic districts is offered, no historic price preference will be given to any property offered.
                (e) When award will be based on the best value tradeoff source selection process, which permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors, the Government will give a price evaluation preference, based on the total annual square foot (ANSI/BOMA Office Area) cost to the Government, to historic properties as follows:
                (1) First to suitable historic properties within historic districts, a 10 percent price preference.
                (2) If no suitable historic property within a historic district is offered or remains in the competition, the Government will give a 2.5 percent price preference to suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts.
                (3) If no suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped site within an historic district is offered or remains in the competition, the Government will give a 10 percent price preference to suitable historic properties outside of historic districts.
                (4) Finally, if no suitable historic property outside of historic districts is offered, no historic price preference will be given to any property offered.
                (f) The Government will compute price evaluation preferences by reducing the price(s) of the offerors qualifying for a price evaluation preference by the applicable percentage provided in this provision. The price evaluation preference will be used for price evaluation purposes only. The Government will award a contract in the amount of the actual price(s) proposed by the successful offeror and accepted by the Government.
                (g) To qualify for a price evaluation preference, offerors must provide satisfactory documentation in their offer that their property qualifies as one of the following:
                (1) An historic property within an historic district.
                (2) A non-historic developed or undeveloped site within an historic district.
                (3) An historic property outside of an historic district.

                (a) At any time and from time to time after receipt of an offer (until the same has been duly withdrawn or rejected), after acceptance thereof and during the term, the agents, employees and contractors of the Government may, upon reasonable prior notice to Offeror or Lessor, enter upon the offered premises or the premises, and all other areas of the building access to which is necessary to accomplish the purposes of entry, to determine the potential or actual compliance by the Offeror or Lessor with the requirements of the solicitation or this lease, which purposes shall include, but not be limited to:
                (1) Inspecting, sampling and analyzing suspected asbestos-containing materials and air monitoring for asbestos fibers;
                (2) Inspecting the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, maintenance records, and mechanical rooms for the offered premises or the premises;
                (3) Inspecting for any leaks, spills, or other potentially hazardous conditions which may involve tenant exposure to hazardous or toxic substances; and
                (4) Inspecting for any current or past hazardous waste operations, to ensure that appropriate mitigative actions were taken to alleviate any environmentally unsound activities in accordance with Federal, State and local law.
                (b) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to create a Government duty to inspect for toxic materials or to impose a higher standard of care on the Government than on other lessees. The purpose of this clause is to promote the ease with which the Government may inspect the building. Nothing in this clause shall act to relieve the Lessor of any duty to inspect or liability which might arise as a result of Lessor's failure to inspect for or correct a hazardous condition.

                Failure in Performance (SEP 1999)

                The covenant to pay rent and the covenant to provide any service, utility, maintenance, or repair required under this lease are interdependent. In the event of any failure by the Lessor to provide any service, utility, maintenance, repair or replacement required under this lease the Government may, by contract or otherwise, perform the requirement and deduct from any payment or payments under this lease, then or thereafter due, the resulting cost to the Government, including all administrative costs. If the Government elects to perform any such requirement, the Government and each of its contractors shall be entitled to access to any and all areas of the building, access to which is necessary to perform any such requirement, and the Lessor shall afford and facilitate such access. Alternatively, the Government may deduct from any payment under this lease, then or thereafter due, an amount which reflects the reduced value of the contract requirement not performed. No deduction from rent pursuant to this clause shall constitute a default by the Government under this lease. These remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to any other remedies which may be available under this lease or at law.

                (d) The Government shall not terminate this lease under this clause nor charge the Lessor with damages under this clause, if (1) the delay in substantially completing the work arises from excusable delays, and (2) the Lessor within 10 days from the beginning of any such delay (unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer) provides notice to the Contracting Officer of the causes of delay. The Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of delay. If the facts warrant, the Contracting Officer shall extend the delivery date, to the extent of such delay at no additional costs to the Government.

                (c) If the amount of ABOA square footage delivered is less than the amount agreed to in the lease, the lease will be modified to reflect the amount of ABOA space delivered and the annual rental will be adjusted as follows:

                (a) Lessor warrants that it holds such title to or other interest in the premises and other property as is necessary to the Government's access to the premises and full use and enjoyment thereof in accordance with the provisions of this lease. Government agrees, in consideration of the warranties and conditions set forth in this clause, that this lease is subject and subordinate to any and all recorded mortgages, deeds of trust and other liens now or hereafter existing or imposed upon the premises, and to any renewal, modification or extension thereof. It is the intention of the parties that this provision shall be self-operative and that no further instrument shall be required to effect the present or subsequent subordination of this lease. Government agrees, however, within twenty (20) business days next following the Contracting Officer's receipt of a written demand, to execute such instruments as Lessor may reasonably request to evidence further the subordination of this lease to any existing or future mortgage, deed of trust or other security interest pertaining to the premises, and to any water, sewer or access easement necessary or desirable to serve the premises or adjoining property owned in whole or in part by Lessor if such easement does not interfere with the full enjoyment of any right granted the Government under this lease.

                (b) No such subordination, to either existing or future mortgages, deeds of trust or other lien or security instrument shall operate to affect adversely any right of the Government under this lease so long as the Government is not in default under this lease. Lessor will include in any future mortgage, deed of trust or other security instrument to which this lease becomes subordinate, or in a separate nondisturbance agreement, a provision to the foregoing effect.

                Price Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity (JUN 2011)
                (a) If the head of the contracting activity (HCA) or his or her designee determines that there was a violation of subsection 27(a) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 423), as implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Government, at its election, may—
                (1) Reduce the monthly rental under this lease by five percent of the amount of the rental for each month of the remaining term of the lease, including any option periods, and recover five percent of the rental already paid;

                (3) Reduce the payments for violations by a Lessor's subcontractor by an amount not to exceed the amount of profit or fee reflected in the subcontract at the time the subcontract was placed.
                (b) Prior to making a determination as set forth above, the HCA or designee shall provide to the Lessor a written notice of the action being considered and the basis thereof. The Lessor shall have a period determined by the agency head or designee, but not less than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice, to submit in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the proposed reduction. The agency head or designee may, upon good cause shown, determine to deduct less than the above amounts from payments.

                Prompt Payment (JUN 2011)
                The Government will make payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. Payment shall be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or an electronic funds transfer is made. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified.
                (a) Payment due date—(1) Rental payments. Rent shall be paid monthly in arrears and will be due on the first workday of each month, and only as provided for by the lease.
                (i) When the date for commencement of rent falls on the 15th day of the month or earlier, the initial monthly rental payment under this contract shall become due on the first workday of the month following the month in which the commencement of the rent is effective.

                (ii) When the date for commencement of rent falls after the 15th day of the month, the initial monthly rental payment under this contract shall become due on the first workday of the second month following the month in which the commencement of the rent is effective.
                (2) Other payments. The due date for making payments other than rent shall be the later of the following two events:
                (i) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the Contractor.
                (ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or service. However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be deemed to be the 30th day after the Contractor's invoice is dated, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.
                (b) Invoice and inspection requirements for payments other than rent. (1) The Contractor shall prepare and submit an invoice to the designated billing office after completion of the work. A proper invoice shall include the following items:
                (i) Name and address of the Contractor.
                (ii) Invoice date.
                (iii) Lease number.
                (iv) Government's order number or other authorization.
                (v) Description, price, and quantity of work or services delivered.
                (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the remittance address in the lease or the order).
                (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.
                (2) The Government will inspect and determine the acceptability of the work performed or services delivered within seven days after the receipt of a proper invoice or notification of completion of the work or services unless a different period is specified at the time the order is placed. If actual acceptance occurs later, for the purpose of determining the payment due date and calculation of interest, acceptance will be deemed to occur on the last day of the seven day inspection period. If the work or service is rejected for failure to conform to the technical requirements of the contract, the seven days will be counted beginning with receipt of a new invoice or notification. In either case, the Contractor is not entitled to any payment or interest unless actual acceptance by the Government occurs.
                (c) Interest Penalty. (1) An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the Government, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date.

                (2) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date. This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and it is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the payment amount approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment date.
                (3) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes, or for more than one year. Interest penalties of less than $1.00 need not be paid.
                (4) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes.
                (d) Overpayments. If the Lessor becomes aware of a duplicate payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a payment, the Contractor shall—
                (1) Return the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the—
                (i) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);
                (ii) Affected lease number;
                (iii) Affected lease line item or subline item, if applicable; and
                (iv) Lessor point of contact.
                (2) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.

For breach or violation of this warranty, the Government shall have the right to annul this contract without liability or, in its discretion, to deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise recover the full amount of the contingent fee.
                (b) Bona fide agency, as used in this clause, means an established commercial or selling agency (including licensed real estate agents or brokers), maintained by a Contractor for the purpose of securing business, that neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government contracts nor holds itself out as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.
                
                  Bona fide employee, as used in this clause, means a person, employed by a Contractor and subject to the Contractor's supervision and control as to time, place, and manner of performance, who neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government contracts nor holds out as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.
                
                  Contingent fee, as used in this clause, means any commission, percentage, brokerage, or other fee that is contingent upon the success that a person or concern has in securing a Government contract.
                
                  Improper influence, as used in this clause, means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Government employee or officer to give consideration or to act regarding a Government contract on any basis other than the merits of the matter.

              (d) The FAR does not apply to leasehold acquisitions of real property. Where referenced in this part, FAR provisions have been adopted based on a statutory requirement applicable to such lease acquisitions or as a matter of policy, including, but not limited to “Federal agency procurement” as defined at FAR 3.104.

              Definitions.
              
                ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) means the area “where a tenant normally houses personnel, and/or furniture, for which a measurement is to be computed,” as stated by the American National Standards Institute/Building Owners and Managers Association (ANSI/BOMA) publication, Z65.1-1996.
              
                Contract means lease.
              
                Contractor means lessor.
              
                Landlord or lessor means any individual, firm, partnership, trust, association, State or local government, or other legal entity that leases real property to the Government.
              
                Lease or leasehold interest in real property means a conveyance to the Government of the right of exclusive possession of real property for a definite period of time by a landlord. It may include operational services provided by the landlord.
              
                Lease acquisition means the acquiring by lease of an interest in improved real property for use by the Government, whether the space already exists or must be constructed.
              
                Lease extension means extension of the expiration date of a lease to provide for continued occupancy on a short term basis.
              
                Lease renewal (option) means the right, but not the obligation of the Government to continue a lease upon specified terms and conditions, including lease term and rent.
              
                Lessee or tenant means the United States of America.
              
                Operational services means services that support use of a leased property, such as heating, ventilation, air condition, utilities, and custodial services.
              
                Simplified lease acquisition procedures mean the procedures for awarding leases at or below the simplified lease acquisition threshold.
              
                Simplified lease acquisition threshold means the simplified acquisition threshold (see FAR 2.101), when applied to the average annual amount of rent for the term of the lease, including option periods and excluding the cost of services.
              
                Small business means a concern including affiliates, which is organized for profit, is independently-owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of leasing commercial real estate, and that has annual average gross receipts for the preceding three fiscal years which are less than the size standard established by the Small Business Administration pursuant to 13 CFR Part 121. The size standards may be found at https://www.sba.gov/content/small-business-size-standards. For most lease procurements, the NAICS code is 531190.
              
                Solicitation for Offers (SFO) means a request for proposals.
              
                Substantially as follows or substantially the same as, when used in prescribing a provision or clause, means that the contracting officer may prepare and use a variation of that provision or clause to accommodate requirements peculiar to an individual acquisition. The variation must include the salient features of the FAR or GSAR provision or clause. It must also be consistent with the intent, principle, and substance of the FAR or GSAR provision or clause and related coverage on the subject matter.
              
              
                Succeeding lease means a lease whose effective date immediately follows the expiration date of an existing lease for space in the same building.
              
                Superseding lease means a lease that replaces an existing lease, prior to the scheduled expiration of the existing lease term.

              (a) The Administrator of General Services is authorized by 40 U.S.C. § 585 to enter into a lease agreement for the accommodation of a Federal agency in a building (or improvement) which is in existence or being erected by the lessor for the accommodation of the Federal agency. The lease agreement may not bind the Government for more than 20 years.
              (b) The contracting officer has exclusive authority to enter into and administer leases on the Government's behalf to the extent provided in the certificate of appointment as a contracting officer. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit the contracting officer's authority to designate, consistent with statute and regulation, a contracting officer's representative.

              Competition.
              Unless the contracting officer uses the simplified procedures in subpart 570.2, the competition requirements of FAR part 6 apply to acquisition of leasehold interests in real property.

              Contracting by negotiation.
              Contracting by negotiation is appropriate for acquiring space in a building through a lease contract. The contracting officer will usually need to conduct discussions with offerors about their proposals and consider factors other than price in making the award.

              Criteria for the use of two-phase design-build.
              The contracting officer may use the two-phase design-build selection procedures in 41 U.S.C. 253m for lease construction projects. This includes lease construction projects with options to purchase the real property leased. Use the procedures in 41 U.S.C. 253m and FAR 36.3 when the conditions in (a) and (b) below are met:
              (a) The contracting officer anticipates that the lease will involve the design and construction of a building, facility, or work for lease to the Government.
              (b) The contracting officer determines whether the procedures are appropriate for entering into a lease construction contract based on the following:
              (1) The contracting officer expects to receive three or more offers.
              (2) Offerors will need to perform design work before developing a price.
              (3) Offerors will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing offers.
              (4) The contracting officer considers criteria such as the following:
              (i) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.
              (ii) The time constraints for delivery of the project.
              (iii) The capability and experience of potential contractors.
              (iv) The past performance of potential contractors.
              (v) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.
              (vi) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.
              (vii) Other criteria established by the HCA.
              (c) See 570.305 for additional information.

              570.106
              Advertising, publicizing, and notifications to Congress.

              (a) If a proposed acquisition is not exempt under FAR 5.202 or GSAR 570.106(e), and is for a leasehold interest in real property estimated to exceed 10,000 square feet, then the contracting officer must publicize the proposed acquisition in http://www.FBO.gov.
              

              (b) For leasehold acquisitions where the solicitation requires the construction of a new building on a preselected site, the contracting officer, in accordance with the timeframes established in FAR 5.203, must publicize the proposed acquisition in http://www.FBO.gov regardless of size or value.

              (c) For leasehold acquisitions not subject to a square foot measurement (e.g., antennas, piers, parking), contracting officers must publicize the proposed acquisition in http://www.FBO.gov when the contract action is expected to exceed $25,000, unless an exception under FAR 5.202 applies.

              (d) Other than as identified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the contracting officer need not publicize the proposed acquisition of a leasehold interest in real property, including expansion requests within the scope of a lease (see 570.403), lease extensions under the conditions defined in 570.405, and building alterations within the scope of a lease (see 570.5). However, the contracting officer may publicize proposed lease acquisitions of any dollar value or square footage in http://www.FBO.gov or local newspapers if, in the opinion of the contracting officer, doing so is necessary to promote competition.
              (e) The contracting officer may issue a consolidated advertisement for multiple leasing actions.

              (f) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where publicizing of the proposed acquisition is required, the notice shall be published in http://www.FBO.gov not less than three calendar days prior to issuance of a solicitation.
              (g) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and as set forth in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, the contracting officer shall provide offerors not less than 20 calendar days between solicitation issuance and the date established for receipt of initial offers.
              (1) For a proposed acquisition using simplified lease acquisition procedures (see 570.2), consider the individual acquisition and establish a reasonable response time.
              (2) In cases of unusual and compelling urgency (FAR 6.303-2), provide as much time as reasonably possible under the circumstances and document the contract file.
              (h) If a Member of Congress has specifically requested notification of award, the contracting officer must provide award notifications in accordance with 505.303.

              Synopsis of lease awards.

              (a) Except for lease actions described in paragraph (b) of this section, contracting officers must synopsize in http://www.FBO.gov awards exceeding $25,000 total contract value that are likely to result in the award of any subcontracts. However, the dollar threshold is not a prohibition against publicizing an award of a smaller amount when publicizing would be advantageous to industry or to the Government.
              (b) A notice is not required if—
              (1) The notice would disclose the occupant agency's needs and the disclosure of such needs would compromise the national security; or
              (2) The lease—
              (i) Is for an amount not greater than the simplified lease acquisition threshold;

              (ii) Was made through a means where access to the notice of proposed lease action was provided through http://www.FBO.gov; and
              (iii) Permitted the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.

              (c) Justifications for other than full and open competition must be posted in http://www.FBO.gov. Information exempt from public disclosure must be redacted.

              (a) Determine that the prospective awardee is responsible with respect to the lease under consideration. The standards in FAR 9.104 apply. As part of the determination that a prospective contractor is otherwise qualified and eligible for award, review exclusions in the System for Award Management (SAM).
              (b) The contracting officer's signature on the contract is deemed an affirmative determination.
              (c) If the contracting officer finds an offeror nonresponsible, sign and place in the contract file a determination of nonresponsibility. State the basis for the determination.
              (d) If the contracting officer finds a small business concern nonresponsible, the procedures at FAR 19.6 apply. Place all documents and reports supporting a determination of responsibility or nonresponsibility in the lease file.

              (b) FAR 15.403-1 defines exceptions to and waivers for submitting cost or pricing data. Most leasing actions will have adequate price competition. For price analysis of offered rental rates, the contracting officer may use a market survey, an appraisal conducted using accepted real property appraisal procedures to establish a market price for comparison, or other relevant market research data. For price analysis of offered tenant improvement costs, obtain two offers or cost and pricing data.
              (c) In exceptional cases, the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data may be waived under FAR 15.403-1(c)(4).
              (d) If cost or pricing data are required, follow the procedures in FAR 15.403-4 and 15.406-2.

              Before accepting the space, the contracting officer must verify that the space complies with the Government's requirements and specifications and document this in an inspection report. The inspection and acceptance document must contain the square footage accepted and the acceptance date. Include the inspection and acceptance in the contract file. When space such as piers, antennas, and parking are leased, square footage may not be the manner in which the amount of space is specified; therefore, document that the space complies with the Government's written requirements.

              570.201
              Purpose.
              This subpart prescribes simplified procedures for small leases. These procedures reduce administrative costs, while improving efficiency and economy, when acquiring small leasehold interests in real property.
            
            
              570.202
              Policy.
              Use simplified lease acquisition procedures to the maximum extent practicable for actions at or below the simplified lease acquisition threshold.

              570.203-2
              Competition.
              (a) To the maximum extent practicable, the contracting officer must solicit at least three sources to promote competition. If there are repeated requirements for space in the same market, invite two sources, if practicable, that are not included in the most recent solicitation to submit offers.
              (b) If the contracting officer solicits only one source, document the file to explain the lack of competition.

              Soliciting offers.
              (a) The contracting officer must solicit offers by providing each prospective offeror a proposed short form lease GSA Form 3626 or SFO. The short form lease or SFO must:
              (1) Describe the Government's requirements.
              (2) List all award factors, including price or cost, and any significant subfactors that the contracting officer will consider in awarding the lease.

              (3) State the relative importance of the evaluation factors and subfactors.
              
              (4) State whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are either:
              (i) Significantly more important than cost or price.
              (ii) Approximately equal in importance to cost or price.
              (iii) Significantly less important than cost or price.
              (5) Include either in full text or by reference, applicable FAR provisions and contract clauses required by 570.6.
              (6) Include sustainable design requirements.
              (b) As necessary, review with prospective offerors the Government's requirements, pricing matters, evaluation procedures and submission of offers.

              Negotiation, evaluation, and award.
              (a) If the contracting officer needs to conduct negotiations, use the procedures in 570.307.
              (b) Evaluate offers in accordance with the solicitation. Evaluate prices and document the lease file to demonstrate whether the proposed contract prices are fair and reasonable. See 570.110.
              (c) If the total price, including options, exceeds the amount established by FAR 15.403-4, consider whether the contracting officer needs cost and pricing data to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. In most cases, the exceptions at FAR 15.403-1 will apply.
              (d) Regardless of the process used, the contracting officer must determine whether the price is fair and reasonable.
              (e) If the total contract value of the lease, including options, will exceed the amount established by FAR 19.702(a), the proposed awardee must provide an acceptable small business subcontracting plan. This requirement does not apply if the proposed awardee is a small business concern.
              (f) Make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government considering price and other factors included in the solicitation.

              (a) If a succeeding lease for the continued occupancy of space in a building does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use the simplified procedures in 570.2. Explain the absence of competition in the contract file.
              (b) If a succeeding lease will exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may enter into the lease under either of the following conditions:
              (1) The contracting officer does not identify any potential acceptable locations.
              (2) The contracting officer identifies potential acceptable locations, but a cost-benefit analysis indicates that award to an offeror other than the present lessor will result in substantial relocation costs or duplication of costs to the Government, and the Government cannot expect to recover such costs through competition.

              570.402-2
              Publicizing/Advertising.
              The contracting officer must publish a notice if required by 570.106. The notice should:
              (a) Indicate that the Government's lease is expiring.
              (b) Describe the requirements in terms of type and quantity of space.
              (c) Indicate that the Government is interested in considering alternative space if economically advantageous, and that otherwise the Government intends to pursue a sole source acquisition.
              (d) Advise prospective offerors that the Government will consider the cost of moving, alterations, etc., when deciding whether it should relocate.
              (e) Provide a contact person for those interested in providing space to the Government.

              No potential acceptable locations.

              If the contracting officer does not identify any potential acceptable locations through the advertisement or the market survey, prepare a written justification to negotiate directly with the present lessor. Fully document the efforts to locate alternative sources. Prepare the justification and obtain approval following FAR 6.3 and 506.3.

              Potential acceptable locations.
              If the contracting officer identifies potential acceptable locations through the advertisement or market survey, conduct a cost-benefit analysis following the procedures in 570.402-6. Based on the results of the cost-benefit analysis, take appropriate action as follows:
              (a) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government will recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition, develop an SFO and negotiate with all interested parties following 570.3.
              (b) If the cost-benefit analysis indicates that the Government cannot expect to recover relocation costs and duplication of costs through competition, prepare a justification for approval in accordance with FAR 6.3 and 506.3. Explain both:
              (1) How the contracting officer performed the cost-benefit analysis.
              (2) That the cost-benefit analysis indicates that award to any other offeror will likely result in substantial costs to the Government that the Government cannot expect to recover through competition.

              570.402-6
              Cost-benefit analysis.
              (a) The cost-benefit analysis must consider all the following:
              (1) The prices of other potentially available properties.
              (2) Relocation costs, including estimated costs for moving, telecommunications, and alterations, amortized over the firm term of the lease.
              (3) Duplication of costs to the Government.
              (4) Other appropriate considerations.
              (b) Establish the prices for other potentially available properties by requesting each prospective offeror to provide an informational quotation for standard space for comparison purposes.
              (1) Adjust the prices quoted for standard space for any special requirements.
              (2) You do not need a formal SFO to obtain the informational quotation. However, you must provide a general description of the Government's needs.
              (3) If you obtain oral quotations, document the following information, as a minimum:
              (i) Name and address of the firm solicited.
              (ii) Name of the firm's representative providing the quote.
              (iii) Price(s) quoted.
              (iv) Description of the space and services for which the quote is provided.
              (v) Name of the Government employee soliciting the quotation.
              (vi) Date of the conversation.
              (4) Compare the informational quotations to the present lessor's price, adjusted to reflect the anticipated price for a succeeding lease.

              Expansion requests.
              (a) If the expansion space is in the general scope of the lease, the contracting officer may acquire the space through a modification without further justification under FAR 6.3.
              (b) If the expansion space needed is outside the general scope of the lease, the contracting officer must determine whether it is more prudent to provide the expansion space by supplemental agreement to the existing lease or to meet the expansion requirement and existing tenancy to the requirement by competitive means.
              (1) Conduct a market survey to determine the availability of suitable alternative locations.
              (2) If you identify alternate locations that can satisfy the total requirement, perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether it is in the Government's best interest to relocate. Consider, as appropriate.
              (i) The cost of the alternate space compared to the cost of expanding at the existing location.
              (ii) The cost of moving.
              (iii) The cost of duplicating existing improvements.

              (iv) The cost of the unexpired portion of the firm lease term. If a termination is possible, use the actual cost of such an action.
              
              (v) the cost of disruption to the agency's operation.
              (c) If the contracting officer determines not to use competitive procedures and the expansion space is outside the general scope of the lease:
              (1) If the estimated value of the acquisition does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, document the file as required by 570.203-2(b).
              (2) If the estimated value of the acquisition exceeds the simplified lease acquisition threshold, prepare a justification for approval under FAR 6.3 and 506.3.

              Superseding leases.
              (a) Consider executing a superseding lease to replace an existing lease when the Government need numerous or detailed modifications to the space that would cause complications or substantially change the present lease or when market conditions warrant renegotiation of an existing lease.
              (b) If the value of the superseding lease exceeds the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. If the cost does not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use the simplified procedures in 570.2 and explain the absence of competition in the file.

              (a) This section applies to extension of the term of a lease to provide for continued occupancy on a short-term basis.
              (b) If the value of a lease extension will exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply. For extensions that will not exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use the simplified procedures in 570.2 and explain the absence of competition in the file.
              (c) FAR 6.302-1 permits contracting without providing for full and open competition when the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. This authority may apply to lease extensions in situations such as, but not limited to, the following:
              (1) The agency occupying the leased space is scheduled to move into other Federally controlled space, but encounters unexpected delays in preparing the new space for occupancy.
              (2) The Government encounters unexpected delays outside of its control in acquiring replacement space.
              (3) The Government is consolidating various agencies and the contracting officer needs to extend the terms of some leases to establish a common expiration date.
              (4) The agency occupying the space has encountered delays in planning for a potential relocation to other federally controlled space due to documented organizational, financial, or other uncertainties.

            Subpart 570.5—Special Aspects of Contracting for Lease Alterations
            
              570.501
              General.
              (a) The procedures in 570.502 apply to alterations acquired directly from a lessor by modification or supplemental lease agreement. This is allowed if the following conditions are met:
              (1) The alterations fall within the scope of the lease. Consider whether the work can be regarded fairly and reasonably as part of the original lease requirement.
              (2) The lessor is willing to perform the proposed alterations at a fair and reasonable price.
              (3) It is in the Government's interest to acquire the alterations from the lessor.
              (b) If proposed alterations are outside the scope of the existing lease, decide whether to acquire the alterations through either:
              (1) A supplemental lease agreement, as justified and approved under 570.502-1.

              (2) Government performance or a separate contract. The lease must first provide the Government the right to perform alterations to the leased space.

              Justification and approval requirements.
              If the proposed alterations are outside the general scope of the lease and the contracting officer plans to acquire them from the lessor without competition, the following justification and approval requirements apply:
              (a) If the alteration project will not exceed the micro-purchase threshold identified in FAR 2.101(b), no justification and approval is required.
              (b) If the alteration project will exceed the micro-purchase threshold identified in FAR 2.101(b), but not the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use simplified acquisition procedures and explain the absence of competition in the file.
              (c) If the alteration project will exceed the simplified lease acquisition threshold, the justification and approval requirements in FAR 6.3 and 506.3 apply.

              Procedures.
              (a) Scope of work. The contracting officer must prepare a scope of work for each alteration project.
              (b) Independent Government estimate. The contracting officer must obtain an independent Government estimate for each alteration project, including changes to existing alteration agreements with the lessor.
              (c) Request for proposal. (1) The contracting officer must provide the scope of work to the lessor, including any plans and specifications, and request a proposal.
              (2) The contracting officer must request sufficient cost or price information to permit a price analysis.
              (d) Audits. If the contracting officer requires cost or pricing data and the alteration project will exceed the threshold identified in FAR 15.403-4, request an audit.
              (e) Proposal evaluation. The contracting officer must—
              (1) Determine if the proposal meets the Government's requirements.
              (2) Analyze price or cost information. At a minimum, compare the proposed cost to the independent estimate and, if applicable, any audit results received.
              (3) Analyze profit following FAR 15.404-4.
              (4) Document the analysis under this paragraph and the resulting negotiation objectives.
              (f) Price negotiations. The contracting officer must—
              (1) Exercise sound judgment. Make reasonable compromises as necessary.
              (2) Provide the lessor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.
              (3) Document negotiations in the contract file, including discussions regarding restoration cost or waiver of restoration cost.
              (g) Order. For modifications not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, lease contracting officers may delegate alteration contracting authority to a warranted contracting officer's representative in GSA or the tenant agency. Alterations awards must reference the lease number. If the modification does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, the contracting officer may use GSA Form 300, Order for Supplies or Services. Reference the lease on the form.
              (h) Inspection and payment. The contracting officer must not make final payment for alterations until the work is:
              (1) Inspected by a qualified Government employee or independent Government contractor.
              (2) Confirmed as completed in a satisfactory manner.

              570.503
              Alterations by the Government or through a separate contract.
              If the Government chooses to exercise its right to make the alterations rather than contracting directly with the lessor, the Government may either:
              (a) Have Federal employees perform the work.

              (b) Contract out the work using standard contracting procedures that apply to a construction contract performed on Federal property. If the Government decides to contract for the work, invite the lessor, as well as all other prospective contractors, to submit offers for the project.

              (a) Lease tenant agencies may need overtime services and utilities on a regular or intermittent basis. Lease contracting officers may negotiate overtime rates for services and utilities and include those rates in leases where a need is projected. Only lease contracting officers may negotiate overtime rates.
              (b) An independent government estimate is required in support of the negotiated rate.
              (c) Order. To order overtime services and utilities, if the order does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, a warranted contracting officer's representative, in GSA or the tenant agency, may place an order. The order must reference the lease number.
              (d) Payment. Do not make final payment for services and utilities until confirmed as delivered in a satisfactory manner.

              (c) Certain clauses required by non-GSA regulations require approval of the issuing agency before the contracting officer can delete or modify them. For example, FARs 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; and 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, require the approval of the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs before they can be deleted from or modified in the SFO or lease.

              OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

              The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget before collecting information from ten (10) or more members of the public. Individuals are not required to respond to information collection unless the OMB number and burden estimate information is provided. Accordingly, the information and recordkeeping requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by OMB under OMB Control Number 1405-0050. The information and recordkeeping requirements for Form DS-4053, Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program Application, have been approved by OMB under OMB Control Number 1405-0161.

              Policy.
              (a) The Assistant Secretary of State for Administration is the agency head for the purposes of FAR 1.301. The Assistant Secretary of State for Administration redelegated to the Procurement Executive the authority to prescribe, promulgate, and amend DOS acquisition policies, rules, and regulations.
              (b) The Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) is prescribed under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2658 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c).
              (c) The DOSAR implements and supplements the FAR.
              [59 FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994, as amended at 64 FR 43620, Aug. 11, 1999; 80 FR 6913, Feb. 9, 2015]
            
            
              601.302
              Limitations.

              (a) The FAR and the DOSAR apply to all DOS acquisitions of personal property and services, including construction, both within and outside the United States, unless expressly excluded by this subpart, or exempt from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 474(7)), or undertaken pursuant to section 208 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4308), or the Foreign Service Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 292 et seq.).
              (b) At posts where Joint Administrative Offices have been formed and DOS is the procurement agency, the FAR and DOSAR apply to all administrative and technical support acquisitions.
              [53 FR 26159, July 11, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 66751, Dec. 28, 1994; 64 FR 43620, Aug. 11, 1999; 80 FR 6913, Feb. 9, 2015]

              Publication and codification.
              (a) The DOSAR is issued as Chapter 6 of Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations. The DOSAR is established as Chapter 6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System. The DOSAR is divided into the same parts, subparts, sections, subsections, and paragraphs as is the FAR. However, when the FAR coverage is adequate by itself there will be no corresponding DOSAR coverage. Where the DOSAR implements a specific part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR, the DOSAR coverage is numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriate FAR number and title, except that the DOSAR number will include a 6 or 60 such that there will always be three numbers to the left of the decimal. For example, the DOSAR implementation of FAR 14.1 is shown as 614.1 and the DOSAR implementation of FAR 1.301 is shown as 601.301. Materials that supplement the FAR are assigned the numbers 70 and up. For example, DOSAR requires additional definitions than those used in FAR; this supplementary material is provided in 602.101-70.
              (b) The DOSAR and its revisions are published in the Federal Register and in the Code of Federal Regulations, both of which may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.
              (c) The DOSAR shall be referenced in the same manner as described at FAR 1.105-2(c).

              601.601-70
              Delegations of authority.
              (a) Delegations. As stated in 601.603-3(a), there is no contracting officer authority conferred by virtue of position. Pursuant to 601.602-1(b), the Procurement Executive has designated the following as contracting activities as defined in FAR 2.101. These authorities are not redelegable. In addition, specific individuals are designated as heads of contracting activities (HCAs) (see FAR 2.101):
              (1) Overseas posts. Each overseas post shall be regarded as a contracting activity to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services. The Principal Officer, the Management Officer, or the Supervisory General Services Officer are designated as HCAs; provided, that he/she has a contracting officer's warrant issued by the Procurement Executive. The Procurement Executive (or authorized A/OPE staff) may delegate to a contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, the authority to award a contract or modification which exceeds the contracting officer's warrant level.
              (i) No authority is delegated to enter into cost-reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redeterminable contracts. Design/build solicitations and contracts may only be entered into with the written approval of A/OPE and OBO. Proposed construction contracts exceeding $500,000 and any related architect-engineer contracts must have prior A/OPE approval.

              (ii) When expressly authorized by a U.S. Government agency which does not have a contracting officer at the post, the officers named in paragraph (a)(1) introductory text of this section may enter into contracts for that agency. Use of this authority is subject to the statutory authority of that agency and any special contract terms or other requirements necessary for compliance with any conditions or limitations applicable to the funds of that agency. The agency's authorization shall cite the statute(s) and state any special contract terms or other requirements with which the acquisition so authorized must comply. In view of the contracting officer's responsibility for the legal, technical, and administrative sufficiency of contracts, questions regarding the propriety of contracting actions that the post is required to take pursuant to this authority may be referred to the Department for resolution with the headquarters of the agency concerned.
              (2) Office of Logistics Management; Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM). The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies and services, including construction, is delegated to the Director or designee as the HCA.
              (3) Foreign Service Institute. The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to Chapter 7, Title I, of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4021 et seq.), is delegated to the Director of the Foreign Service Institute, the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, and the Supervisory Contracting Officer as the HCA.
              (4) Office of Foreign Missions. The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to Title II of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.), is delegated to the Director, Office of Foreign Missions, and the Administrative Officer as the HCA.
              (5) U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C.287), is delegated to the Counselor for Administration as the HCA.
              (b) Other delegations. Several DOS offices have been delegated limited procurement authority, although they have not been designated as HCAs. Matters requiring HCA resolution are referred to the A/LM/AQM. These delegations are provided only to warranted contracting officers in the respective offices. They are as follows:
              (1) Office of Language Services. The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation for interpreting, translating, conference reporting, and related language support and escort services.
              (2) Office of Overseas Schools. The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to section 29 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended.
              (3) Library. The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to the provisions of the Public Printing and Documents Act of 1968, as amended, and for the acquisition of newspapers, books, maps, and periodicals.
              (4) Office of International Conferences. The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to section 5, Title I, of the Department of State Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended.
              (5) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR part 13, to enter into and administer contracts over the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $500,000 for non-commercial item acquisitions; up to $6.5 million for the acquisition of commercial items using the simplified acquisition procedures under the Test Program of FAR subpart 13.5; orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation and personal services contracts pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended; and, 48 CFR Chapter 7, Agency for International Development Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR), including any amendments thereto. INL follows the AIDAR guidance for doing personal service contracts. All other contracting actions follow the DOSAR and DoS regulations. These authorities extend to any acquisition performed by any Department of State contracting activity on behalf of INL.
              (6) Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization. The authority to enter into and administer 8(a) purchase orders and contracts as a third party pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Small Business Administration.
              (7) Bureau of Administration, Office of Operations.

The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services on behalf of overseas posts is delegated to each Director, Regional Procurement Support Office (RPSO) at the following locations:
              (i) RPSO Frankfurt in conjunction with Consulate General Frankfurt; and
              (ii) RPSO Florida in conjunction with the Florida Regional Center.
              (c) Execution of delegated authority. (1) Whenever the contracting officer makes use of the various statutory authorities available to the Department to waive the application of the Federal Acquisition Regulation or laws governing acquisition, such as those provided in the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2291) or the Foreign Service Buildings Act (22 U.S.C. 294), a written determination of the basis for using the authority must be prepared and included in the file.
              (2) If the statute or current practice of the requiring office does not specify a particular format, use the following format.

              601.602-1
              Authority.
              (a) DOS contracts are awarded pursuant to the foreign affairs management responsibilities conferred on the Secretary of State (22 U.S.C. 2656), and the various laws, regulations, and Executive Orders relating thereto.

              (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, DOS regulations, and this DOSAR, the Procurement Executive has the authority to execute, award, and administer contracts, purchase orders, other contractual arrangements, and other agreements, including FAR-covered interagency acquisition agreements, for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of personal property, services, and for the sale of personal property. The Procurement Executive may further delegate this authority to those DOS employees appointed or designated to the contracting activities enumerated in 601.601-70.
              (c) The contracting officer shall not award, modify, or terminate a contract unless all reviews, clearances, and approvals prescribed in the FAR or the DOSAR have been obtained, and all applicable requirements of law, the FAR, the DOSAR, and other regulations have been met.

              601.602-3
              Ratification of unauthorized commitments.
              (b) Policy. (1) The Government generally is not bound by unauthorized commitments. Unauthorized commitments violate the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, the FAR, the DOSAR, and proper acquisition practice. Therefore, such unauthorized commitments are serious violations that could result in disciplinary action against the transgressor, e.g., withdrawal of a contracting officer's warrant or a Contracting Officer's Representative delegation or collection action.
              (2)(i) Unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000. The head of the contracting activity is delegated the authority to serve as the ratifying official for unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000, including unauthorized commitments from other agencies where a DOS employee serves as the contracting officer for that action. The head of the contracting activity may refer any actions not exceeding $1,000 to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification if he or she so chooses.
              (ii) Unauthorized commitments exceeding $1,000. All DOS unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 shall be submitted to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification. Unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 from other agencies may be referred to the other agency's representative at post for resolution in accordance with that agency's ratification process.
              (3) Claims. Unauthorized contractual commitments that would involve claims subject to resolution under the Contracts Dispute Act of 1978 shall be processed in accordance with FAR subpart 33.2 and subpart 633.2.
              (4) Disciplinary action. The Procurement Executive may refer egregious cases of unauthorized commitments to HR/ER for possible disciplinary action in accordance with 3 FAM 4370 or 3 FAM 4540. Examples might include repeated unauthorized commitments knowingly made by an employee; failure to take responsibility for a deliberate unauthorized commitment; or similar reasons. The Procurement Executive may revoke the appointment certificate of any contracting officer who makes an unauthorized commitment.

              Procedures.
              (a)(1) The person who made the unauthorized commitment shall submit all records and documents concerning the unauthorized commitment to the contracting officer assigned the ratification action. That person shall provide a complete written, signed statement of the facts, including why normal acquisition procedures were not followed; a statement justifying a sole source acquisition (Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition) if the unauthorized commitment exceeds $100,000; why and how the vendor was selected; a list of other sources considered; a description of work or products; a statement regarding the status of performance; an estimated or agreed price; certified funding citations; a statement as to why he/she should not be personally liable for the cost, e.g., a public purpose was served and no personal benefit was received; a statement as to whether the individual has ever been responsible for any other unauthorized commitments in the Department of State; and, a statement as to the number of unauthorized commitments processed by the responsible office within the last three calendar years and the circumstances surrounding each of these actions.

              (2) When the person who made the unauthorized contractual commitment is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, an officer from the responsible office shall accomplish the requirements of this paragraph; the statement shall identify the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.
              (3) In addition, a cognizant management official from the office that employed the individual who made the unauthorized commitment at the time the unauthorized commitment was made shall provide a statement detailing actions that he/she will take to ensure that such commitments will not occur again under the same or similar circumstances.
              (4) This statement shall be cleared by the Executive Director of the Bureau that employs (or employed) the person who made the unauthorized commitment.
              (b) The contracting officer assigned the ratification action shall prepare and execute a recommendation to the ratifying official. The contracting officer shall either recommend that the ratifying official approve and ratify the unauthorized commitment; or, disapprove the ratification of the unauthorized commitment.
              (1) The recommendation shall include the facts and circumstances of the unauthorized commitment; the information prescribed in FAR 1.602-3(c)(1) and (c)(3) through (6); and a recommendation to the ratifying official as to whether the unauthorized commitment should be ratified.
              (2) Following the signature of the contracting officer, the recommendation shall include a statement that the ratifying official could have granted authority to enter into a contractual commitment at the time it was made and still has the authority to do so; that the ratifying official hereby ratifies (or disapproves) the unauthorized commitment in the amount specified; and a date and signature block for the ratifying official.
              (c) The information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be supported by factual findings included or referenced in the recommendation.
              (d) The contracting officer shall submit the complete file to the ratifying official. For actions exceeding $1,000, the file shall be submitted through the head of the contracting activity to the Procurement Executive.
              (e) Upon receipt and review of the complete file, if the ratifying official ratifies the unauthorized commitment, the file shall be returned, through the head of the contracting activity if the action exceeds $1,000, to the contracting officer for issuance of the appropriate contractual document(s). If the request for ratification is not justified, the ratifying official shall return the request to the head of the contracting activity (if over $1,000) or to the contracting officer (if under $1,000) with a written explanation for the decision and a recommendation for disposition of the action.

              601.603-3
              Appointment.
              (a) General. There is no contracting officer authority conferred upon any DOS employee by virtue of position. The Procurement Executive appoints all DOS contracting officers, in conformance with FAR 1.603-3, with the one exception as noted in paragraph (b) of this section. The contracting officer shall retain the original copy of the Standard Form 1402, Certificate of Appointment, signed by the Procurement Executive. Only qualified employees shall be appointed as contracting officers. A/OPE is responsible for providing guidance and oversight in managing such appointments.
              (b) Temporary warrants. The Chief of Mission is delegated the authority by the Procurement Executive to issue temporary contracting officer warrants for periods up to 90 calendar days in order to cover emergency, post-specific operational requirements (e.g., staffing gaps, medical evacuations, extended leave, etc.). These temporary appointments shall be executed on the Standard Form 1402, and a copy shall be furnished to A/OPE. The warrant shall contain both a dollar limitation of no more than $100,000 and a specific time period (not to exceed 90 days) during which the warrant is effective.
              (c) Non-Federal employees. Only United States Government employees shall be appointed as contracting officers. For acquisitions at $25,000 and below only, this includes locally employed staff (i.e., Foreign Service Nationals and Third Country nationals). Personal services contractors are not eligible for appointment as DOS contracting officers.
              (d) Personal services agreements. Individuals who may sign personal services agreements (PSAs) are limited to the following:
              (1) The Human Resources Officer;
              (2) The Human Resources/Financial Management Officer; or,
              (3) The Management Officer or an American Foreign Service Officer designated to perform human resource functions.
              (e) Real property leases. The FAR and DOSAR do not apply to leases of real property. A contracting officer certificate of appointment is not required. Authority to sign real property leases is as follows:
              (1) Domestic real property leases. The General Services Administration has delegated domestic leasing authority to the Department of State's Office of Real Property Management (A/OPR/RPM). This delegation is accomplished on a case-by-case basis.
              (2) Real property leases abroad. Authority to sign real property leases abroad is held by the Director/Chief Operating Officer (DIR/COO) of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), through the Secretary of State, under the Foreign Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 292 et seq.). Leases at post may be executed by the General Services Officer or by other post administrative personnel as authorized by OBO.

              (f) Electronic files. Offices may maintain files in electronic media provided all documentation is maintained as required by FAR subpart 4.8. Electronic files dispersed in multiple locations, or maintained with no naming convention, do not constitute adequate electronic records.

              Contract file table of contents.
              (a) It is the Department's policy that all contracts, regardless of dollar value, be properly documented so as to provide a complete record of: pre-solicitation activities; the solicitation, evaluation, and award process; and, the administration of the contract through closeout.

              (b) All domestic contracting activities awarding contracts using other than simplified acquisition procedures shall use the format of Form DS-1930, Domestic Contract File Table of Contents, and all overseas contracting activities shall use the format of Form DS-1929, Overseas Contract File Table of Contents, unless an alternate format has been approved by A/OPE.
              (c) Each table of contents is organized in chronological order, with six separate sections for each of the six parts of the file folder (from Section I, Pre-Solicitation, through Section VI, Contract and Modifications/Contract Closeout). Alternatively, for ease of contract administration, offices may choose to organize contract files with Section VI of the table of contents at the beginning of the folder, with Section I at the back of the folder.
              (d) The format of Form DS-1928, Contract Administration File Table of Contents, may be used by those offices that prefer to have a separate file folder for contract modifications or delivery/task orders.

              Contract closeout procedures.

              (a) This section sets forth procedures for closing out contracts awarded using other than simplified acquisition procedures by contracting activities and requirements offices. It is the Department's policy to close out contracts in the time frames prescribed by FAR Part 4.
              (b) Contracting activities are responsible for initiating each contract closeout. Contracting activities and requirements offices are jointly responsible for timely compliance with required contract closeout procedures.
              (c) The contract closeout process shall begin as soon as possible after the contract is physically completed, which means that the contractor has delivered the required supplies and the Government has inspected and accepted them, or the contractor has performed and the Government has accepted all services required by the contract, and the base period and any option periods exercised have expired.
              (d) Specific procedures. The normal steps for closing out a physically completed contract shall be as follows. These steps are summarized in the Contract Closeout Checklist, which shall be completed by the contracting officer and included in the contract file. The contracting officer shall indicate any items that are not applicable (e.g., patent reports, royalty reports, etc.).

              (1) The contracting officer shall verify that all work under the contract has been completed; obtain the COR's assessment of the contractor's performance; and conduct an initial funds status review, i.e., determine if the contract has excess funds that should be deobligated by contract modification. Contracting officers shall send a cover memo to the COR, to which should be attached the COR Completion Certificate, the applicable performance evaluation form (depending on whether the contract is for construction (SF-1420), architect-engineering services (SF-1421), or other supplies or services (DS-1771, Contractor Evaluation Statement)); and, a final payment and closeout memorandum. Contracting officers may require CORs to input past performance data directly into the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) as opposed to completing a paper evaluation form (see 642.1503-70).
              (2) After receipt of the COR's response, and the contractor's release, the contracting officer shall send a final payment memo to the office responsible for payment of invoices/vouchers.
              (3) An audit is required for cost-reimbursement contracts over $550,000, unless available data are considered adequate for a reasonableness determination, in which case the contract file shall be documented with the appropriate rationale. Requests for audits, normally by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) in accordance with the agreement DOS has with DCAA to conduct incurred cost audits, shall be submitted through the A/LM/AQM/BOD/QA Audit Team (see 642.101(b)). Cost-reimbursement contracts may be closed after receipt of the audit report and resolution of any issues raised. Quick closeout procedures may be followed, as prescribed in FAR 42.708. The contracting officer may request an audit of any contract, if warranted; however, audits should not be requested if the cost of the audit is likely to exceed potential cost recovery, except where fraud or misrepresentation is suspected.
              (4) The contracting officer shall send a letter to the contractor requesting release of claims, using the appropriate format. In addition, a Contractor Assignment Letter is required for certain contracts. To determine which format is applicable, contracting officers shall refer to the Payments clause in the contract.
              (5) The contracting officer shall reconcile the contract obligations and contractor payments, and then deobligate any excess funds remaining in the contract by issuing a contract modification on a SF-30. Close coordination with the finance office is necessary in order to receive the required information to perform a funds status review.
              (6) The contracting officer shall verify that all relevant documentation is included in the contract file (see 604.803-70).

              (7) Upon completion of 8(a) contracts, the contracting officer shall complete the Small Business Administration's Contract Completion Form within ten (10) days of contract completion. One copy shall be forwarded to SBA, one copy shall be retained in the contract file, and one copy shall be sent to OSDBU.
              
              (8) For classified contracts, the contractor is required to return to the Department all classified material received or generated under the contract, or to destroy all classified material, unless retention is requested and authorized by the Department. The contracting officer shall notify DS/PRD/IN of contract completion, final delivery of goods or services or the termination of the classified contract. The contracting officer shall ensure that any classified material contained in the contract file is properly marked and accounted for.
              (9) Closeout documents are available on the Intranet at the A/OPE Web site.
              (e) Contract files that have been closed out shall be retained in accordance with the schedule in FAR 4.805.
              (f) Contract files for contracts using simplified acquisition procedures are considered closed when the contracting officer receives evidence of property/services and final payment. Disposal of such files shall be as prescribed in FAR 4.805.

              Policy.
              (c)(1) Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID). Uniform numbers shall be assigned to all DOS procurement instruments, domestic and overseas. The numbering system applies to all contracts, purchase orders, and other related instruments, including solicitation documents and delivery orders. This includes instruments executed by DOS contracting officers on behalf of other federal agencies. It does not include requisitions submitted to a contracting activity, or to instruments awarded under Federal assistance arrangements, e.g., grants, cooperative agreements, and loans. Numbers shall be placed in appropriate spaces on government forms and appear on all documentation intended to support official contract files.
              (2) Responsibility. Heads of contracting activities are responsible for enforcing compliance with the uniform numbering system. Heads of contracting activities shall develop and maintain a system for assigning and recording contract numbers that conforms to this section.
              (3) Instrument identification numbers. A 13-character “alpha-numeric” designator shall be assigned to all DOS procurement instruments. Positions (beginning at the left) one through six shall identify the purchasing office; positions seven and eight, the fiscal year in which the number is assigned; position nine, a symbol designating a type of procurement instrument; and positions ten through thirteen, a four-position serial number.

              (i) The first six positions shall commence with “S” to designate a DOS-issued contract. The remaining five characters shall identify the activity preparing the instrument. Domestic and overseas contracting activities shall assign the character codes using the five-digit designator from the listing at http://www.aopeprocurementreports.com/ReportServer_OPEMS2008/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?%2fDOSReport%2fPostCodeList&rs:Command=Render. DOS organizations not listed shall contact A/OPE for assignment of an office code.
              (ii) The seventh and eighth positions shall be the last two digits of the fiscal year in which the number is assigned.
              (iii) The ninth position shall be a capital letter assigned to indicate the type of instrument, as follows:

A separate set of serial numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. Each series of numbers for the same activity shall begin with the number 0001 at the start of each fiscal year.
              (v)(A) The following illustrates a properly configured contract number for the first number assigned to a fiscal year 2015 contract awarded by the Department of State, Embassy Ottawa: SCA525-15-C-0001
              (B) Use of the dashes to separate the individual elements of the series is optional; however, when reporting individual contract actions to the Federal Procurement Data System (see FAR subpart 6.4), dashes shall not be used.
              (C) Contracting activities are authorized to use the first digit of the serial number (position 10) to establish discrete series of numbers. For example, the “1000” series may be reserved for Bureau of Consular Affairs requirements (domestic), or the “1000” series may be reserved for Economic section requirements (overseas). Use of discrete series is appropriate generally for activities handling large numbers of transactions and can provide useful management information.
              (4) Solicitation amendment and contract modification numbers. Solicitation amendments are to be numbered sequentially, beginning with the alpha designator “A,” e.g., A001. Contract modifications shall also be numbered sequentially, beginning with the alpha designator “M,” e.g., M001.

              (2) Personal services agreements. Prior A/OPE approval is not applicable to personal services agreements, as they are not subject to procurement statute and regulation.
              (b) Domestic contracting activities and Regional Procurement Support Offices. A/OPE reviews domestic acquisitions as described in the A/LM/AQM Quality Assurance Plan.
              (c) Delegation or waiver. The Procurement Executive may delegate or waive the review requirements. In such instances, the Procurement Executive shall provide to each head of the contracting activity, as appropriate, a written delegation or waiver of these requirements.

              604.7101
              Purpose.
              A procurement quality assurance program is essential to the effective operation of each domestic contracting activity. Each domestic contracting activity and RPSO shall develop a quality assurance plan for review and approval of contract actions to ensure that all requirements of law, regulation, Departmental policy, and sound procurement practices are met, the taxpayer's interests are adequately protected, and the Department's mission is well-served. Post quality assurance includes A/OPE review of actions exceeding warrant levels and Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs).

              604.7102-1
              Peer reviews.
              All contract actions above the simplified acquisition threshold shall be independently reviewed by at least one other qualified contracting professional. This includes solicitations, contracts, contract modifications, and delivery/task orders. This requirement is waived for overseas posts and RPSOs that have only one qualified contracting professional.
            
            
              604.7102-2
              Form and scope of review
              (a) The review shall focus on both compliance with statutory/regulatory requirements as well as good contracting practices. Reviews shall be included in the official contract file along with documentation regarding the actions taken in response to the review.
              (b) Reviews should be limited in time to prevent unnecessary procurement lead-time, but thorough in scope, considering all documents in the contract file and all relevant contracting issues. Checklists may be used to facilitate a thorough review, as appropriate.
            
            
              604.7102-3
              Approval.
              The solicitation, contract, or contract modification being reviewed shall not be issued until all review comments requiring corrective action are satisfactorily resolved. Waivers shall not be granted except in unusual circumstances, and shall be approved in advance by the head of the contracting activity.
            
            
              604.7103
              Review by Assistant Legal Adviser for Buildings and Acquisitions (L/BA).
              (a) L/BA shall review solicitations, contract awards, and delivery orders against GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts exceeding $1 million that are generated by domestic contracting activities, including RPSOs. L/BA shall also review domestic contract modifications exceeding $1 million if the scope or ceiling of the contract may be in question. This review is not required for modifications exercising priced options, incremental funding modifications, and similar actions that do not involve questions regarding the scope or ceiling of the contract.
              (b) L/BA shall also review and approve any nonpersonal services contract, purchase order or blanket purchase agreement to be awarded to an individual who is a U.S. citizen.

              Foreign acquisitions.
              (a) Policy. In accordance with a Determination and Findings issued by the Assistant Secretary of State for Administration, the requirement for advance notices in the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) for the Department's foreign acquisitions awarded by overseas contracting activities is waived. GPE notices may be published for any acquisition where the contracting officer decides that publication would be in the Department's best interests.
              (b) Procedures. Contracting officers at overseas contracting activities are not required to prepare an individual determination and findings to document their decision to waive the GPE notice requirements.
              (c) Competition requirements. Nothing in this section waives the requirement to obtain competition as required by FAR part 6 and DOSAR (48 CFR) part 606. Competition, including the use of written solicitation, shall be obtained in all cases to the extent feasible. If there are known U.S. firms or firms with U.S. affiliations in local residence capable of supplying the required supplies or services, the contracting activity shall ensure that those firms are included in the source list for the acquisition.
              (d) Policy exclusions. GPE waiver authority does not apply to local guard service contracts exceeding $250,000, or any contracts exceeding $5 million. Local guard service contracts that exceed $250,000 and other contracts that exceed $5 million shall be published in the GPE. Option year prices shall be included when computing the applicability of this threshold.

              (a)(1) Contracting officers at overseas posts shall submit notices of proposed contract actions to A/OPE for electronic transmittal to the GPE. Alternately, posts may obtain a user ID and password that allows direct registration and issuance of the notice in the GPE. Posts should contact A/OPE for assistance in obtaining the ID and password if they choose to directly input the notice information.

              (b) This subsection applies to all acquisitions involving national security information, regardless of dollar amount. In no case shall information be classified in order to restrict competition. Information may be classified only when its authorized disclosure could be expected to cause damage to national security.
              (c)(1) The Chief, Controls Division, Office of Intelligence Liaison, Directorate for Coordination, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, is responsible for reviewing and certifying on any proposed acquisitions derived from or funded or administered by intelligence community agencies that involve sensitive compartmented information and ensuring that the provisions of Executive Order 13526 and FAR 6.302-6 have been met. The Office Director, Office of Information Security, Security Infrastructure Directorate, Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS/SI/IS) is responsible for reviewing and certifying on all other proposed acquisitions funded by the Department of State that involve national security information and ensuring that the provisions of Executive Order 13256 and FAR 6.302-6 have been met. When disclosure of the Department's needs through full and open competition would compromise national security, the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition shall include the following specific information:
              (i) How national security would be compromised if the Department of State's (or other agencies') needs were disclosed in the GPE;
              (ii) Why the GPE notice cannot be worded in such a manner that national security would not be compromised;
              (iii) Necessity for access to classified information to prepare technical and/or cost proposal and level of security clearance required;
              (iv) Necessity for access to classified information to perform the proposed contract and level of security clearance required;
              (v) Number and value of contracts that the justification covers; and
              (vi) A statement as follows: “I hereby certify that the national security concerns of the referenced acquisition(s) meet the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12958 and FAR 6.302-6”.
              (2) Any acquisition involving national security information shall be publicized in the GPE unless disclosure of the agency's needs would compromise national security.
              (3) The contracting officer is responsible for soliciting offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. However, given the sensitivity required for acquisitions involving national security information, it is expected that requirements offices will work closely with the contracting officer in maximizing competition.

              Department of State standardization program.
              (a) It is the Department's policy to promote full and open competition in all procurement actions. The authority at 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1)shall be used with respect to standardization when only specified makes and models of equipment will satisfy the Department's needs and only one source is available. This policy applies to all acquisitions involving standardization, regardless of dollar amount.
              (b) Contracts awarded under the authority at 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1)shall be supported by the written justification described in FAR 6.303. The contracting officer, requirements office, procuring activity advocate for competition, and the Procurement Executive shall approve all Justifications for Other than Full and Open Competition that cite standardization of technical equipment as justification to restrict competition. The Management Officer at each post is the procuring activity advocate for competition for that post and the requirements office at post is the embassy functional office responsible for identifying the need to contract.

              (c) Procurement of specified makes and models of technical equipment and systems, for which there is only one source of supply, is considered other than full and open competition. Such procurements shall be supported by an approved Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. The justification shall include the content requirements of FAR 6.303-2. The justification shall also address potential cost savings in areas such as inventory, operations, training, maintenance, repairs, and administrative and management support. Areas of consideration for potential cost savings shall be supported by detailed estimates as attachments to the justification. Justifications shall specify an effective period, which shall bear a reasonable relationship to the life of the technical equipment. The effective period shall not exceed six years with a review at the end of the first three years. Periodic reviews shall be made during the standardization period to determine whether the standardization should be continued, revised or canceled.

              Definitions.
              
                Official vehicle means a U.S. Government-owned or leased motor vehicle that is fueled by petroleum or electric batteries, has a minimum of four wheels, and is designed primarily for use on highways, such as sedans, station wagons, buses, carryalls, and trucks.

              Acquisitions for the Department of State.

              (a) A/LM funds and controls the acquisition of official vehicles required by overseas posts. Accordingly, any acquisition of official vehicles by overseas contracting activities must be approved and authorized in advance by A/LM.
              (b) GSA is the mandatory source for U.S. manufactured vehicles acquired in the United States. Purchase requests are submitted by A/LM to GSA on behalf of overseas posts. Overseas posts shall use U.S. manufactured vehicles unless justified as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Overseas posts may acquire non-U.S. manufactured vehicles only in special cases that are approved in advance. Requests to purchase non-U.S. manufactured vehicles may be justified under the conditions specified in 6 FAM 228.9-3(B)(c). The request shall be submitted to A/LM for approval. If approval is granted to acquire non-U.S. manufactured vehicles from the local economy, overseas posts shall follow the normal procedures in the FAR.
              (d) Standardization of motor vehicles shall follow the procedures in 606.370.

              Acquisitions on behalf of other Federal agencies.
              (a) Acquisition of U.S. manufactured vehicles. (1) GSA is the mandatory source for official vehicles purchased in the United States for all Federal agencies. Non-DOS agencies must have a waiver from GSA that allows them to acquire official vehicles from sources in the United States other than GSA, in accordance with the Federal Property Management Regulation, 41 CFR 101-38.104.
              (2) DOS overseas contracting activities shall not obtain GSA waivers or acquire vehicles through GSA or directly from sources in the United States on behalf of other agencies. Requests to acquire vehicles in this manner shall be returned to the requesting agency without action, and the agency instructed to use its own contracting personnel or GSA for this purpose.
              (b) Acquisition from non-U.S. sources. No GSA waiver is required for official vehicles purchased outside the United States from non-U.S. sources. Normal acquisition procedures shall be followed. However, contracting officers should be aware that statutory ceilings apply to the acquisition of passenger vehicles (i.e., sedans and station wagons) (see P.L. 103-329), so other agencies shall not request that posts acquire vehicles without providing an analysis of how the price compares with this ceiling.

              609.406-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. (1) DOS employees aware of any cause that might serve as the basis for debarment shall refer those cases through the contracting officer to the debarring official. The debarring official shall refer to the Office of the Inspector General all reported cases that involve possible criminal or fraudulent activities for investigation by that office.
              (2) Referrals for consideration of debarment shall include, as appropriate and available—
              (i) The cause for debarment (see FAR 9.406-2);
              (ii) A statement of facts;

              (iii) Copies of supporting documentary evidence and a list of all necessary or probable witnesses, including addresses and telephone numbers, together with a statement concerning their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and the subject matter of their testimony;
              (iv) A list of all contractors involved, either as principals or as affiliates, including current or last known home and business addresses and ZIP codes;
              (v) A statement of the acquisition history with such contractors;
              (vi) A statement concerning any known pertinent active or potential criminal investigation, criminal or civil court proceedings, or administrative claim before Boards of Contract Appeals; and
              (vii) A statement from each DOS organizational element affected by the debarment action as to the impact of a debarment on DOS programs.
              (3) As deemed appropriate, the debarring official may conduct investigations to supplement the information provided in the referral, or may request investigations by the Office of the Inspector General or other Department office.
              (b) Decisionmaking process. (1) If the contractor does not respond to a debarment notice within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice, the debarring official may put the debarment into effect.
              (2) In response to the debarment notice, if the contractor or its representative notifies the debarring official within 30 days after receipt of the notice that it wants to present information and arguments in person to the debarring official, that official, or a designee, shall chair such a meeting. The oral presentation shall be conducted informally and a transcript need not be made. However, the contractor may supplement its oral presentation with written information and arguments for inclusion in the administrative record.
              (3) Pursuant to FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), the contractor may request a fact-finding proceeding.
              (4) The debarring official shall designate a fact-finding official and shall provide the fact-finding official with a copy of all documentary evidence considered in proposing debarment. Upon receipt of such material, the fact-finding official shall notify the contractor and schedule a hearing date.
              (5) In addition to the purposes provided in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), the hearing is intended to provide the debarring official with findings of fact based on a preponderance of evidence submitted to the fact-finding official and to provide the debarring official with a determination as to whether a cause for debarment exists, based on the facts as found.
              (6) The fact-finding proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with procedures determined by the fact-finding official. The rules shall be as informal as is practicable, consistent with FAR 9.406-3(b). The fact-finding official is responsible for making the transcribed record of the hearing, unless the contractor and the fact-finding official agree to waive the requirement for a transcript.
              (7) The fact-finding official shall deliver written findings and the transcribed record, if made, to the debarring official. The findings shall resolve any facts in dispute based on a preponderance of the evidence presented and recommend whether a cause for debarment exists.
              (c) Notice of proposal to debar. (1) Upon receipt of a complete referral and after consulting with the Office of the Legal Adviser, the debarring official shall decide whether to initiate debarment action.
              (2) When a determination is made to initiate action, the debarring official shall provide to the contractor and any specifically named affiliates written notice in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c).
              (3) When a determination is made not to initiate action, the debarring official shall so advise the DOS officer who made the referral.
              (d) Debarring official's decision. In addition to complying with FAR 9.406-3(d) and (e), the debarring official shall provide single copies of the decision to each DOS organizational element affected by the decision.

            611.002-70
            Metric system implementation.
            (a) Policy. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 205a, et seq.), requires Federal agencies to establish implementing guidelines pursuant to metric policy to adopt the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measurements for United States trade and commerce. This section establishes the Department of State's metric conversion guidelines.
            (b) Applicability. This section applies to all DOS acquisitions, except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.
            (c) Definitions.
            
            
              Dual system means the use of both traditional and metric systems. For example, an item is designated, produced and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison.
            
              Hard metric means the use of only standard metric (SI) measurements in specifications, standards, supplies and services.
            
              Hybrid system means the use of both traditional and hard metric values in specifications, standards, supplies and services.
            
              Measurement sensitive means any item having an application or meaning depending substantially on some measured quantity. For example, measurement sensitive items include product or performance criteria and standards binding on others, such as emission levels, size and weight limitations, etc.
            
              Metric system means the International System of Units (Le System International d'Unites (SI)) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.
            
              Metrication means any act that increases metric system use, including metric training and initiation or conversion of measurement sensitive processes and systems to the metric system.
            
              Soft metric means the result of mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents. The physical dimensions, however, are not changed.
            
              Traditional system of weights and measurements means the predominant weight and measurement system currently used in the United States, also referred to as the “inch-pound system.” The traditional system includes such commonly used units as inch, foot, yard, mile, pint, quart, gallon, bushel, ounce (fluid and avoirdupois), pound, degree Fahrenheit, ampere, candela, and second.
            (d) Procedures. (1) DOS contracting activities shall implement the metric system in a manner consistent with 15 U.S.C. 205a, et seq.
            
            (2) All DOS contracting activities shall use the metric system in acquisition consistent with security, operations, economic, technical, logistical, training and safety requirements.
            (3) The Department shall encourage industry to adopt the metric system by acquiring commercially available metric products and services that meet the Department's needs whenever practical. Toward this end, solicitations for DOS acquisitions shall:
            (i) State all measurement sensitive requirements in metric terms whenever possible. Alternatives to hard metric are soft, dual and hybrid metric terms. The Metric Handbook for Federal Officials regarding the selection of proper metric units and symbols is available from the National Technical Information Service; and
            (ii) For contracts expected to exceed $500,000 contracting officers shall return to the requirements office all specifications and statements of work that are not expressed in some form of metric terms unless the requirements office has prepared a justification, for the approval of the contracting officer, for the use of non-metric specifications or statements of work. The justification shall be in a format as prescribed by the head of the contracting activity. Option year prices shall be considered when computing the $500,000 threshold.
            (4) Waivers are not required when ordering from Federal Supply Schedules.
            (5) Valid justifications for non-metric specifications or statements of work include, but are not limited to:
            (i) Existing specifications or standards are in inch-pound units, unless conversion of the existing specifications or standards is necessary or advantageous to the Government. Unnecessary retrofit of existing systems with new metric components should be avoided if the total cost of the retrofit, including redesign costs, exceeds $50,000;
            (ii) Metric is not the accepted industry system with respect to a business-related activity; however, soft, hybrid, or dual systems may be used during the transition to hard metric;
            (iii) The use of metric is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.
            (6) The contracting officer shall review and, if acceptable, approve the waiver prior to the release of the solicitation. The waiver shall be placed in the contract file. If the waiver is not approved, the contracting officer shall return it to the requirements office with an explanation for the disapproval.
            (7) The in-house operating metric costs shall be identified. Identification includes, but is not limited to, the cost of metric aids, tools, equipment, training and increased cost to develop metric specifications. All contracting activities and requirements offices shall maintain a record of any costs and/or savings brought about by metric conversion.
            (8) Bulk (loose, unpacked) materials shall be specified and purchased in metric or dual units.

            (9) Measuring devices, shop and laboratory equipment shall be purchased in metric or dual units.
            
            (10) Shipping allowances, bills of lading and other shipping documents shall be expressed in metric or dual units.

              Scope of subpart.
              On September 18, 2001, the Department of Commerce (DOC) authorized the Department of State to use the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS). This authority expires on October 1, 2006. The Department of Defense has approved the Department's Embassy Security Protection Program (DOSESPP) as a national defense program eligible for the priorities support under the DPAS.
            
            
              611.602
              General.
              (c)(1) Authority to use the DPAS is limited to the following circumstances:
              (i) The contract or order must be placed with a U.S. firm; and,
              (ii) The contract or order must be in support of the DOSESPP, which consists of work involving the security of overseas posts. The DOSESPP includes a wide range of elements of both physical and technical security, such as:
              (A) New Embassy/Consulate Compound (NEC/NCC) Program. This program involves the construction of new secure Embassies, Consulates, and related facilities, as well as renovations of newly acquired buildings when used as alternatives to the construction of new secure buildings.
              (B) Physical security upgrade. This includes installation of forced entry/ballistic resistant (FE/BR) windows and doors, walls/fences, active anti-ram barriers, bollards (concrete and steel barriers), and related items.
              (C) Forced entry/ballistic resistant (FE/BR) components. This includes doors, windows, and related facilities and items that can provide the necessary time to protect Government personnel from attack.
              (D) Armored vehicles. This includes passenger vehicles with appropriate armoring.
              (E) Entry control and building surveillance equipment. This includes walk-through metal detectors, X-ray equipment, surveillance cameras, explosive detection equipment, and other features to enhance the protection of Government personnel and facilities.
              (2) DOC has assigned the following priority rating to DOSESPP contracts or orders: DO-H8.
            
            
              611.603
              Procedures.
              (f) Department of State contracting officers are authorized to sign DO-H8 rated contracts or orders. It is the responsibility of the requirements office to determine which contracts or orders should be rated. All contracts with U.S. firms under the DOSESPP will not necessarily need to be assigned a priority rating.
              (g) The contracting officer should place a DO-H8 rating on any contract or order if there is any doubt as to whether a contractor doing work for Embassy security protection will be able to deliver on time. If an unrated contract or order is not completed on time, the contracting officer may modify the contract or order to add the rating; however, the rating shall only be effective for the newly established delivery date, not the original delivery date.

              (1) DOC can provide special assistance to implement the DPAS program in specific cases. For example, the Department may request a higher priority rating, or request that DOC issue a written directive to a contractor that is not complying with the DPAS regulations. In addition, although the DPAS program normally applies only to U.S. firms, if the Department has a prime contract with a foreign firm that will be awarding subcontracts with U.S. firms, the Department may request from DOC authorization to place a rating on the prime contract.

              (2) Contracting officers or requirements offices who wish to request special assistance from DOC must complete DOC Form BXA-999, Request for Special Priorities Assistance, and submit it to A/OPE, which will arrange for submission of the request to DOC.

              (b)(2) It is the Department's policy to use the structured approach for profit/fee analysis contained in the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) FAR Supplement (see 48 CFR chapter 3), for acquisitions awarded by domestic contracting activities and RPSOs. This document may be accessed from A/OPE's Acquisition Web site (see 601.105-3). Contracting officers shall follow these procedures. HHS Form 674, Structured Approach Profit/Fee Objective, or an equivalent form, may be used to document the profit/fee analysis. If more than one pre-negotiation cost objective is developed (e.g., high and low), a separate form should be completed for each. The contracting officer shall ensure that a written explanation is attached to the form justifying the weights chosen for each cost category or factor. This approach considers the factors outlined in FAR 15.404-4(d).
              (c)(4)(i)(B) In accordance with a delegation from OBO, overseas posts may request a waiver from A/OPE if post is unable to negotiate a price for architect-engineer services within the six percent price limitation. To obtain a waiver, the contracting officer must send the following information to A/OPE:
              (1) Description of project;
              (2) Estimated dollar amount, with cost breakdown; and,
              (3) Description of negotiation efforts.

              Specific policies.
            
            
              619.202-70
              The Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (a) Purpose. The Mentor-Protégé Program is designed to motivate and encourage firms to assist small businesses with business development, including small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The program is also designed to improve the performance of DOS contracts and subcontracts, foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between small businesses and prime contractors, and increase the overall number of small businesses that receive DOS contract and subcontract awards. The program is limited to non-commercial item acquisitions.
              (b) Definitions. The definitions of small business (SB), HUBZone small business concern (HUBZone), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) are the same as found in FAR 2.101.
              
                Mentor means a prime contractor that elects to promote and develop small business subcontractors by providing developmental assistance designed to enhance the business success of the protégé.
              
                Protégé means a small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business that is the recipient of developmental assistance pursuant to a mentor-protégé program.
              (c) Non-affiliation. For purposes of the Small Business Act, a protégé firm is not considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely because the protégé firm is receiving developmental assistance from the mentor firm under the program.
              (d) General policy. (1) Eligible business prime contractors not included on the “List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs” that are approved as mentor firms may enter into agreements with eligible protégé.
              (2) A firm's status as a protégé under a DOS contract shall not have an effect on the firm's ability to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.
              (e) Incentives for prime contractor participation. (1) Under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E)), DOS is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small businesses consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to negotiated acquisitions.
              
              (2) Before awarding a contract that requires a subcontracting plan, the existence of a mentor-protégé arrangement, and performance, if any, under an existing arrangement, may be considered by the contracting officer in:
              (i) Evaluating the quality of a proposed subcontracting plan under FAR 19.704-5; and,
              (ii) Assessing the prime contractor's compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in determining contractor responsibility under FAR 19.705-5(a)(1).
              (3) A non-monetary award may be presented annually (or as often as appropriate) to the mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support of a protégé. The Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the Operations Director, OSDBU.
              (f) Measurement of program success. The success of the DOS Mentor-Protégé Program will be measured by:
              (1) The increase in the number and dollar value of contracts awarded to protégé firms under DOS contracts from the date the protégé enters the program;
              (2) The increase in the number and dollar value of contracts and subcontracts awarded to the protégé under other Federal agencies and commercial contracts; and,
              (3) The developmental assistance provided by the mentor firm and the resulting increase in the technical, managerial, financial or other capabilities of the protégé firm, as reported by the protégé.
              (g) Eligibility of mentor firms. A mentor firm:
              (1) May be either a large or small business;
              (2) Must be eligible for award of U.S. Government contracts;
              (3) Must be able to provide developmental assistance that will enhance the ability of protégé to perform as subcontractors; and,
              (4) Will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with protégé and firms with whom they have established business relationships.
              (h) Eligibility of protégé firms. (1) A protégé firm must be:
              (i) A SB, HUBZone, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, or SDVOSB as those terms are defined in FAR 2.101;
              (ii) Small in the NAICS code for the services or supplies to be provided by the protégé to the mentor; and,
              (iii) Eligible for award of U.S. Government contracts.
              (2) Except for SDB and HUBZone firms, a protégé firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this subsection. Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential protégé that they meet the specified eligibility requirements. SDB status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined by FAR 19.304. HUBZone status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined by FAR 19.1303.
              (3) Protégé may have multiple mentors. protégé participating in mentor-protégé programs in addition to DOS's program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of mentoring activity for each agency's program.
              (i) Selection of protégé firms. (1) Mentor firms are solely responsible for selecting protégé firms. The mentor is encouraged to identify and select a broad base of protégé firms whose core competencies support DOS's mission.
              (2) Mentors may have multiple protégé.
              (3) The selection of protégé firms by mentor firms may not be protested, except that any protest regarding the size or eligibility status of an entity selected by a mentor shall be handled in accordance with FAR and SBA regulations.
              (j) Application and agreement process for mentor-protégé teams to participate in the program. (1) Firms interested in becoming a mentor firm shall apply in writing to OSDBU. The application (Form DS-4053, Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program Application), shall be evaluated by the nature and extent of technical and managerial support proposed as well as the extent of financial assistance in the form of equity investment, loans, joint-venture support, and traditional subcontracting support proposed.
              
              (2) A proposed mentor shall submit the application form and associated information to OSDBU.
              (k) OSDBU review of application. (1) OSDBU shall review the information to ensure the mentor and protégé are eligible and the information provided is complete. OSDBU shall consult with the contracting officer on the adequacy of the proposed mentor-protégé arrangement, and its review shall be complete no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the application by OSDBU.
              (2) Upon completion of the review, OSDBU will advise the mentor if its application is acceptable. The mentor may then implement the developmental assistance program in accordance with the approved agreement.
              (3) The agreement defines the relationship between the mentor and protégé firms only. The agreement itself does not create any privity of contract between the mentor or protégé and the DOS.
              (l) Developmental assistance. The forms of developmental assistance a mentor can provide to a protégé include:
              (1) Management guidance relating to:
              (i) Financial management;
              (ii) Organizational management;
              (iii) Overall business management/planning;
              (iv) Business development; and,
              (v) Technical assistance.

              (3) Rent-free use of facilities and/or equipment;
              (4) Property;
              (5) Temporary assignment of personnel to protégé for purpose of training; and,
              (6) Any other types of permissible, mutually beneficial assistance.
              (m) Obligation. (1) A mentor or protégé firm may voluntarily withdraw from the program. However, in no event shall such withdrawal impact the program mission and contractual requirements under the prime contract.
              (2) Mentor and protégé firms shall submit to OSDBU annual reports on program progress of the mentor-protégé agreements. Large business mentors may submit these reports as part of their SB, HUBZone, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, and SDVOSB plan submission in accordance with the due date on the SF-295. DOS shall consider the following in evaluating these reports:
              (i) Specific actions taken by the contractor, during the evaluation period, to increase the participation of protégés as suppliers to the U.S. Government and to commercial entities;
              (ii) Specific actions taken by the mentor, during the evaluation period, to develop the technical and corporate administrative expertise of a protégé as defined in the agreement;
              (iii) To what extent the protégé has met the developmental objectives in the agreement; and,
              (iv) To what extent the mentor firm's participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program resulted in the protégé receiving contract(s) and subcontract(s) from private firms and agencies other than the DOS.
              (3) The DOS OSDBU shall submit the annual reports to the cognizant contracting officer regarding participating prime contractor(s) performance in the program.
              (4) Mentor and protégé firms shall submit an evaluation to the OSDBU at the conclusion of the mutually agreed upon program period, the conclusion of the contract, or the voluntary withdrawal by either party from the program, whichever comes first.
              (n) Internal controls. (1) OSDBU shall oversee the program and shall work with the cognizant contracting officer to achieve program objectives.
              (2) DOS may rescind approval of an existing Mentor-Protégé agreement if it determines that such an action is in the Department's best interest. The rescission shall be in writing and sent to the mentor and protégé firms after approval by the OSDBU Operations Director. Rescission of an agreement does not change the terms of the subcontract between the mentor and the protégé or the prime contractor's obligations under its subcontracting plan.
              (o) Solicitation provision and contract clause. (1) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 652.219-72, Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program, in all unrestricted solicitations exceeding $650,000 ($1,500,000 for construction) that offer subcontracting opportunities.
              
              (2) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at DOSAR 652.219-73, Mentor Requirements and Evaluation, in all contracts where the prime contractor has signed a Mentor-Protégé Agreement with the Department of State.

              General support of the program.
              It is the Department's policy to incorporate its current fiscal year goals as negotiated with the SBA into all pertinent Department solicitations, in addition to the standard subcontract clauses. Incorporation of the goals does not require that large prime contractors must subcontract, but does require that to the extent they plan to subcontract, specific goals be established for doing business with small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned small, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms. Where funds are available, an incentive clause such as that found in FAR 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program, is encouraged.

              To further promote the use of small, disadvantaged, women-owned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned small, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms by large prime contractors, contracting officers are encouraged to consider the adequacy of the subcontracting plans, and/or past performance in achieving negotiated subcontract goals, as part of the overall evaluation of the technical proposals.

OSDBU shall recommend to the contracting officer changes needed to subcontracting plans found to be deficient.

Each contracting activity shall maintain a list of its active prime contracts that contain subcontracting plans.
              (b) Contracting officers shall collect subcontracting data from contractors required to establish subcontracting plans in support of small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned small, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. This data shall be collected annually and semiannually, using Standard Form 295, Summary Subcontracting Report, for the annual submissions, and Standard Form 294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts, for the semiannual submissions. The head of the contracting activity shall forward these reports to the OSDBU Operations Director, not later than the 30th day of the month following the close of the reporting period.

              (b) The contracting activity shall use the System for Award Management (https://www.sam.gov) to establish that the selected 8(a) firm is a current program participant.
              (c) Once an 8(a) contractor has been identified, the agency contracting officer shall establish the price with the selected 8(a) contractor.
              (d) The contracting officer shall issue the purchase order or contract directly to the 8(a) firm in accordance with the provisions of FAR part 13 and DOSAR part 613.

The offering letter should transmit the statement of work, purchase description, technical data package, or specifications and such other information deemed necessary by the contracting officer.
              (b) The contracting officer has greater latitude in holding discussions with the business concerns being considered under an 8(a) program acquisition if under the $4 million competitive threshold for 8(a) competition than under a non-8(a) program acquisition. Informal assessments of potential 8(a) sources shall be within the parameters of 13 CFR 124.308(g). The technical evaluation must be carefully reviewed to determine if any source declared to be unacceptable is capable of being made acceptable.

              (ii) Individuals hired in the United States or its possessions, regardless of citizenship; and,
              (iii) Local nationals and third country nationals where contract performance takes place in a country where there are no local workers' compensation laws.
              (2) Individuals who are self-employed (i.e., they have not incorporated) do not meet the definition of an employee. No Defense Base Act insurance is required when contracting with these individuals.
              (3) Exceptions are discussed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (f) of this section.
              (d) The authority to recommend a waiver from the Defense Base Act, as set forth in FAR 28.305(d), is reserved to the Secretary of State.
              (e)(1) The Secretary of Labor has waived the applicability of the Defense Base Act to all DOS service contracts, including construction, for contractor employees who are local nationals or third country nationals. This waiver is conditioned on the requirement for the contractor to provide workers' compensation benefits against the risk of work injury or death and assume liability toward the employees and their beneficiaries for war-hazard injury, death, capture, or detention as prescribed by the local workers' compensation laws.
              (2) In cases where a contract is performed in a country where there are no local workers' compensation laws, local and third country national contractor employees are considered to be “covered contractor employees”, and the contractor shall acquire Defense Base Act insurance for those employees pursuant to the contract between the Department of State and the Defense Base Act insurance broker.

              (f)(1) Section 16 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act (22 U.S.C. 2680a), as amended, provides that the Defense Base Act shall not apply with respect to such contracts as the Secretary of State determines are contracts with persons employed to perform work for the Department of State on an intermittent basis for not more than 90 days in a calendar year. The Department of State has established that “persons” includes employees hired by companies under contract with the Department. The Procurement Executive has the authority to issue the waivers for employees who work on an intermittent or short-term basis. Waivers may be issued only for employees who are U.S. citizens and residents, and only where the contractor provides evidence of alternative workers' compensation coverage for those employees. Waivers may not be issued for local or third country nationals.
              (2) The contractor shall submit waiver requests to the contracting officer. The request shall contain the following information:
              (i) Contract number;
              (ii) Name of contractor;
              (iii) Brief description of the services to be provided under the contract and country of performance;
              (iv) Name and position title of individual(s);
              (v) Nationality of individual(s) (must be U.S. citizen or resident);
              (vi) Dates (or timeframe) of performance at the overseas location; and
              (vii) Evidence of alternative workers' compensation coverage for these employees (e.g., evidence that the State workers' compensation program covers workers on short-term foreign assignments).
              (3) The contracting officer shall review the request for completeness and accuracy. If the request is complete and accurate, the contracting officer shall forward the request to the Procurement Executive. If the contractor does not provide complete and accurate information, the contracting officer shall return the request to the contractor with an explanation as to what additional information is required.
              (4) The Procurement Executive shall review requests for waiver forwarded by the contracting officer and either approve or disapprove the request. The Procurement Executive shall return the request indicating his/her approval or disapproval to the contracting officer. Any request that is not approved shall describe the reason(s) why the request was not approved. The contracting officer shall provide the contractor with the original of the approved or disapproved document and maintain a copy in the contract file.

              The Department's policy is to provide full funding for all contracts, to the maximum extent practicable. FAR 32.704 and 32.705-2 provide for incremental funding of cost-reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contracts for severable services may also be incrementally funded if full funding is not available at the time of contract award and the contracting officer executes a determination and findings, approved by the requirements office, justifying the need for incremental funding due to the unavailability of funds.

              633.214-70
              DOS ADR program.
              (a) Policy. The Department's goal is to resolve contract disputes before the issuance of a contracting officer's final decision under the Disputes statute (41 U.S.C. chapter 71). Contracting officers shall consider all possible means of reaching a negotiated settlement, consistent with the Government's best interests, before issuing a final decision on a contractor claim under the process outlined in FAR 33.206 through 33.211.
              
              (b) When to use ADR—(1) Factors favoring ADR. Contracting officers should consider using ADR in those cases where:
              (i) Only facts are in dispute;
              (ii) The facts are clearly not favorable to the Government;
              (iii) The anticipated costs (in time and money) are less than the anticipated costs of litigation;
              (iv) Settlement attempts have reached an impasse;
              (v) ADR techniques have been used successfully in similar situations;
              (vi) There is a need for independent expert analysis; or,
              (vii) The claim has merit but its value is overstated.
              (2) Factors disfavoring ADR. The following circumstances do not favor use of ADR:
              (i) Cases involving disputes controlled by clear legal precedent, making compromise difficult;
              (ii) The resolution will have a significant impact on other pending cases or on the future conduct of Department business;
              (iii) The dispute is primarily over issues of law;
              (iv) A decision of precedential value is needed;
              (v) A significant policy question is involved;
              (vi) A full public record of the proceeding is important;
              (vii) The outcome could significantly involve persons who are not parties to the contract;
              (viii) The costs of pursuing an ADR procedure (in time and money) exceed the cost of litigation;
              (ix) The nature of the case may cause ADR to be used merely for delay or discovery; or,
              (x) The case involves criminal violations.
              (3) Initial action. Immediately upon receipt of a claim, the contracting officer shall send a letter acknowledging receipt of the claim and soliciting the contractor's views on submitting this claim for ADR. In every dispute, the first step toward resolution shall be unassisted negotiations, in which the parties try to work out the disagreement among themselves. If this fails, before issuing a final decision, the contracting officer shall consult first with the head of the contracting activity, and contact the Office of the Legal Adviser and A/OPE to determine whether the disagreement appears susceptible to resolution by ADR. Consideration shall be given to pursuing additional fact-finding or designating a neutral expert in the disputed issue to provide an advisory opinion.
              (c) Methods of ADR. If the initial action to resolve the dispute fails, and the contracting officer issues a final decision which is appealed, ADR may still be feasible. The CBCA issues a notice regarding ADR to all contractors who file appeals under the Contract Disputes Act. This notice describes the following ADR techniques, which contracting officers are urged to discuss with contractors at any time:
              (1) Settlement judge. A settlement judge is either an administrative judge or hearing examiner who is appointed by the parties in dispute for the purpose of facilitating settlement. The agenda is flexible and based on the specifics of the individual dispute. By holding a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position, the settlement judge may be able to foster a settlement of the dispute. The settlement judge may meet with the parties jointly or individually, and the settlement judge's recommendations are not binding. Typically, the settlement judge's opinions, based on his or her experience in handling prior disputes, will help the parties realize whether their arguments have merit or not.
              (2) Minitrial. A minitrial is not an actual trial but rather a flexible, expedited, but structured procedure in which each party presents an abbreviated version of its position both to a neutral advisor (who may be appointed by the CBCA) and to principals of the parties who have full contractual authority to conclude a settlement. The parties mutually decide on the form of presentation without regard to traditional judicial proceedings or rules of evidence. An advance agreement by the parties specifies the procedure to be followed in making presentations, as well as the role of the neutral advisor. Upon conclusion of the presentations, settlement negotiations are conducted. The neutral advisor may assist the parties in negotiating settlement, including making non-binding recommendations.
              (3) Summary trial with binding decision. A summary trial with binding decision is a procedure in which the scheduling of an appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an administrative judge or panel of judges. The length of the trial and the time for presentation and decision are tailored to the needs of the particular case. Trial procedures and rules applicable to appeals are modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal. The parties must agree, however, that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the judge(s) are final, conclusive, and not appealable, and may not be set aside, except for fraud. A summary “bench” decision is issued at the conclusion of the trial or a summary written decision will be issued within ten (10) days of either the trial's conclusion or receipt of a trial transcript.
              (4) Mediation. Mediation is a process in which a neutral and impartial third party assists the Government and the contractor in conflict to negotiate an acceptable settlement of contested issues. The mediator is jointly selected and is asked by the disputing parties to assist them to reach a voluntary agreement. The mediator has no decisionmaking authority and cannot impose a decision. Mediation assistance involves working with the parties to improve their communications, clarify or interpret data, identify key issues to be discussed, design an effective negotiation process, generate settlement options, or help to identify or formulate areas of agreement. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet: http://www.adrr.com
              
              (5) Arbitration. Non-binding arbitration is a process in which a dispute is jointly submitted by the Government and a contractor to an impartial and neutral person or panel who provides a written, non-binding opinion used as a guide for negotiations toward a settlement. Although the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-552) allows agencies to use binding arbitration, the law provides that the agency head may vacate any arbitration award within 30 days after it is served on all parties. For this reason, non-binding arbitration is preferable. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet: http://www.adrr.com
              
              (6) Partnering. Partnering involves an agreement in principle to share the risks involved in completing a project, and to establish and promote a partnership environment. Partnering itself is not a contractual agreement and it does not create any legally enforceable rights, but instead partnering seeks to create a new cooperative attitude in completing Government contracts. The three basic steps in partnering are:
              (i) Establish the new relationship through personal contact among the principals for the Government and the contractor before the work begins;
              (ii) Prepare a joint statement of goals establishing common objectives in specific detail for reaching the goals; and,

              (iii) Identify specific dispute prevention processes designed to head off problems, evaluate performance, and promote cooperation. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet: http://www.adrr.com
              
              (d) ADR procedures. The ADR method shall be selected voluntarily by both the Government and the contractor. Both parties shall agree on the procedures to be followed, including the agenda and amount of time allowed for each party to present its case. The parties may choose not to have a written transcript or hearing on the record, as this might inhibit settlement. Also, the decision rendered, if any, should not be considered to establish any precedent for future litigation unless the parties agree otherwise. In cases where the parties agree to pay jointly for a third-party neutral advisor, it is recommended that the parties and the advisor agree on a fair and reasonable price. The Government would then issue a simplified acquisition (if the dollar amount does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold) for 50% of the agreed price, and the advisor would submit separate invoices (each for 50% of the price) to the Government and the contractor.

              Foreign Service Buildings Act of 1926, as amended.
              (a) Policy. Section 11 of the Foreign Service Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 302) limits competition for the construction, alteration, or repair of buildings or grounds abroad exceeding $5 million to:
              (1) American-owned firms; or
              (2) Firms from countries which permit or agree to permit substantially equal access to American firms for comparable diplomatic and consular building projects.
              (b) Limitation. This participation may be permitted by or limited to:

              (1) Host-country firms where required by international agreement; or
              
              (2) By the laws of the host country; or
              (3) Where determined by the Secretary of State to be necessary in the interest of bilateral relations or necessary to carry out the construction project.
              (c) Evaluation preference. For purposes of determining competitive status, American-owned firms shall receive a ten (10) percent price preference reduction, provided that two prospective responsible bidders/offerors submit a bid/offer.

              (a) Preference for United States contractors. The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-399; 22 U.S.C. 4852) limits certain construction projects abroad to United States persons or qualified United States joint venture persons. The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 applies to the following, as determined by the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security:
              (1) Diplomatic construction or design projects abroad exceeding $10 million; or,
              (2) Diplomatic construction projects abroad at any dollar amount that involve technical security, unless the project involves low-level technology.
              (b) Exception. This preference shall not apply with respect to any diplomatic construction or design project in a foreign country whose statutes prohibit the use of United States contractors on such projects.
              (c) Subcontracting limitation. With respect to a diplomatic construction project, a prime contractor may not subcontract more than 50 percent of the total value of the contract for that project.

              (d) For the Foreign Service Institute, section 704(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4024);

              (f) For the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, section 5 of the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 296);
              (g) For the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, section 7 of the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287e);
              (h) For the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, the separate State Department appropriations acts; and

              637.104-71
              Personal services agreements.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies only to personal services agreements (PSAs) awarded under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c).
              
              (b) Definition. “Personal Services Agreement (PSA)” is a method of employment using the statutory authority under 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). The Procurement Executive has delegated program management responsibility for PSAs awarded under the Department of State basic authority at 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). When applied to U.S. citizens hired under this authority, the term “PSA Plus” is normally used.
              (c) Policy. DOS contracting officers at overseas posts should not award any personal services contracts that are subject to acquisition statutes and regulations.
              (d) Authority. (1) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, amended section 2(c) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2669(c)) by revising the Department's authority. This language states: “and such contracts are authorized to be negotiated, the terms of the contracts to be prescribed, and the work to be performed, where necessary, without regard to such statutory provisions as relative to the negotiation, making, and performance of contracts and performance of work in the United States.”
              (2) This authority was further amended under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 which added subsection (n) to 22 U.S.C. 2669. This language states “exercise the authority provided in section (c), upon the request of the Secretary of Defense or the head of any other department or agency of the United States, to enter into personal services contracts with individuals to perform services in support of the Department of Defense or such other department or agency, as the case may be.” This authority allowed the use of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c) by all other agencies, provided they meet certain criteria and agree to follow certain guidelines laid out in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). That MOA is not signed at the post level, but by a senior official at the Department of State and the other agency. Without the MOA in place, other agencies may not use this basic authority. HR/OE has responsibility for implementation of the authority that came with this legislative change. The HR/OE Web site includes the latest listing of agencies that have signed the MOA and can use this authority.
              (3) This statutory language has continuing effect and provides authority to the Department of State, and now other agencies, if they so agree, to obtain personal services without adherence to acquisition statutes. In furtherance of the authority provided by the statute, the Procurement Executive has waived the applicability of acquisition regulations when obtaining personal services under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). As a result, it is not necessary for the individual executing a PSA under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c) to have a contracting officer's certificate of appointment required under FAR 1.603 and 601.603 (see 601.603-3(d)).
              (e) Signatory authority. Only direct hire U.S. citizens may sign PSAs. Provided the individual meets that criterion, individuals who may sign PSAs are limited to the following:
              (1) The Human Resources Officer;
              (2) The Human Resources/Financial Management Officer; or,
              (3) The Management Officer or American FSO designated to perform human resources functions (e.g., GSO, RSO, etc.).

              (b) The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 652.237-72, Observance of Legal Holidays and Administrative Leave, in all solicitations and contracts where contractor personnel will be working on-site in any Department of State facility. Overseas contracting activities may add local holidays to the list included in paragraph (a) of the clause.

              Termination action decisions after debarment.
              (a) Prior to making a decision to terminate, based on the consideration listed below, the contracting officer shall have the proposed action reviewed and approved by:
              (1) The Office of the Legal Adviser;
              (2) An individual one level above the contracting officer; and
              (3) For overseas posts, A/OPE.
              (b) Termination for default. Termination for default under a contract's default clause is appropriate when the circumstances giving rise to the debarment or suspension also constitute a default in the contractor's performance of that contract. Debarment or suspension of the contractor for reasons unrelated to the performance of that contract may not support a termination for default.
              (c) Termination for convenience or cancellation. Termination for convenience or cancellation under appropriate contract clauses should be considered when the contractor presents a significant risk to the Government in completing a current contract and when such termination for convenience or cancellation is determined to be in the Government's best interests. In making this determination, the contracting officer should consider such factors as the—
              (1) Seriousness of the cause for debarment or suspension;
              (2) Extent of contract performance;
              (3) Potential costs to the Government;

              (4) Urgency of the requirement and the impact of the delay; and/or
              
              (5) Availability of other safeguards to protect the Government's interests.

                Price Adjustment (AUG 1999)
                (a) The contract price may be increased or decreased in actual costs of direct service labor which result directly from laws enacted and effective during the term of this contract by the [insert name of country] Government. Direct service labor costs include only the costs of wages and direct benefits (such as social security, health insurance, unemployment compensation insurance) paid to or incurred for the direct benefit of personnel performing services under one of the categories listed in Section [identify section number] of this contract. Price adjustments will include only changes in direct service labor costs incurred in order to comply with the requirements of the law. No adjustment will be made under this clause with respect to labor costs of personnel not performing direct service labor under the categories of Section [identify section], nor for overhead, profit, general and administrative (G&A) costs, taxes or any other costs whatsoever.
                (b) For the contracting officer to consider any request for adjustment, the contractor shall demonstrate in writing:
                (1) That the change in the law occurred during the term of this contract and subsequent to the award date of this contract; and,
                (2) That the change in the law could not have been reasonably anticipated prior to contract award; and,
                (3) How the change in the law directly affects the contractor's costs under this contract.
                (c) The contractor shall present data that clearly supports any request for adjustment. This data shall be submitted no later than 30 calendar days after the changes in the law have been made public. This data shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
                (1) The calculation of the amount of adjustment requested; and,
                (2) Documentation which identifies and provides the appropriate portions of the text of the particular law from which the request is derived.
                (d) In order to establish the change between the requested adjusted rate and the original rate, the contractor shall support the appropriate data and composition of the original rate and the requested adjusted rate. This shall include details regarding specific hourly rates paid to individual employees. For contracts paid in U.S. dollars, the contractor's request for price adjustment shall present data reflecting:
                (1) The exchange rate in effect on the date of the contractor's proposal that was accepted for the basic contract; and
                (2) The current exchange rate and its effect on payment of workers in local currency. The allowable adjustment shall be limited to the extent to which increases in direct service labor costs due to host country law changes are not offset by exchange rate gains.
                (e) Only direct cost changes mandated by enacted laws shall be considered for adjustment under this contract. Changes for purposes of maintaining parity of pay between employees at the minimum mandated levels and employees already paid at levels above the newly mandated minimums shall not be considered. Therefore, if the contractor elects to increase payments to employees who are already being paid at or above the mandated amounts, such increased costs shall be borne solely by the contractor and shall not be justification for an increase in the hourly and monthly rates under this contract.
                (f) Any request for adjustment shall be presented by signature of an officer or general partner of the contractor having overall responsibility for the conduct of the contractor's affairs.
                (g) No adjustment shall be made to the contract price that relates to any indirect, overhead, or fixed costs, profit or fee. Only the changes in direct service labor wages (and any benefits based directly on wages) shall be considered by the U.S. Government as basis for contract price changes.
                (h) No request by the contractor for an adjustment under this clause shall be allowed if asserted after final payment has been made under this contract.
                (i) This clause shall only apply to laws enacted by the [insert name of country] Government meeting the criterion set forth above in paragraph (b). No adjustments shall be made due to currency fluctuations in exchange rates.

              Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as Amended.
              As prescribed in 625.7002(b), insert the following clause:
              
                Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as Amended (AUG 1999)
                (a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:
                (1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli business concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;
                (2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person;
                (3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such U.S. person;
                (4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel;
                (5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and,
                (6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing a letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.
                (b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden “compliance with the boycott,” and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)'s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1)-(6) above:
                (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:

                (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,
                (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;
                (2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;
                (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;
                (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;
                (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,
                (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.

              Limitation of Funds.
              As prescribed in 632.706-70, insert the following clause:
              
                Limitation of Funds (AUG 1999)
                (a) Of the total price in Section B (or the “Prices” section), only the amount stated on the contract award document or subsequent modifications is now available for payment and obligated under this contract. It is anticipated that from time to time, additional funds will be obligated under the contract until the total price of the contract is obligated.
                (b) The Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse the contractor more than the amount obligated pursuant to this clause. The contractor agrees to perform the contract up to the point at which the total amount paid and payable by the Government (including amounts payable for subcontracts and settlement costs if this contract is terminated for convenience) approximates but does not exceed the total amount obligated.
                (c)(1) It is contemplated that funds now obligated under this contract will cover the work to be performed until [contracting officer insert date].

                (2) If the contractor considers the funds obligated under this contract to be insufficient to cover the work to be performed until that date, or another date agreed to by the parties, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing and indicate the date on which it expects expended funds to approximate 75 percent of the total amount obligated. The notice shall state the estimated amount of additional funds required to continue performance through the date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or another date agreed to by the parties.
                (3) If, after notification is provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, additional funds are not obligated, or an earlier date than the date in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause is not agreed to, the contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance under this contract (including actions under the termination clause of this contract) beyond the funds obligated for contract performance.
                (d) When additional funds are obligated from time to time for continued performance of this contract, the contract shall be modified to increase the funds obligated and to indicate the period of performance for which funds are applicable. The contractor may notify the contracting officer as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause regarding any additional funds obligated.
                (e) If the contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of work under this contract, solely by reason of the Government's failure to obligate additional funds in amounts sufficient for the timely performance of this contract, an equitable adjustment may be made to the price, or time of delivery, or both.
                (f) This clause shall become inoperative upon obligation of funds sufficient to cover the full price stated in the contract, except for rights and obligations then existing under this clause.
                (g) Nothing in this clause shall affect the Government's right to terminate the contract for convenience or default.

              Additional Safety Measures.
              As prescribed in 636.513, insert the following clause.
              ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES (OCT 2017)
              In addition to the safety/accident prevention requirements of FAR 52.236-13, Accident Prevention Alternate I, the contractor shall comply with the following additional safety measures.
              (a) High risk activities. If the project contains any of the following high risk activities, the contractor shall follow the section in the latest edition, as of the date of the solicitation, of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health manual, EM 385-1-1, that corresponds to the high risk activity. Before work may proceed, the contractor must obtain approval from the COR of the written safety plan required by FAR 52.236-13, Accident Prevention Alternate I (see paragraph (f) of this clause), containing specific hazard mitigation and control techniques.
              (1) Scaffolding;
              (2) Work at heights above 1.8 meters;
              (3) Trenching or other excavation greater than one (1) meter in depth;

Temporary wiring and portable electric tools require the use of a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) in the affected circuits; other electrical hazards may also require the use of a GFCI;
              (9) Work in confined spaces (limited exits, potential for oxygen less than 19.5 percent or combustible atmosphere, potential for solid or liquid engulfment, or other hazards considered to be immediately dangerous to life or health such as water tanks, transformer vaults, sewers, cisterns, etc.);
              (10) Hazardous materials—a material with a physical or health hazard including but not limited to, flammable, explosive, corrosive, toxic, reactive or unstable, or any operations, which creates any kind of contamination inside an occupied building such as dust from demolition activities, paints, solvents, etc.; or

              (b) Safety and health requirements. The contractor and all subcontractors shall comply with the latest edition of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health manual EM 385-1-1, or OSHA 29 CFR part 1910 or 1926 if no EM 385-1-1 requirements are applicable, and the accepted contractor's written safety program.
              (c) Mishap reporting. The contractor is required to report immediately all mishaps to the COR and the contracting officer. A “mishap” is any event causing injury, disease or illness, death, material loss or property damage, or incident causing environmental contamination. The mishap reporting requirement shall include fires, explosions, hazardous materials contamination, and other similar incidents that may threaten people, property, and equipment.
              (d) Records. The contractor shall maintain an accurate record on all mishaps incident to work performed under this contract resulting in death, traumatic injury, occupational disease, or damage to or theft of property, materials, supplies, or equipment. The contractor shall report this data in the manner prescribed by the contracting officer.
              (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (e), with appropriate changes in the designation of the parties, in subcontracts.
              (f) Written program. The plan required by paragraph (f)(1) of the clause entitled “Accident Prevention Alternate I” shall be known as the Site Safety and Health Plan (SSHP) and shall address any activities listed in paragraph (a) of this clause, or as otherwise required by the contracting officer/COR.
              (1) The SSHP shall be submitted at least 10 working days prior to commencing any activity at the site.
              (2) The plan must address developing activity hazard analyses (AHAs) for specific tasks. The AHAs shall define the activities being performed and identify the work sequences, the specific anticipated hazards, site conditions, equipment, materials, and the control measures to be implemented to eliminate or reduce each hazard to an acceptable level of risk. Work shall not begin until the AHA for the work activity has been accepted by the COR and discussed with all engaged in the activity, including the Contractor, subcontractor(s), and Government on-site representatives.
              (3) The names of the Competent/Qualified Person(s) required for a particular activity (for example, excavations, scaffolding, fall protection, other activities as specified by EM 385-1-1) shall be identified and included in the AHA. Proof of their competency/qualification shall be submitted to the contracting officer or COR for acceptance prior to the start of that work activity. The AHA shall be reviewed and modified as necessary to address changing site conditions, operations, or change of competent/qualified person(s).

                Statement of Qualifications for the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act (FEB 2015)
                (a) This solicitation is subject to Section 402 of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-399; 22 U.S.C. 4852). The Act limits certain construction projects abroad to United States persons or United States joint venture persons. This Statement of Qualifications shall be used to determine if a bidder/offeror meets the definition of a “United States person” or a “United States joint venture person” .
                (b) Definition. As used in this provision—
                
                  U.S. person means a company, partnership, or joint venture that the Government determines, after consideration of all available information, including but not limited to that provided by the bidder/offeror in response to this solicitation, to be qualified pursuant to Section 402.
                (c) Representation. The bidder/offeror represents as part of its bid/offer that it □ does □ does not meet the qualifications as a U.S. person as set forth in Section 402 of the Act.

                  Warning: Any material misrepresentation made in the Statement of Qualifications may be the basis for disqualification of a bidder/offeror and reference for consideration of suspension or debarment or for prosecution under Federal law (cf. 18 U.S.C. 1001). Bidder/offeror qualifications will be determined primarily on the basis of information submitted in the Statement of Qualifications, including attachments thereto, but the Government may, at its discretion, rely on information contained elsewhere in the bidder's/offeror's bid/proposal or obtained from other sources.
                (d) Statement of Qualifications for Purposes of Determining Status as a U.S. Person (22 U.S.C. 4852). A bidder/offeror that represents that it is a U.S. person must provide the following information.
                Statement of Qualifications for Purposes of Determining Status as a U.S. Person (22 U.S.C. 4852)
                Name and address of U.S. person organization providing this information:
                
                
                
                
                
                  Introduction. Section 402 of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act (Public Law 99-399) provides that a “United States person” or a “qualified United States joint venture” must meet certain requirements, listed in sections 402(c)(2) and (3) of the Act, to be eligible to compete. To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person, guidance is hereby provided. For ease of reference, the statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it. Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.
                
                
                  Note:

                  The Statement of Qualifications shall provide information correctly applicable to the U.S. person whose qualifications are being certified, and shall not include information pertaining to corporate affiliates or subsidiaries. Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture. A prospective bidder/offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. firm that guarantees performance. To be considered a “qualified United States joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. By signing this bid/proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.
                
                
                1. Section 402(c)(2)(A): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which—(A) is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States, including the District of Columbia, and local laws.”
                Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determinations of eligibility—
                
                  Incorporated means the successful de jure incorporation of a business organization pursuant to the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof.
                
                  Legally organized means the legally recognized existence of an organization other than a de jure corporation (e.g., a partnership) under the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof. Only organizations that have a legal status, including the right to bring suit, to sign contracts, and to hold property under the law of the jurisdiction where they are doing business will qualify as legally organized. A natural person who is a United States citizen acting in his or her entrepreneurial capacity will be deemed to be a “person legally organized” within the scope of this definition, provided that the prospective bidder/offeror holds all required licenses to do business in the jurisdiction where he or she is located.
                
                  United States means any jurisdiction that is one of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.
                
                  Question 1. The organization seeking eligibility under Section 402 is incorporated or is legally organized under the laws of what jurisdiction?
                
                
                2. Section 402(c)(2)(B): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which—(B) has its principal place of business in the United States.”
                Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determinations of eligibility—
                
                  Principal place of business means the main location of the prospective bidder/offeror. For purposes of this section, a prospective bidder/offeror shall identify only one principal place of business, and such location shall include at least the offices of the chief operating officer and headquarters staff. The named location must be a United States jurisdiction from which a tax return has been filed or will be filed during the calendar year in which the prospective bidder/offeror submits this bid/offer.
                
                  United States means any jurisdiction that is one of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.
                
                  Question 2(a). The organization seeking eligibility has its principal place of business in what city and state?
                
                
                
                  Question 2(b). What kind of tax return was or will be filed, and in what jurisdiction, during the current calendar year?
                 (i) Jurisdiction:

Organizations that have been bought, sold, merged, or otherwise substantially altered or enlarged their principal business activities will have the burden of proving that there have been ongoing operations by the same business entity for the required period of time. If the successor entity has acquired all of the assets and liabilities of the predecessor business and the predecessor business has no further existence, the successor may claim the incorporation date of the predecessor. In any other circumstance, the prospective bidder/offeror must show that the law of the jurisdiction in which it operates regards the prospective bidder/offeror as the complete successor in interest of the predecessor business for purpose of contractual obligations.

                4. Section 402(c)(2)(D): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which has performed within the United States or at a United States diplomatic or consular establishment abroad administrative and technical, professional, or construction services similar in complexity, type of construction, and value to the contract being bid.”
                Definitions for purposes of Section 402 determination of eligibility—
                
                  Administrative and technical, professional, or construction services means the kind of work in which the prospective bidder/offeror is interested. If the proposed contract is for construction management services, the prospective bidder/offeror will be expected to demonstrate construction management expertise. In general, “administrative” means the capacity or ability to manage; “technical” means the specific skills peculiar to the type of work required; “professional” means expert services resulting from advanced training in the type of work required; and “construction” experience if it has not directly performed all of the actual construction activities. Thus, an entity whose only construction work experience was performed by its legally distinct subsidiary or parent will not be considered to have construction experience.
                
                  Complexity means the physical size and technical size and demands of the project. “Performed” means projects that have been fully completed by the prospective bidder/offeror and accepted by the owner or other party to the transaction. Projects still in progress have not yet been performed for purposes of this definition.
                
                  Type of construction means the overall nature of the facilities to be built, including the kinds of materials to be used. Thus, if the contract will require the construction of a multi-story office building, the prospective bidder/offeror will be expected to demonstrate experience with facilities of this type.
                
                  Value means the total contract price of the project, not to the profit or loss to the bidder/offeror.
                
                  Within the United States means a United States jurisdiction that is the place where the subject matter of the contract or other arrangement was in fact completed. It does not mean the place where the contract or other arrangement was negotiated or signed. The term “United States” means any jurisdiction that is one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.

                Value of project:

                5. Section 402(c)(2)(E): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which—with respect to a construction project under subsection (a)(1)—has achieved a total business volume equal to or greater than the value of the project being bid in 3 years of the 5-year period before the date specified in subparagraph (C)(i).”

In the case of a partnership, the term refers to every general partner. In the case of a corporation, the term refers to those officers of the corporation who are active in running its day-to-day operations.

Each prospective bidder/offeror is responsible for listing all of its principal management positions and identifying their current occupants by name and citizenship.

                Statement of Qualifications for Purposes of Obtaining Preference as a U.S. Person (22 U.S.C. 4864)
                Name and address of U.S. person or organization providing this information:
                
                
                
                
                  Introduction. Section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Public Law 101-246 (22 U.S.C. 4864), as amended, provides that a “United States person” or a “qualified United States joint venture” must meet certain requirements, listed in the Act, to be eligible for the statutory preference. To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person entitled to preference under Section 136, guidance is hereby provided. Only those prospective offerors submitting a properly completed and certified Volume 5 with their initial proposals will be considered in the determination of eligibility for assignment of preference as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person. For ease of reference, statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it. Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.
                
                
                  Note:
                  The Statement of Qualifications shall provide information correctly applicable to the U.S. person whose qualifications are being certified, and shall not include information pertaining to corporate affiliates or subsidiaries. Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of another organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or local, national or offshore organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture. The contract resulting from this solicitation shall not allow subcontracting. A prospective offeror may be a sole proprietorship, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture with no written agreement. To be considered a “qualified joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. joint venture person listed in Section 136. By signing this proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.
                
                
                1. Section 136(d)(1): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which—(A) is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States, including the laws of any State, locality, or the District of Columbia.”
                Definitions for purposes of Section 136 determinations of eligibility—
                
                  Incorporated means the state of legal recognition as an artificial person that may be afforded to a business entity pursuant to the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof.
                
                  Legally organized means the state of legal recognition that may be afforded to a business entity that is other than a corporation pursuant to the laws of any United States jurisdiction or component thereof. This is the least form of legal recognition that will qualify an offeror for this preference. Only those prospective offerors that have legal status, including the right to bring suit, to sign contracts, and to hold property under the law of the jurisdiction under which they are doing business will qualify as legally organized. A natural person who is a United States citizen acting in his or her entrepreneurial capacity will be deemed to be a “person legally organized” within the scope of this definition, provided that the prospective offeror holds all required licenses to do business in the jurisdiction where he or she is located.
                
                  United States means any jurisdiction that is one of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, a United States territory, a United States possession, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.
                
                  Question 1. The organization seeking eligibility under Section 136 is incorporated or is legally organized under the laws of what jurisdiction?
                
                
                2. Section 136(d)(1): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person that—(B) has its principal place of business in the United States.”
                Definitions for purposes of Section 136 determinations of eligibility—
                
                  Principal place of business means the geographic location of the main office or seat of management of the prospective offeror. For purposes of this Statement, a prospective offeror shall identify only one principal place of business, and such location shall include at least the offices of the chief operating officer and headquarters staff. The named location must be a United States jurisdiction in which the prospective offeror may bring suit and be sued and in which service of process shall be accepted.
                
                  Question 2(a). The organization seeking eligibility has its principal office in what city and state?
                
                  
                
                
                  Question 2(b). What kind of tax return was or will be filed, and in what jurisdiction, during the current calendar year? The jurisdiction identified herein need not be the same jurisdiction identified in Question 2(a).
                
                (i) Jurisdiction:

Section 136(d)(1): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which—(C) has been incorporated or legally organized in the United States—(i) for more than 2 (two) years before the issuance date of the invitation for bids or request for proposals with respect to the contract under subsection (c) of this section.”
                Definitions for purposes of Section 136 determinations of eligibility—
                
                  Has been incorporated or legally organized means that the organization can show continuity as an ongoing business. Organizations that have changed only their names meet the continuity requirement of this subsection. Organizations that have been bought, sold, merged, or otherwise substantially altered or enlarged their principal business activities will have the burden of proving that there have been ongoing operations by the same business entity for the required period of time. If the successor entity has acquired all of the assets and liabilities of the predecessor entity and the predecessor entity has no further existence, the successor may claim the incorporation or legal organization date of the predecessor. In any other circumstance, the prospective offeror must show that the law of the jurisdiction in which it operates regards the prospective offeror as the complete successor in interest of the predecessor entity for purpose of contractual obligations.
                
                  Issuance date means the date in Block 5 of the Standard Form 33 accompanying this solicitation.
                
                  Years means calendar years measured from day of the month to day of the month. For example, January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 is one calendar year, as is July 1, 2002 through July 1, 2003.
                
                  Question 3:
                
                (i) On what date was the organization seeking eligibility incorporated or legally organized?
                
                (ii) If this date is less than two years before the issuance date, on the basis of what documentation does the organization seeking eligibility claim that it has been in business for the requisite period of time?

                Definitions for purposes of Section 136 determination of eligibility—

An entity whose only security services experience was performed by its legally distinct parent or subsidiary organization will not be considered to have security services experience.
                
                  Within the United States means within the legal geographic boundaries of a United States jurisdiction that is the place where the subject matter (e.g., services) of the contract or other arrangement was in fact completed. The place where the contract or other arrangement was negotiated or signed is not relevant to this definition.

                6. Section 136(d)(1): “The term ‘United States person’ means a person which “ (F)(i) employs United States citizens in at least 80 percent of its principal management positions in the United States; and (F)(ii) employs United States citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the United States.”

                (b) Each box shall be lined with waterproof paper and shall be bound with 19.05mm″ steel straps firmly stapled in position to prevent the straps from slipping off the box. Articles must be secured and braced inside the shipping container to prevent the articles from shifting.

                (c) Packing cases weighing 453.5kg and more must be equipped with skids. Each skid shall consist of two end sections of 50.8 × 152.4mm lumber placed flat and a center section of 50.8 × 101.6mm lumber placed flat and then arranged in line to provide 254mm forklift spaces between center and end sections. When goods are ready for shipment, the Contractor shall prepare four (4) copies of a packing list, indicating the contract and, if applicable, order numbers; case number; itemized list of contents; net and gross weights in kilograms; and outside dimensions, including all clears, of each shipping container. The Contractor shall provide three (3) copies of the packing list to the U.S. Despatch Agent as specified in the contract or order. The Contractor shall place the fourth copy of the packing list in packing case number one, which shall be marked as such so that it is easily identified by the consignee. Upon receipt of the packing list, the Despatch Agent will furnish export marks and instructions regarding shipment to the port specified, depending upon steamer services available at the time.
                (d) The export marks shall be stenciled on one side of each box reserved for that purpose, and the appropriate case number stenciled in the lower left-hand corner of the same side. The contract and, as necessary, order numbers, net and gross weights in kilograms shall be stenciled on the same side. However, if the size of the box is too small to accommodate all stenciling on one side, the contract and order numbers and weights may be stenciled on the side opposite that used for the export marks and case number.
                (e) The contract and, as necessary, order numbers must appear on all containers and papers relating to this clause.
