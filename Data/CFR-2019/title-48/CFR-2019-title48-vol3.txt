      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

      THIS TITLE
      Title 48—Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of seven volumes.

The contents of these volumes represent all current regulations codified under this title of the CFR as of October 1, 2019.

      The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal acquisition regulations.
      The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).
      The first volume, containing chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), includes an index to the Federal acquisition regulations.
      For this volume, Susannah C. Hurley was Chief Editor. The Code of Federal Regulations publication program is under the direction of John Hyrum Martinez, assisted by Stephen J. Frattini.

              Purpose.
              (1) The defense acquisition system, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2545, exists to manage the investments of the United States in technologies, programs, and product support necessary to achieve the national security strategy prescribed by the President pursuant to section 108 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3043) and to support the United States Armed Forces.
              (2) The investment strategy of DoD shall be postured to support not only the current United States armed forces, but also future armed forces of the United States.
              (3) The primary objective of DoD acquisition is to acquire quality supplies and services that satisfy user needs with measurable improvements to mission capability and operational support at a fair and reasonable price.

              (a)(i) 41 U.S.C. 1908(d) requires the adjustment for inflation of all statutory acquisition-related dollar thresholds in the DFARS be applied to contracts and subcontracts without regard to the date of award of the contract or subcontract, except thresholds based on the Wage Rate Requirements statute, the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, or established by the United States Trade Representative pursuant to the Trade Agreement Act, which are not escalated by the statute.
              (ii) Section 814(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Pub. L. 112-81) requires that the threshold established in 10 U.S.C. 2253(a)(2) for the acquisition of right-hand drive passenger sedans be included in the list of dollar thresholds that are subject to adjustment for inflation in accordance with the requirements of 41 U.S.C. 1908, and is adjusted pursuant to such provisions, as appropriate.

Process the proposed revision as a memorandum in the following format, addressed to the Director, DAR Council, OUSD(AT&L), 3060 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3060; datafax (571) 372-6094:
              
              
                I. PROBLEM: Succinctly state the problem created by current FAR and/or DFARS coverage and describe the factual and/or legal reasons necessitating the change to the regulation.
                II. Recommendation: Identify the FAR and/or DFARS citations to be revised. Attach as TAB A a copy of the text of the existing coverage, conformed to include the proposed additions and deletions. Indicate deleted coverage with dashed lines through the current words being deleted and insert proposed language in brackets at the appropriate locations within the existing coverage. If the proposed deleted portion is extensive, it may be outlined by lines forming a box with diagonal lines drawn connecting the corners.
                III. Discussion: Include a complete, convincing explanation of why the change is necessary and how the recommended revision will solve the problem. Address advantages and disadvantages of the proposed revision, as well as any cost or administrative impact on Government activities and contractors. Identify any potential impact of the change on automated systems, e.g., automated financial and procurement systems. Provide any other background information that would be helpful in explaining the issue.
                IV. Collaterals: Address the need for public comment (FAR 1.301(b) and subpart 1.5), the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (FAR 1.301(c)).
                V. Deviations: If a recommended revision of DFARS is a FAR deviation, identify the deviation and include under separate TAB a justification for the deviation that addresses the requirements of 201.402(2). The justification should be in the form of a memorandum for the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics).
              
              
              (ii) The public may offer proposed revisions of FAR or DFARS by submission of a memorandum, in the format (including all of the information) prescribed in paragraph (d)(i) of this subsection, to the Director of the DAR Council.

              Policy.
              (a)(1) DoD implementation and supplementation of the FAR is issued in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) under authorization and subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. The DFARS contains—
              (i) Requirements of law;
              (ii) DoD-wide policies;
              (iii) Delegations of FAR authorities;
              (iv) Deviations from FAR requirements; and
              (v) Policies/procedures that have a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DoD or a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.
              (2) Relevant procedures, guidance, and information that do not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are issued in the DFARS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI).
              (b) When Federal Register publication is required for any policy, procedure, clause, or form, the department or agency requesting Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)) approval for use of the policy, procedure, clause, or form (see 201.304(1)) must include an analysis of the public comments in the request for approval. Information on determining when a clause requires publication in the Federal Register and approval in accordance with 201.304(1) is provided at PGI 201.301(b).

              201.303
              Publication and codification.
              (a)(i) The DFARS is codified under chapter 2 in title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.
              (ii) To the extent possible, all DFARS text (whether implemental or supplemental) is numbered as if it were implemental. Supplemental numbering is used only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly with its FAR counterpart.

              (A) Implemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, except when the text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered by skipping a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. For example, three paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 219.501 (1), (2), and (3) rather than (a), (b), and (c). Three paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501(a) would be numbered 219.501(a) (i), (ii), and (iii) rather than (a) (1), (2), and (3). Further subdivision of the paragraphs follows the prescribed numbering sequence, e.g., 219.501(1)(i)(A)(1)(i).
              (B) Supplemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, with the addition of a number of 70 and up or (S-70) and up. Parts, subparts, sections, or subsections are supplemented by the addition of a number of 70 and up. Lower divisions are supplemented by the addition of a number of (S-70) and up. When text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered using the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed sequence, without skipping a unit. For example, DFARS text supplementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 219.501-70. Its subdivisions would be numbered 219.501-70 (a), (b), and (c).
              (C) Subdivision numbering below the 4th level does not repeat the numbering sequence. It uses italicized Arabic numbers and then italicized lower case Roman numerals.
              (D) An example of DFARS numbering is in Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.
              (iii) Department/agency and component supplements must parallel the FAR and DFARS numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.

              Agency control and compliance procedures.
              Departments and agencies and their component organizations may issue acquisition regulations as necessary to implement or supplement the FAR or DFARS.
              (1)(i) Approval of the USD (AT&L) is required before including in a department/agency or component supplement, or any other contracting regulation document such as a policy letter or clause book, any policy, procedure, clause, or form that—
              (A) Has a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency; or
              (B) Has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.
              (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this section, the USD(AT&L) has delegated authority to the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (OUSD(AT&L)DPAP) to approve or disapprove the policies, procedures, clauses, and forms subject to paragraph (1)(i) of this section.
              (2) In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1304, a new requirement for a certification by a contractor or offeror may not be included in a department/agency or component procurement regulation unless—

              (i) The certification requirement is specifically imposed by statute; or
              
              (ii) Written justification for such certification is provided to the Secretary of Defense by USD(AT&L), and the Secretary of Defense approves in writing the inclusion of such certification requirement.
              (3) Contracting activities must obtain the appropriate approval (see 201.404) for any class deviation (as defined in FAR subpart 1.4) from the FAR or DFARS, before its inclusion in a department/agency or component supplement or any other contracting regulation document such as a policy letter or clause book.
              (4) Each department and agency must develop and, upon approval by OUSD(AT&L)DPAP, implement, maintain, and comply with a plan for controlling the use of clauses other than those prescribed by FAR or DFARS. Additional information on department and agency clause control plan requirements is available at PGI 201.304(4).
              (5) Departments and agencies must submit requests for the Secretary of Defense, USD(AT&L), and OUSD(AT&L)DPAP approvals required by this section through the Director of the DAR Council. Procedures for requesting approval of department and agency clauses are provided at PGI 201.304(5).

                Offset means a benefit or obligation agreed to by a contractor and a foreign government or international organization as an inducement or condition to purchase supplies or services pursuant to a foreign military sale (FMS). There are two types of offsets: Direct offsets and indirect offsets.
              (1) A direct offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are directly related to the item(s) being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.

              (2) An indirect offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are not directly related to the specific item(s) being purchased and are not integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road or other facility. Indirect offsets would also include projects that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract (e.g., a project to develop or advance a capability, technology transfer, or know-how in a foreign company). Indirect offsets may be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.
              
                Offset costs means the costs to the contractor of providing any direct or indirect offsets required (explicitly or implicitly) as a condition of a foreign military sale.

              Department of the Navy—Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition);
              Department of the Air Force—Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition).

              To ensure the separation of functions for oversight, source selection, contract negotiation, and contract award, departments and agencies shall adhere to the following best practice policies:
              (a) Senior leaders shall not perform multiple roles in source selection for a major weapon system or major service acquisition.
              (b) Vacant acquisition positions shall be filled on an “acting” basis from below until a permanent appointment is made. To provide promising professionals an opportunity to gain experience by temporarily filling higher positions, these oversight duties shall not be accrued at the top.
              (c) Acquisition process reviews of the military departments shall be conducted to assess and improve acquisition and management processes, roles, and structures. The scope of the reviews should include—
              (1) Distribution of acquisition roles and responsibilities among personnel;
              (2) Processes for reporting concerns about unusual or inappropriate actions; and
              (3) Application of DoD Instruction 5000.2, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, and the disciplines in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook.
              (d) Source selection processes shall be—

              (1) Reviewed and approved by cognizant organizations responsible for oversight;
              
              (2) Documented by the head of the contracting activity or at the agency level; and
              (3) Periodically reviewed by outside officials independent of that office or agency.
              (e) Legal review of documentation of major acquisition system source selection shall be conducted prior to contract award, including the supporting documentation of the source selection evaluation board, source selection advisory council, and source selection authority.
              (f) Procurement management reviews shall determine whether clearance threshold authorities are clear and that independent review is provided for acquisitions exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.

              (a) A DoD official covered by the requirements of Section 847 of Public Law 110-181 (a “covered DoD official”) who, within 2 years after leaving DoD service, expects to receive compensation from a DoD contractor, shall, prior to accepting such compensation, request a written opinion from the appropriate DoD ethics counselor regarding the applicability of post-employment restrictions to activities that the official may undertake on behalf of a contractor.
              (b) A DoD contractor may not knowingly provide compensation to a covered DoD official within 2 years after the official leaves DoD service unless the contractor first determines that the official has received, or has requested at least 30 days prior to receiving compensation from the contractor, the post-employment ethics opinion described in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) If a DoD contractor knowingly fails to comply with the requirements of the clause at 252.203-7000, administrative and contractual actions may be taken, including cancellation of a procurement, rescission of a contract, or initiation of suspension or debarment proceedings.

              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart applies to DoD instead of FAR subpart 3.9.
              (1) This subpart implements 10 U.S.C. 2409 as amended by section 846 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Pub.

              203.903
              Policy.
              (1) Prohibition. 10 U.S.C. 2409 prohibits contractors and subcontractors from discharging, demoting, or otherwise discriminating against an employee as a reprisal for disclosing, to any of the entities listed at paragraph (3) of this section, information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a DoD contract, a gross waste of DoD funds, an abuse of authority relating to a DoD contract, a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a DoD contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract), or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Such reprisal is prohibited even if it is undertaken at the request of an executive branch official, unless the request takes the form of a non-discretionary directive and is within the authority of the executive branch official making the request.
              (2) Classified information. As provided in section 827(h) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, nothing in this subpart provides any rights to disclose classified information not otherwise provided by law.
              (3) Entities to whom disclosure may be made:
              (i) A Member of Congress or a representative of a committee of Congress.
              (ii) An Inspector General that receives funding from or has oversight over contracts awarded for or on behalf of DoD.
              (iii) The Government Accountability Office.

              (vi) A court or grand jury.
              (vii) A management official or other employee of the contractor or subcontractor who has the responsibility to investigate, discover, or address misconduct.
              (4) Disclosure clarified. An employee who initiates or provides evidence of contractor or subcontractor misconduct in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to waste, fraud, or abuse on a DoD contract shall be deemed to have made a disclosure.
              (5) Contracting officer actions. A contracting officer who receives a complaint of reprisal of the type described in paragraph (1) of this section shall forward it to legal counsel or to the appropriate party in accordance with agency procedures.

              (2) A complaint may not be brought under this section more than three years after the date on which the alleged reprisal took place.
              (3) The complaint shall be signed and shall contain—
              (i) The name of the contractor;
              (ii) The contract number, if known; if not, a description reasonably sufficient to identify the contract(s) involved;
              (iii) The violation of law, rule, or regulation giving rise to the disclosure;
              (iv) The nature of the disclosure giving rise to the discriminatory act, including the party to whom the information was disclosed; and
              (v) The specific nature and date of the reprisal.

              (1) Unless the DoD Inspector General makes a determination that the complaint is frivolous, fails to allege a violation of the prohibition in 203.903, or has been previously addressed in another Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding initiated by the complainant, the DoD Inspector General will investigate the complaint.
              (2) If the DoD Inspector General investigates the complaint, the DoD Inspector General will—
              (i) Notify the complainant, the contractor alleged to have committed the violation, and the head of the agency; and
              (ii) Provide a written report of findings to the complainant, the contractor alleged to have committed the violation, and the head of the agency.
              (3) Upon completion of the investigation, the DoD Inspector General—
              (i) Either will determine that the complaint is frivolous, fails to allege a violation of the prohibition in 203.903, or has been previously addressed in another Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding initiated by the complainant, or will submit the report addressed in paragraph (2) of this section within 180 days after receiving the complaint; and
              (ii) If unable to submit a report within 180 days, will submit the report within the additional time period, up to 180 days, as agreed to by the person submitting the complaint.
              (4) The DoD Inspector General may not respond to any inquiry or disclose any information from or about any person alleging the reprisal, except to the extent that such response or disclosure is—
              (i) Made with the consent of the person alleging reprisal;
              (ii) Made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a (the Freedom of Information Act) or as required by any other applicable Federal law; or
              (iii) Necessary to conduct an investigation of the alleged reprisal.
              (5) The legal burden of proof specified at paragraph (e) of 5 U.S.C. 1221 (Individual Right of Action in Certain Reprisal Cases) shall be controlling for the purposes of an investigation conducted by the DoD Inspector General, decision by the head of an agency, or judicial or administrative proceeding to determine whether prohibited discrimination has occurred.

              203.906
              Remedies.
              (1) Not later than 30 days after receiving a DoD Inspector General report in accordance with 203.905, the head of the agency shall determine whether sufficient basis exists to conclude that the contractor has subjected the complainant to a reprisal as prohibited by 203.903 and shall either issue an order denying relief or shall take one or more of the following actions:
              (i) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.
              (ii) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with compensatory damages (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.
              (iii) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the agency.
              (2) If the head of the agency issues an order denying relief or has not issued an order within 210 days after the submission of the complaint or within 30 days after the expiration of an extension of time granted in accordance with 203.905(3)(ii), and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant—
              (i) The complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with respect to the complaint; and

              (ii) The complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against the contractor to seek compensatory damages and other relief available under 10 U.S.C. 2409 in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury. An action under this authority may not be brought more than two years after the date on which remedies are deemed to have been exhausted.
              
              (3) An Inspector General determination and an agency head order denying relief under paragraph (2) of this section shall be admissible in evidence in any de novo action at law or equity brought pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2409(c).
              (4) Whenever a contractor fails to comply with an order issued by the head of agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2409, the head of the agency or designee shall request the Department of Justice to file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the agency.
              (5) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued by the head of the agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2409 may obtain judicial review of the order's conformance with the law, and the implementing regulation, in the United States Court of Appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency or designee. Review shall conform to Chapter 7 of Title 5, Unites States Code. Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order by the head of an agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.
              (6) The rights and remedies provided for in this subpart may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.

              Policy.

              (a) The Electronic Data Access (EDA) system, an online repository for contractual instruments and supporting documents, is DoD's primary tool for electronic distribution of contract documents and contract data. Contract attachments shall be uploaded to EDA, except for contract attachments that are classified, are too sensitive for widespread distribution (e.g., personally identifiable information and Privacy Act and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or cannot be practicably converted to electronic format (e.g., samples, drawings, and models). Section J (or similar location when the Uniform Contract Format is not used) shall include the annotation “provided under separate cover” for any attachment not uploaded to EDA.
              (b) Agencies are responsible for ensuring the following when posting documents, including contractual instruments, to EDA—
              (1) The timely distribution of documents; and
              (2) That internal controls are in place to ensure that—
              (i) The electronic version of a contract document in EDA is an accurate representation of the contract; and
              (ii) The contract data in EDA is an accurate representation of the underlying contract.

              (c) The procedures at PGI 204.270-2(c) provide details on the creation and processing of contract deficiency reports, which are used to correct problems with contracts distributed in EDA.

              (a) Use the clause at 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information, in solicitations and contracts when the contractor will have access to or generate unclassified information that may be sensitive and inappropriate for release to the public.
              (b) Use the clause at 252.204-7003, Control of Government Personnel Work Product, in all solicitations and contracts.

              204.470-1
              General.
              Under the U.S.-International Atomic Energy Agency Additional Protocol (U.S.-IAEA AP), the United States is required to declare a wide range of public and private nuclear-related activities to the IAEA and potentially provide access to IAEA inspectors for verification purposes.

              National security exclusion.
              (a) The U.S.-IAEA AP permits the United States unilaterally to declare exclusions from inspection requirements for activities, or locations or information associated with such activities, with direct national security significance.
              (b) In order to ensure that all relevant activities are reviewed for direct national security significance, both current and former activities, and associated locations or information, are to be considered for applicability for a national security exclusion.
              (c) If a DoD program manager receives notification from a contractor that the contractor is required to report any of its activities in accordance with the U.S.-IAEA AP, the program manager will—
              (1) Conduct a security assessment to determine if, and by what means, access may be granted to the IAEA; or
              (2) Provide written justification to the component or agency treaty office for application of the national security exclusion at that location to exclude access by the IAEA, in accordance with DoD Instruction 2060.03, Application of the National Security Exclusion to the Agreements Between the United States of America and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in the United States of America.

              (a) Any fissionable materials (e.g., uranium, plutonium, neptunium, thorium, americium);
              (b) Other radiological source materials; or

              Responsibilities.
              (1) The process for reporting contract actions to FPDS should, where possible, be automated by incorporating it into contract writing systems.
              (2) Data in FPDS is stored indefinitely and is electronically retrievable. Therefore, the contracting officer may reference the contract action report (CAR) approval date in the associated Government contract file instead of including a paper copy of the electronically submitted CAR in the file. Such reference satisfies contract file documentation requirements of FAR 4.803(a).

              (3) By December 15th of each year, the chief acquisition officer of each DoD component required to report its contract actions shall submit to the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, its annual certification and data validation results for the preceding fiscal year in accordance with the DoD Data Improvement Plan requirements at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb. The Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, will submit a consolidated DoD annual certification to the Office of Management and Budget by January 5th of each year.

              Contract files.

              (a) Any document posted to the Electronic Data Access (EDA) system is part of the contract file and is accessible by multiple parties, including the contractor. Do not include in EDA contract documents that are classified, too sensitive for widespread distribution (e.g., personally identifiable information and Privacy Act and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), or attachments that cannot be practicably converted to electronic format (e.g., samples, drawings, and models). Inclusion of any document in EDA other than contracts, modifications, and orders is optional.
              (f) A photocopy, facsimile, electronic, mechanically-applied and printed signature, seal, and date are considered to be an original signature, seal, and date.

              Closeout of contract files.
              (1) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this section, contracting officers  shall close out contracts in accordance with the procedures at PGI 204.804. The closeout date for file purposes shall be determined and documented by the procuring contracting officer.

              (2) The head of the contracting activity shall assign the highest priority to closeout of contracts awarded for performance in a contingency area. Heads of contracting activities shall monitor and assess on a regular basis the progress of contingency contract closeout activities and take appropriate steps if a backlog occurs. For guidance on the planning and execution of closing out such contracts, see PGI 207.105(b)(20)(C)(8) and PGI 225.373(e).
              (3)(i) In accordance with section 836 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub. L. 114-328) and section 824 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L. 115-91), contracting officers may close out contracts or groups of contracts through issuance of one or more modifications to such contracts without completing a reconciliation audit or other corrective action in accordance with FAR 4.804-5(a)(3) through (15), as appropriate, if each contract—
              (A) Was entered into on a date that is at least 17 fiscal years before the current fiscal year;
              (B) Has no further supplies or services due under the terms of the contract; and
              (C) Has been determined by a contracting official, at least one level above the contracting officer, to be not otherwise reconcilable, because—
              (1) The contract or related payment records have been destroyed or lost; or
              (2) Although contract or related payment records are available, the time or effort required to establish the exact amount owed to the U.S. Government or amount owed to the contractor is disproportionate to the amount at issue.
              (ii) Any contract or group of contracts meeting the requirements of paragraph (3)(i) of this section may be closed out through a negotiated settlement with the contractor. Except as provided in paragraph (3)(ii)(B) of this section, the contract closeout process shall include a bilateral modification of the affected contract, including those contracts that are closed out in accordance with a negotiated settlement.
              (A) For a contract or groups of contracts, the contracting officer shall prepare a negotiation settlement memorandum that describes how the requirements of paragraph (3)(i) of this section have been met.
              (B) For a group of contracts, a bilateral modification of at least one contract shall be made to reflect the negotiated settlement for a group of contracts, and unilateral modifications may be made, as appropriate, to other contracts in the group to reflect the negotiated settlement.
              (iii) For contract closeout actions under paragraph (3) of this section, remaining contract balances—
              (A) May be offset with balances in other contract line items within the same contract, regardless of the year or type of appropriation obligated to fund each contract line item and regardless of whether the appropriation obligated to fund such contract line item has closed; and
              (B) May be offset with balances on other contracts, regardless of the year or type of appropriations obligated to fund each contract and regardless of whether such appropriations have closed.
              (iv) USD(A&S) is authorized to waive any provision of acquisition law or regulation in order to carry out the closeout procedures authorized in paragraph (3)(i) of this section (see procedures at PGI 204.804(3)(iv).

              Disposal of contract files.
              (1) The sources of the period for which contract files must be retained are General Records Schedule 3 (Procurement, Supply, and Grant Records) and General Records Schedule 6 (Accountable Officers' Accounts Records). Copies of the General Records Schedule may be obtained from the National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC 20408.
              (2) Deviations from the periods cannot be granted by the Defense Acquisition Regulatory Council. Forward requests for deviations to both the Government Accountability Office and the National Archives and Records Administration.
              (3) Hold completed contract files in the office responsible for maintaining them for a period of 12 months after completion. After the initial 12 month period, send the records to the local records holding or staging area until they are eligible for destruction. If no space is available locally, transfer the files to the General Services Administration Federal Records Center that services the area.
              (4) Duplicate or working contract files should contain no originals of materials that properly belong in the official files. Destroy working files as soon as practicable once they are no longer needed.
              (5) Retain pricing review files, containing documents related to reviews of the contractor's price proposals, subject to certified cost or pricing data (see FAR 15.403-4), for six years. If it is impossible to determine the final payment date in order to measure the six year period, retain the files for nine years.

              Policy.
              (a) Establishment of a Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID). Do not reuse a PIID once it has been assigned. Do not assign the same PIID to more than one task or delivery order, even if they are issued under different base contracts or agreements.
              (b) Transition of PIID numbering. Effective October 1, 2016, all DoD components shall comply with the PIID numbering requirements of FAR subpart 4.16 and this subpart for all new solicitations, contracts, orders, and agreements issued, and any amendments and modifications to those new actions. See also PGI 204.1601(b).
              (c) Change in the PIID after its assignment. When a PIID is changed after contract award, the new PIID is known as a continued contract.
              (i) A continued contract—
              (A) Does not constitute a new procurement;
              (B) Incorporates all prices, terms, and conditions of the predecessor contract effective at the time of issuance of the continued contract;
              (C) Operates as a separate contract independent of the predecessor contract once issued; and
              (D) Shall not be used to evade competition requirements, expand the scope of work, or extend the period of performance beyond that of the predecessor contract.
              (ii) When issuing a continued contract, the contracting officer shall—
              (A) Issue an administrative modification to the predecessor contract to clearly state that—
              (1) Any future awards provided for under the terms of the predecessor contract (e.g., issuance of orders or exercise of options) will be accomplished under the continued contract; and
              (2) Supplies and services already acquired under the predecessor contract shall remain solely under that contract for purposes of Government inspection, acceptance, payment, and closeout; and
              (B) Follow the procedures at PGI 204.1601(c).
            
            
              204.1603
              Procedures.
              (a) Elements of a PIID. DoD-issued PIIDs are thirteen characters in length. Use only alpha-numeric characters, as prescribed in FAR 4.1603 and this subpart. Do not use the letter I or O in any part of the PIID.
              (3) Position 9.
              
              (A) DoD will use three of the letters reserved for departmental or agency use in FAR 4.1603(a)(3) in this position as follows:
              (1) Use M to identify purchase orders and task or delivery orders issued by the enterprise FedMall system.
              (2) Use S to identify broad agency announcements.
              (3) Use T to identify automated requests for quotations by authorized legacy contract writing systems. See PGI 204.1603(a)(3)(A)(3) for the list of authorized systems.
              (B) Do not use other letters identified in FAR 4.1603(a)(3) as “Reserved for future Federal Governmentwide use” or “Reserved for departmental or agency use” in position 9 of the PIID.
              (C) Do not use the letter C or H for contracts or agreements with provisions for orders or calls.
              (4) Positions 10 through 17. In accordance with FAR 4.1603(a)(4), DoD-issued PIIDs shall only use positions 10 through 13 to complete the PIID. Enter the serial number of the instrument in these positions. A separate series of serial numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed in FAR 4.1603(a)(3). DoD components assign such series of PIID numbers sequentially. A DoD component may reserve blocks of numbers or alpha-numeric numbers for use by its various activities.
              (b) Elements of a supplementary PIID. In addition to the supplementary PIID numbering procedures in FAR 4.1603(b), follow the procedures contained in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(1) and (2) of this section. See PGI 204.1603(b) for examples of proper supplementary PIID numbering.
              (2)(ii) Positions 2 through 6. In accordance with FAR 4.1603(b)(2)(ii), DoD-issued supplementary PIIDs shall, for positions 2 through 6 of modifications to contracts and agreements, comply with the following:
              
              (1) Positions 2 and 3. These two digits may be either alpha or numeric characters, except—
              (i) Use K, L, M, N, P, and Q only in position 2, and only if the modification is issued by the Air Force and is a provisioned item order;
              (ii) Use S only in position 2, and only to identify modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions when—
              (a) The contract has either FOB origin or destination delivery terms; and
              (b) The price changes;
              (iii) Use T, U, V, W, X, or Y only in position 2, and only to identify modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions when—
              (a) The contract has FOB origin delivery terms; and
              (b) The price does not change; and
              (iv) Use Z only in position 2, and only to identify a modification which definitizes a letter contract or a previously issued undefinitized modification.
              (2) Positions 4 through 6. These positions are always numeric. Use a separate series of serial numbers for each type of modification listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

              Order of application for modifications.
              (a) Circumstances may exist in which the numeric order of the modifications to a contract is not the order in which the changes to the contract actually take effect.
              (b) In order to determine the sequence of modifications to a contract or order, the modifications will be applied in the following order—
              (1) Modifications will be applied in order of the effective date on the modification;
              (2) In the event of two or more modifications with the same effective date, modifications will be applied in signature date order; and
              (3) In the event of two or more modifications with the same effective date and the same signature date, procuring contracting office modifications will be applied in numeric order, followed by contract administration office modifications in numeric order.

            Subpart 204.71—Uniform Contract Line Item Numbering System
            
              204.7100
              Scope.
              This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for assigning contract line item numbers.
            
            
              204.7101
              Definitions.
              
                Accounting classification reference number (ACRN) means any combination of a two position alpha/numeric code used as a method of relating the accounting classification citation to detailed line item information contained in the schedule.
              
                Attachment means any documentation, appended to a contract or incorporated by reference, which does not establish a requirement for deliverables.
              
                Definitized item, as used in this subpart, means an item for which a firm price has been established in the basic contract or by modification.
              
                Exhibit means a document, referred to in a contract, which is attached and establishes requirements for deliverables. The term shall not be used to refer to any other kind of attachment to a contract. The DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, is always an exhibit, rather than an attachment.
              
              
                Nonseverable deliverable, as used in this subpart, means a deliverable item that is a single end product or undertaking, entire in nature, that cannot be feasibly subdivided into discrete elements or phases without losing its identity.
              
                Undefinitized item, as used in this subpart, means an item for which a price has not been established in the basic contract or by modification.

              204.7102
              Policy.
              (a) The numbering procedures of this subpart shall apply to all—
              (1) Solicitations;
              (2) Solicitation line and subline item numbers;
              (3) Contracts as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1;
              (4) Contract line and subline item numbers;
              (5) Exhibits;
              (6) Exhibit line items; and
              (7) Any other document expected to become part of the contract.
              (b) The numbering procedures are mandatory for all contracts where separate contract line item numbers are assigned, unless—
              (1) The contract is an indefinite-delivery type for petroleum products against which posts, camps, and stations issue delivery orders for products to be consumed by them; or
              (2) The contract is a communications service authorization issued by the Defense Information Systems Agency's Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization.

              204.7103-1
              Criteria for establishing.
              Contracts shall identify the items or services to be acquired as separate contract line items unless it is not feasible to do so.
              (a) Contract line items shall have all four of the following characteristics; however, there are exceptions within the characteristics, which may make establishing a separate contract line item appropriate even though one of the characteristics appears to be missing—
              (1) Single unit price. The item shall have a single unit price or a single total price, except—
              (i) If the item is not separately priced (NSP) but the price is included in the unit price of another contract line item, enter NSP instead of the unit price;
              (ii) When there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items are priced in accordance with 204.7104;
              (iii) When the items or services are being acquired on a cost-reimbursement contract;
              (iv) When the contract is for maintenance and repair services (e.g., a labor hour contract) and firm prices have been established for elements of the total price of an item but the actual number and quantity of the elements are not known until performance. The contracting officer may structure these contracts to reflect a firm or estimated total amount for each line item;
              (v) When the contract line item is established to refer to an exhibit or an attachment (if management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block and enclosed in parentheses); or
              (vi) When the contract is an indefinite delivery type contract and provides that the price of an item shall be determined at the time a delivery order is placed and the price is influenced by such factors as the quantity ordered (e.g., 10-99 @ $1.00, 100-249 @ $.98, 250+ @ $.95), the destination, the FOB point, or the type of packaging required.
              (2) Separately identifiable. A contract line item must be identified separately from any other items or services on the contract.
              (i) Supplies are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—
              (A) National stock number (NSN);
              (B) Item description; or
              
              (C) Manufacturer's part number.
              (ii) Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—
              (A) Scope of work; or
              (B) Description of services.
              (iii) This requirement does not apply if there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items include the actual detailed identification in accordance with 204.7104. Where this exception applies, use a general narrative description instead of the contract item description.
              (3) Separate delivery schedule. Each contract line item or service shall have its own delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date expressly stated (“as required” constitutes an expressly stated delivery term).
              (i) The fact that there is more than one delivery date, destination, performance date, or performance point may be a determining factor in the decision as to whether to establish more than one contract line item.
              (ii) If a contract line item has more than one destination or delivery date, the contracting officer may create individual contract line items for the different destinations or delivery dates, or may specify the different delivery dates for the units by destination in the delivery schedule.
              (4) Single accounting classification citation. (i) Each contract line item shall reference a single accounting classification citation except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this subsection.
              (ii) The use of multiple accounting classification citations for a contract line item is authorized in the following situations:
              (A) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with R&D or other funds properly incrementally obligated over several fiscal years in accordance with DoD policy;
              (B) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with different authorizations or appropriations, such as in the acquisition of a satellite or the modification of production tooling used to produce items being acquired by several activities; or
              (C) A modification to an existing contract line item for a nonseverable deliverable that results in the delivery of a modified item(s) where the item(s) and modification are to be paid for with different accounting classification citations.
              (iii) When the use of multiple accounting classification citations is authorized for a single contract line item, establish informational subline items for each accounting classification citation in accordance with 204.7104-1(a).
              (b) All subline items and exhibit line items under one contract line item shall be the same contract type as the contract line item.
              (c) For a contract that contains a combination of fixed-price line items, time-and-materials/labor-hour line items, and/or cost-reimbursement line items, identify the contract type for each contract line item in Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs, to facilitate appropriate payment.
              (d) Exhibits may be used as an alternative to putting a long list of contract line items in the schedule. If exhibits are used, create a contract line item citing the exhibit's identifier. See 204.7105.
              (e) If the contract involves a test model or a first article which must be approved, establish a separate contract line item or subline item for each item of supply or service which must be approved. If the test model or first article consists of a lot composed of a mixture of items, a single line item or subline item may be used for the lot.
              (f) If a supply or service involves ancillary functions, like packaging and handling, transportation, payment of state or local taxes, or use of reusable containers, and these functions are normally performed by the contractor and the contractor is normally entitled to reimbursement for performing these functions, do not establish a separate contract line item solely to account for these functions. However, do identify the functions in the contract schedule. If the offeror separately prices these functions, contracting officers may establish separate contract line items for the functions; however, the separate line items must conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection.

              (g) Certain commercial items and initial provisioning spares for weapons systems are requested and subsequently solicited using units of measure such as kit, set, or lot. However, there are times when individual items within that kit, set, or lot are not grouped and delivered in a single shipment. This creates potential contract administration issues with inspection, acceptance, and payment. In such cases, solicitations should be structured to allow offerors to provide information about products that may not have been known to the Government prior to solicitation and propose an alternate line item structure as long as the alternate is consistent with the requirements of 204.71, which provides explicit guidance on the use of contract line items and subline items, and with PGI 204.71.

              204.7104
              Contract subline items.
            
            
              204.7104-1
              Criteria for establishing.
              Contract subline items provide flexibility to further identify elements within a contract line item for tracking performance or simplifying administration. There are only two kinds of subline items: those which are informational in nature and those which consist of more than one item that requires separate identification.
              (a) Informational subline items. (1) This type of subline item identifies information that relates directly to the contract line item and is an integral part of it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a kit). These subline items shall not be scheduled separately for delivery, identified separately for shipment or performance, or priced separately for payment purposes.
              (2) The informational subline item may include quantities, prices, or amounts, if necessary to satisfy management requirements. However, these elements shall be included within the item description in the supplies/services column and enclosed in parentheses to prevent confusing them with quantities, prices, or amounts that have contractual significance. Do not enter these elements in the quantity and price columns.
              (3) Informational subline items shall be used to identify each accounting classification citation assigned to a single contract line item number when use of multiple citations is authorized (see 204.7103-1(a)(4)(ii)).
              (b) Separately identified subline items. (1) Subline items will be used instead of contract line items to facilitate payment, delivery tracking, contract funds accounting, or other management purposes. Such subline items shall be used when items bought under one contract line item number—
              (i) Are to be paid for from more than one accounting classification. A subline item shall be established for the quantity associated with the single accounting classification citation. Establish a line item rather than a subline item if it is likely that a subline item may be assigned additional accounting classification citations at a later date. Identify the funding as described in 204.7104-1(a)(3);
              (ii) Are to be packaged in different sizes, each represented by its own NSN;
              (iii) Have collateral costs, such as packaging costs, but those costs are not a part of the unit price of the contract line item;
              (iv) Have different delivery dates or destinations or requisitions, or a combination of the three; or
              (v) Identify parts of an assembly or kit which—
              (A) Have to be separately identified at the time of shipment or performance; and
              (B) Are separately priced.
              (2) Each separately identified contract subline item shall have its own—
              (i) Delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date;
              (ii) Unit price or single total price or amount (not separately priced (NSP) is acceptable as an entry for price or amount if the price is included in another subline item or a different contract line item). This requirement does not apply—

              (A) If the subline item was created to refer to an exhibit or an attachment. If management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block of the schedule and enclosed in parentheses; or
              (B) In the case of indefinite delivery contracts described at 204.7103-1(a)(1)(vi).
              (iii) Identification (e.g., NSN, item description, manufacturer's part number, scope of work, description of services).
              (3) Unit prices and extended amounts.
              (i) The unit price and total amount for all subline items may be entered at the contract line item number level if the unit price for the subline items is identical. If there is any variation, the subline item unit prices shall be entered at the subline item level only.
              (ii) The unit price and extended amounts may be entered at the subline items level.
              (iii) The two methods in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this subsection shall not be combined in a contract line item.
              (iv) When the price for items not separately priced is included in the price of another subline item or contract line item, it may be necessary to withhold payment on the priced subline item until all the related subline items that are not separately priced have been delivered. In those cases, use the clause at 252.204-7002, Payment for Subline Items Not Separately Priced.

              Contract modifications.
              (a) If new items are added, assign new contract line or subline item numbers or exhibit line item numbers, in accordance with the procedures established at 204.7103, 204.7104, and 204.7105.
              (b) Modifications to existing contract line items or exhibit line items. (1) If the modification relates to existing contract line items or exhibit line items, the modification shall refer to those item numbers.
              (2) If the contracting officer decides to assign new identifications to existing contract or exhibit line items, the following rules apply—
              (i) Definitized and undefinitized items. (A) The original line item or subline item number may be used if the modification applies to the total quantity of the original line item or subline.
              (B) The original line item or subline item number may be used if the modification makes only minor changes in the specifications of some of the items ordered on the original line item or subline item and the resulting changes in unit price can be averaged to provide a new single unit price for the total quantity. If the changes in the specifications make the item significantly distinguishable from the original item or the resulting changes in unit price cannot be averaged, create a new line item.
              (C) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item and the change does not involve either the delivery date or the ship-to/mark-for data, the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number shall remain with the unchanged quantity. Assign the changed quantity the next available number.
              (ii) Undefinitized items. In addition to the rules in paragraph (b)(2)(i), the following additional rules apply to undefinitized items—
              (A) If the modification is undefinitized and increases the quantity of an existing definitized item, assign the undefinitized quantity the next available number.

              (B) If the modification increases the quantity of an existing undefinitized item, the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item may be used if the unit price for the new quantity is expected to be the same as the price for the original quantity. If the unit prices of the two quantities will be different, assign the new quantity the next available number.
              (C) If the modification both affects only a partial quantity of the existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item and definitizes the price for the affected portion, the definitized portion shall retain the original item number. If there is any undefinitized portion of the item, assign it the next available number. However, if the modification definitizes the price for the whole quantity of the line item, and price impact of the changed work can be apportioned equally over the whole to arrive at a new unit price, the quantity with the changes can be added into the quantity of the existing item.
              (D) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item but does not change the delivery schedule or definitize price, the unchanged portion shall retain the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number. Assign the changed portion the next available number.
              (3) If the modification will decrease the amount obligated—
              (i) There shall be coordination between the administrative and procuring contracting offices before issuance of the modification; and
              (ii) The contracting officer shall not issue the modification unless sufficient unliquidated obligation exists or the purpose is to recover monies owed to the Government.

                Covered contractor information system means an unclassified information system that is owned, or operated by or for, a contractor and that processes, stores, or transmits covered defense information.
              
                Covered defense information means unclassified controlled technical information or other information (as described in the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Registry at http://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/category-list.html) that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Governmentwide policies, and is—
              (1) Marked or otherwise identified in the contract, task order, or delivery order and provided to the contractor by or on behalf of DoD in support of the performance of the contract; or

              (2) Collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on behalf of the contractor in support of the performance of the contract.
              
              
                Information system means a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.
              
                Media means physical devices or writing surfaces including, but not limited to, magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, large-scale integration memory chips, and printouts onto which covered defense information is recorded, stored, or printed within a covered contractor information system.
              
                Rapidly report means within 72 hours of discovery of any cyber incident.
              
                Technical information means technical data or computer software, as those terms are defined in the clause at DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Non Commercial Items, regardless of whether or not the clause is incorporated in this solicitation or contract. Examples of technical information include research and engineering data, engineering drawings, and associated lists, specifications, standards, process sheets, manuals, technical reports, technical orders, catalog-item identifications, data sets, studies and analyses and related information, and computer software executable code and source code.

              Policy.
              (a) Contractors and subcontractors are required to provide adequate security on all covered contractor information systems.

              (b) Contractors and subcontractors are required to rapidly report cyber incidents directly to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil. Subcontractors provide the incident report number automatically assigned by DoD to the prime contractor. Lower-tier subcontractors likewise report the incident report number automatically assigned by DoD to their higher-tier subcontractor, until the prime contractor is reached.
              (1) If a cyber incident occurs, contractors and subcontractors submit to DoD—
              (i) A cyber incident report;
              (ii) Malicious software, if detected and isolated; and
              (iii) Media (or access to covered contractor information systems and equipment) upon request.
              (2) Contracting officers shall refer to PGI 204.7303-4(c) for instructions on contractor submissions of media and malicious software.
              (c) Information shared by the contractor may include contractor attributional/proprietary information that is not customarily shared outside of the company, and that the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information could cause substantial competitive harm to the contractor that reported the information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information.
              (d) A cyber incident that is reported by a contractor or subcontractor shall not, by itself, be interpreted as evidence that the contractor or subcontractor has failed to provide adequate security on their covered contractor information systems, or has otherwise failed to meet the requirements of the clause at 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting. When a cyber incident is reported, the contracting officer shall consult with the DoD component Chief Information Officer/cyber security office prior to assessing contractor compliance (see PGI 204.7303-3(a)(3)). The contracting officer shall consider such cyber incidents in the context of an overall assessment of a contractor's compliance with the requirements of the clause at 252.204-7012.

              (e) Support services contractors directly supporting Government activities related to safeguarding covered defense information and cyber incident reporting (e.g., forensic analysis, damage assessment,, or other services that require access to data from another contractor) are subject to restrictions on use and disclosure of reported information.

              (i) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2533a(k), contracting officers also must synopsize through the GPE, awards exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that are for the acquisition of any clothing, fiber, yarn, or fabric items described in 225.7002-1(a)(1)(ii) through (x), if—
              
              (A) The Secretary concerned has determined that domestic items are not available, in accordance with 225.7002-2(b); or
              (B) The acquisition is for chemical warfare protective clothing, and the contracting officer has determined that an exception to domestic source requirements applies because the acquisition furthers an agreement with a qualifying country, in accordance with 225.7002-2(n).
              (ii) The synopsis must be submitted in sufficient time to permit its publication not later than 7 days after contract award.
              (iii) In addition to the information otherwise required in a synopsis of contract award, the synopsis must include one of the following statements as applicable:

              (B) The Secretary of Defense provides Congress written notice of intent to award. The contract cannot be awarded until 180 days have elapsed since the date Congress received the notice of intent to award. Contracting activities must submit a draft notice of intent with supporting documentation through channels to the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics).
              (ii) The limitation in paragraph (c)(i) of this subsection applies only if the statute authorizing or requiring award was enacted after September 30, 1989.
              (iii) Subsequent statutes may provide different or additional constraints on the award of contracts to specified colleges and universities. Contracting officers should consult legal counsel on a case-by-case basis.

              Additional requirements for major systems.
              (b)(1)(A) The contracting officer is prohibited by 10 U.S.C. 2305(d)(4)(A) from requiring offers for development or production of major systems that would enable the Government to use technical data to competitively reprocure identical items or components of the system if the item or component were developed exclusively at private expense, unless the contracting officer determines that—
              (1) The original supplier of the item or component will be unable to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements;
              (2) Proposals by the original supplier of the item or component to meet mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency's mobilization needs; or
              (3) The Government is otherwise entitled to unlimited rights in technical data.

              (B) If the contracting officer makes a determination, under paragraphs (b)(1)(A) (1) and (2) of this section, for a competitive solicitation, 10 U.S.C. 2305(d)(4)(B) requires that the evaluation of items developed at private expense be based on an analysis of the total value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.
              (S-70)(1) In accordance with Section 802(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Pub. L. 109-364) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for major weapon systems and subsystems of major weapon systems shall—
              (i) Assess the long-term technical data and computer software needs of those systems and subsystems; and

              (ii) Establish acquisition strategies that provide for the technical data and computer software deliverables and associated license rights needed to sustain those systems and subsystems over their life cycle. The strategy may include—
              (A) The development of maintenance capabilities within DoD; or
              (B) Competition for contracts for sustainment of the systems or subsystems.
              (2) Assessments and corresponding acquisition strategies developed under this section shall—
              (i) Be developed before issuance of a solicitation for the weapon system or subsystem;
              (ii) Address the merits of including a priced contract option for the future delivery of technical data and computer software, and associated license rights, that were not acquired upon initial contract award;
              (iii) Address the potential for changes in the sustainment plan over the life cycle of the weapon system or subsystem; and
              (iv) Apply to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported by performance-based logistics arrangements as well as to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported by other sustainment approaches.
              (S-71) See 209.570 for policy applicable to acquisition strategies that consider the use of lead system integrators.
              (S-72)(1) In accordance with section 202 of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-23), acquisition plans for major defense acquisition programs as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2430, shall include measures that—
              (i) Ensure competition, or the option of competition, at both the prime contract level and subcontract level (at such tier or tiers as are appropriate) throughout the program life cycle as a means to improve contractor performance; and
              (ii) Document the rationale for the selection of the appropriate subcontract tier or tiers under paragraph (S-72)(1)(i) of this section, and the measures which will be employed to ensure competition, or the option of competition.
              (2) Measures to ensure competition, or the option of competition, may include, but are not limited to, cost-effective measures intended to achieve the following:
              (i) Competitive prototyping.
              (ii) Dual-sourcing.
              (iii) Unbundling of contracts.
              (iv) Funding of next-generation prototype systems or subsystems.
              (v) Use of modular, open architectures to enable competition for upgrades.
              (vi) Use of build-to-print approaches to enable production through multiple sources.
              (vii) Acquisition of complete technical data packages.
              (viii) Periodic competitions for subsystem upgrades.
              (ix) Licensing of additional suppliers.
              (x) Periodic system or program reviews to address long-term competitive effects of program decisions.
              (3) In order to ensure fair and objective “make-or-buy” decisions by prime contractors, acquisition strategies and resultant solicitations and contracts shall—
              (i) Require prime contractors to give full and fair consideration to qualified sources other than the prime contractor for the development or construction of major subsystems and components of major weapon systems;
              (ii) Provide for Government surveillance of the process by which prime contractors consider such sources and determine whether to conduct such development or construction in-house or through a subcontract; and
              (iii) Provide for the assessment of the extent to which the prime contractor has given full and fair consideration to qualified sources in sourcing decisions as a part of past performance evaluations.
              (4) Whenever a source-of-repair decision results in a plan to award a contract for the performance of maintenance and sustainment services on a major weapon system, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with statutory requirements, the acquisition plan shall prescribe that award will be made on a competitive basis after giving full consideration to all sources (including sources that partner or subcontract with public or private sector repair activities).

              (S-73) In accordance with section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for major weapons systems shall include a plan for the preservation and storage of special tooling associated with the production of hardware for major defense acquisition programs through the end of the service life of the related weapons system. The plan shall include the identification of any contract clauses, facilities, and funding required for the preservation and storage of such tooling. The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) may waive this requirement if USD (AT&L) determines that it is in the best interest of DoD.

              (a) This section provides policy for breaking out components of end items for future acquisitions so that the Government can purchase the components directly from the manufacturer or supplier and furnish them to the end item manufacturer as Government-furnished material.
              (b) This section does not apply to—
              (1) The initial decisions on Government-furnished equipment or contractor-furnished equipment that are made at the inception of an acquisition program; or
              (2) Breakout of parts for replenishment (see appendix E).

              Policy.
              DoD policy is to break out components of weapons systems or other major end items under certain circumstances.
              (a) When it is anticipated that a prime contract will be awarded without adequate price competition, and the prime contractor is expected to acquire any component without adequate price competition, the agency shall break out that component if—
              (1) Substantial net cost savings probably will be achieved; and
              (2) Breakout action will not jeopardize the quality, reliability, performance, or timely delivery of the end item.
              (b) Even when either or both the prime contract and the component will be acquired with adequate price competition, the agency shall consider breakout of the component if substantial net cost savings will result from—
              (1) Greater quantity acquisitions; or
              (2) Such factors as improved logistics support (through reduction in varieties of spare parts) and economies in operations and training (through standardization of design).
              (c) Breakout normally is not justified for a component that is not expected to exceed $1 million for the current year's requirement.

The contracting officer shall not enter into any contract for the lease or charter of any vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle, or any contract for services that would require the use of the contractor's vessel, aircraft, or combat vehicle, unless the Secretary of the military department concerned has satisfied the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2401, when—
              (1) The contract will be a long-term lease or charter as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2401(d)(1); or
              (2) The terms of the contract provide for a substantial termination liability as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2401(d)(2). Also see PGI 207.470.
              (b) Limitation on contracts with terms of 18 months or more. As required by 10 U.S.C. 2401a, the contracting officer shall not enter into any contract for any vessel, aircraft, or vehicle, through a lease, charter, or similar agreement with a term of 18 months or more, or extend or renew any such contract for a term of 18 months or more, unless the head of the contracting activity has—
              (1) Considered all costs of such a contract (including estimated termination liability); and
              (2) Determined in writing that the contract is in the best interest of the Government.
              (c) Leasing of commercial vehicles and associated equipment. Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the contracting officer may use leasing in the acquisition of commercial vehicles and associated equipment whenever the contracting officer determines that leasing of such vehicles is practicable and efficient (10 US.C. 2401a).

              207.7001
              Definition.
              
                End item, as used in this subpart, means a production product assembled, completed, and ready for issue or deployment.
            
            
              207.7002
              Authority to acquire additional quantities of end items.
              10 U.S.C. 2308 authorizes DoD to use funds available for the acquisition of an end item to acquire a higher quantity of the end item than the quantity specified in a law providing for the funding of that acquisition, if the head of an agency determines that—
              (a) The agency has an established requirement for the end item that is expected to remain substantially unchanged throughout the period of the acquisition;
              (b) It is possible to acquire the higher quantity of the end item without additional funding because of production efficiencies or other cost reductions;
              (c) The amount of funds used for the acquisition of the higher quantity of the end item will not exceed the amount provided under that law for the acquisition of the end item; and
              (d) The amount provided under that law for the acquisition of the end item is sufficient to ensure that each unit of the end item acquired within the higher quantity is fully funded as a complete end item.
            
            
              207.7003
              Limitation.
              For noncompetitive acquisitions, the acquisition of additional quantities is limited to not more than 10 percent of the quantity approved in the justification and approval prepared in accordance with FAR part 6 for the acquisition of the end item.

              208.7000
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart prescribes policy and procedures for acquisition of items for which contracting responsibility is assigned to one or more of the departments/agencies or the General Services Administration. Contracting responsibility is assigned through—
              (a) The Coordinated Acquisition Program (commodity assignments are listed in PGI 208.7006); or
              (b) The Integrated Materiel Management Program (assignments are in DoD 4140.26-M, Defense Integrated Materiel Management Manual for Consumable Items).
              [56 FR 36306, July 31, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 77936, Dec. 20, 2002; 71 FR 39004, July 11, 2006]
            
            
              208.7001
              Definitions.
              For purposes of this subpart—
              
                Acquiring department means the department, agency, or General Services Administration which has contracting responsibility under the Coordinated Acquisition Program.
              
                Integrated materiel management means assignment of acquisition management responsibility to one department, agency, or the General Services Administration for all of DoD's requirements for the assigned item. Acquisition management normally includes computing requirements, funding, budgeting, storing, issuing, cataloging, standardizing, and contracting functions.
              
              
                Requiring department means the department or agency which has the requirement for an item.
            
            
              208.7002
              Assignment authority.
              (a) Under the DoD Coordinated Acquisition Program, contracting responsibility for certain commodities is assigned to a single department, agency, or the General Services Administration (GSA). Commodity assignments are made—
              (1) To the departments and agencies, by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics);
              (2) To GSA, through agreement with GSA, by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics);
              (3) Outside the contiguous United States, by the Unified Commanders; and
              (4) For acquisitions to be made in the contiguous United States for commodities not assigned under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, by agreement of agency heads (10 U.S.C. 2311).
              (i) Agreement may be on either a one-time or a continuing basis. The submission of a military interdepartmental purchase request (MIPR) by a requiring activity and its acceptance by the contracting activity of another department, even though based on an oral communication, constitutes a one-time agreement.
              (ii) Consider repetitive delegated acquisition responsibilities for coordinated acquisition assignment. If not considered suitable for coordinated acquisition assignment, formalize continuing agreements and distribute them to all activities concerned.
              (b) Under the Integrated Materiel Management Program, assignments are made by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics)—
              (1) To the departments and agencies; and
              (2) To GSA, through agreement with GSA.

              Assignments under integrated materiel management (IMM).
              (a) Acquire all items assigned for IMM from the IMM manager except—
              (1) Items purchased under circumstances of unusual and compelling urgency as defined in FAR 6.302-2. After such a purchase is made, the requiring activity must send one copy of the contract and a statement of the emergency to the IMM manager;
              (2) Items for which the IMM manager assigns a supply system code for local purchase or otherwise grants authority to purchase locally; or
              (3) When purchase by the requiring activity is in the best interest of the Government in terms of the combination of quality, timeliness, and cost that best meets the requirement. This exception does not apply to items—
              (i) Critical to the safe operation of a weapon system;
              (ii) With special security characteristics; or
              (iii) Which are dangerous (e.g., explosives, munitions).
              (b) Follow the procedures at PGI 208.7003-1(b) when an item assigned for IMM is to be acquired by the requiring department in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection.

              208.7003-2
              Assignments under coordinated acquisition.

              Requiring departments must submit to the acquiring department all contracting requirements for items assigned for coordinated acquisition, except—
              
              (a) Items obtained through the sources in FAR 8.002(a)(1) (i) through (vii);
              (b) Items obtained under 208.7003-1(a);
              (c) Requirements not in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold in FAR part 2, when contracting by the requiring department is in the best interest of the Government;
              (d) In an emergency. When an emergency purchase is made, the requiring department must send one copy of the contract and a statement of the emergency to the contracting activity of the acquiring department;
              (e) Requirements for which the acquiring department's contracting activity delegates contracting authority to the requiring department;
              (f) Items in a research and development stage (as described in FAR part 35). Under this exception, the military departments may contract for research and development requirements, including quantities for testing purposes and items undergoing in-service evaluation (not yet in actual production, but beyond prototype). Generally, this exception applies only when research and development funds are used.
              (g) Items peculiar to nuclear ordnance material where design characteristics or test-inspection requirements are controlled by the Department of Energy (DoE) or by DoD to ensure reliability of nuclear weapons.
              (1) This exception applies to all items designed for and peculiar to nuclear ordnance regardless of agency control, or to any item which requires test or inspection conducted or controlled by DoE or DoD.
              (2) This exception does not cover items used for both nuclear ordnance and other purposes if the items are not subject to the special testing procedures.
              (h) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-6 (national security requires limitation of sources);
              (i) Items to be acquired under FAR 6.302-1 (supplies available only from the original source for follow-on contract);
              (j) Items directly related to a major system and which are design controlled by and acquired from either the system manufacturer or a manufacturer of a major subsystem;
              (k) Items subject to rapid design changes, or to continuous redesign or modification during the production and/or operational use phases, which require continual contact between industry and the requiring department to ensure that the item meets the requirements:
              (1) This exception permits the requiring department to contract for items of highly unstable design. For use of this exception, it must be clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the acquisition to the acquiring department. Anticipation that contracting by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes may occur during contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason for using this exception.
              (2) This exception also applies to items requiring compatibility testing, provided such testing requires continual contact between industry and the requiring department;
              (l) Containers acquired only with items for which they are designed;
              (m) One-time buy of a noncataloged item.
              (1) This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged item. This exception could cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at a later date.
              (2) This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only slightly different characteristics than previously cataloged items.

              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              
                Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP) means the Defense Logistics Agency field activity located at 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5096, which is the assigned commodity integrated material manager for refined precious metals and is responsible for the storage and issue of such material.
              
                Refined precious metal means recovered silver, gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, or ruthenium, in bullion, granulation or sponge form, which has been purified to at least .999 percentage of fineness.

              (b)(i) The Procurement Cause and Treatment Code “H” annotation in the Exclusions section of the System for Award Management (SAM Exclusions) identifies contractor facilities where no part of a contract or subcontract may be performed because of a violation of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7606) or the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368).
              (ii) Under the authority of Section 8 of Executive Order 11738, the agency head may grant an exemption permitting award to a contractor using a Code “H” ineligible facility if the agency head determines that such an exemption is in the paramount interest of the United States.
              (A) The agency head may delegate this exemption authority to a level no lower than a general or flag officer or a member of the Senior Executive Service.
              (B) The official granting the exemption—
              (1) Shall promptly notify the Environmental Protection Agency suspending and debarring official of the exemption and the corresponding justification; and

              (B) Other requirements the debarring official considers appropriate.
              (ii) Before the debarring official decides not to suspend or debar in the case of an indictment or conviction for a felony, the debarring official must determine that the contractor has addressed adequately the circumstances that gave rise to the misconduct, and that appropriate standards of ethics and integrity are in place and are working.

              Policy.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, 10 U.S.C. 2410p prohibits any entity performing lead system integrator functions in the acquisition of a major system by DoD from having any direct financial interest in the development or construction of any individual system or element of any system of systems.
              (b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this subsection does not apply if—
              (1) The Secretary of Defense certifies to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives that—
              (i) The entity was selected by DoD as a contractor to develop or construct the system or element concerned through the use of competitive procedures; and
              (ii) DoD took appropriate steps to prevent any organizational conflict of interest in the selection process; or
              (2) The entity was selected by a subcontractor to serve as a lower-tier subcontractor, through a process over which the entity exercised no control.
              (c) In accordance with Section 802 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Pub. L. 110-181), DoD may award a new contract for lead system integrator functions in the acquisition of a major system only if—
              (1) The major system has not yet proceeded beyond low-rate initial production; or

              (2) The Secretary of Defense determines in writing that it would not be practicable to carry out the acquisition without continuing to use a contractor to perform lead system integrator functions and that doing so is in the best interest of DoD. The authority to make this determination may not be delegated below the level of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. (Also see 209.570-3(b).)
              (d) Effective October 1, 2010, DoD is prohibited from awarding a new contract for lead system integrator functions in the acquisition of a major system to any entity that was not performing lead system integrator functions in the acquisition of the major system prior to January 28, 2008.

              (i) Lead system integrator with system responsibility means a prime contractor for the development or production of a major system, if the prime contractor is not expected at the time of award to perform a substantial portion of the work on the system and the major subsystems.
              (ii) Lead system integrator without system responsibility means a prime contractor under a contract for the procurement of services, the primary purpose of which is to perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions (see section 7.503(d) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) with respect to the development or production of a major system.
              “Major subcontractor” means a subcontractor that is awarded a subcontract that equals or exceeds—
              (i) Both the certified cost or pricing data threshold and 10 percent of the value of the contract under which the subcontract is awarded; or
              (ii) $55 million.
              “Pre-Major Defense Acquisition Program” means a program that is in the Materiel Solution Analysis or Technology Development Phases preceding Milestone B of the Defense Acquisition System and has been identified to have the potential to become a major defense acquisition program.
              “Systems engineering and technical assistance.”
              (1) “Systems engineering” means an interdisciplinary technical effort to evolve and verify an integrated and total life cycle balanced set of system, people, and process solutions that satisfy customer needs.
              (2) “Technical assistance” means the acquisition support, program management support, analyses, and other activities involved in the management and execution of an acquisition program.
              (3) “Systems engineering and technical assistance”—
              (i) Means a combination of activities related to the development of technical information to support various acquisition processes. Examples of systems engineering and technical assistance activities include, but are not limited to, supporting acquisition efforts such as—
              (A) Deriving requirements;
              (B) Performing technology assessments;
              (C) Developing acquisition strategies;
              (D) Conducting risk assessments;
              (E) Developing cost estimates;
              (F) Determining specifications;
              (G) Evaluating contractor performance and conducting independent verification and validation;
              (H) Directing other contractors' (other than subcontractors) operations;
              (I) Developing test requirements and evaluating test data;
              (J) Developing work statements (but see paragraph (ii)(B) of this definition).
              (ii) Does not include—
              (A) Design and development work of design and development contractors, in accordance with FAR 9.505-2(a)(3) or FAR 9.505-2(b)(3), and the guidance at PGI 209.571-7; or
              (B) Preparation of work statements by contractors, acting as industry representatives, under the supervision and control of Government representatives, in accordance with FAR 9.505-2(b)(1)(ii).

              (a) This subsection applies to major defense acquisition programs.
              
              (b) To the extent that this section is inconsistent with FAR subpart 9.5, this section takes precedence.

              209.571-3
              Policy.
              It is DoD policy that—
              (a) Agencies shall obtain advice on major defense acquisition programs and pre-major defense acquisition programs from sources that are objective and unbiased; and
              (b) Contracting officers generally should seek to resolve organizational conflicts of interest in a manner that will promote competition and preserve DoD access to the expertise and experience of qualified contractors. Accordingly, contracting officers should, to the extent feasible, employ organizational conflict of interest resolution strategies that do not unnecessarily restrict the pool of potential offerors in current or future acquisitions. Further, contracting activities shall not impose across-the-board restrictions or limitations on the use of particular resolution methods, except as may be required under 209.571-7 or as may be appropriate in particular acquisitions.

              Mitigation.
              (a) Mitigation is any action taken to minimize an organizational conflict of interest. Mitigation may require Government action, contractor action, or a combination of both.
              (b) If the contracting officer and the contractor have agreed to mitigation of an organizational conflict of interest, a Government-approved Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan, reflecting the actions a contractor has agreed to take to mitigate a conflict, shall be incorporated into the contract.

              (c) If the contracting officer determines, after consultation with agency legal counsel, that the otherwise successful offeror is unable to effectively mitigate an organizational conflict of interest, then the contracting officer, taking into account both the instant contract and longer term Government needs, shall use another approach to resolve the organizational conflict of interest, select another offeror, or request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 (but see statutory prohibition in 209.571-7, which cannot be waived).
              (d) For any acquisition that exceeds $1 billion, the contracting officer shall brief the senior procurement executive before determining that an offeror's mitigation plan is unacceptable.

              Identification of organizational conflicts of interest.
              When evaluating organizational conflicts of interest for major defense acquisition programs or pre-major defense acquisition programs, contracting officers shall consider—
              (a) The ownership of business units performing systems engineering and technical assistance, professional services, or management support services to a major defense acquisition program or a pre-major defense acquisition program by a contractor who simultaneously owns a business unit competing (or potentially competing) to perform as—
              (1) The prime contractor for the same major defense acquisition program; or
              (2) The supplier of a major subsystem or component for the same major defense acquisition program.
              (b) The proposed award of a major subsystem by a prime contractor to business units or other affiliates of the same parent corporate entity, particularly the award of a subcontract for software integration or the development of a proprietary software system architecture; and
              (c) The performance by, or assistance of, contractors in technical evaluation.

              Systems engineering and technical assistance contracts.

              (a) Agencies shall obtain advice on systems architecture and systems engineering matters with respect to major defense acquisition programs or pre-major defense acquisition programs from Federally Funded Research and Development Centers or other sources independent of the major defense acquisition program contractor.
              (b) Limitation on Future Contracting. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this subsection, a contract for the performance of systems engineering and technical assistance for a major defense acquisition program or a pre-major defense acquisition program shall prohibit the contractor or any affiliate of the contractor from participating as a contractor or major subcontractor in the development or production of a weapon system under such program.
              (2) The requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection cannot be waived.
              (c) Exception. (1) The requirement in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection does not apply if the head of the contracting activity determines that—
              (i) An exception is necessary because DoD needs the domain experience and expertise of the highly qualified, apparently successful offeror; and
              (ii) Based on the agreed-to resolution strategy, the apparently successful offeror will be able to provide objective and unbiased advice, as required by 209.571-3(a), without a limitation on future participation in development and production.
              (2) The authority to make this determination cannot be delegated.

            (i) Conduct market research appropriate to the circumstances before issuing a solicitation with tiered evaluation of offers (section 816 of Pub. L. 109-163); and
            (ii) Use the results of market research to determine whether the criteria in FAR part 19 are met for setting aside the acquisition for small business or, for a task or delivery order, whether there are a sufficient number of qualified small business concerns available to justify limiting competition under the terms of the contract. If the contracting officer cannot determine whether the criteria are met, the contracting officer shall include a written explanation in the contract file as to why such a determination could not be made (section 816 of Pub. L. 109-163).
            (c)(2) In addition to the notification requirements at FAR 10.001(c)(2)(i) and (ii), see 205.205-70 for the bundling notification publication requirement.

              General.
              Item unique identification and valuation is a system of marking, valuing, and tracking items delivered to DoD that enhances logistics, contracting, and financial business transactions supporting the United States and coalition troops. Through item unique identification policy, which capitalizes on leading practices and embraces open standards, DoD—
              (a) Achieves lower life-cycle cost of item management and improves life-cycle property management;
              (b) Improves operational readiness;
              (c) Provides reliable accountability of property and asset visibility throughout the life cycle;
              (d) Reduces the burden on the workforce through increased productivity and efficiency; and
              (e) Ensures item level traceability throughout lifecycle to strengthen supply chain integrity, enhance cyber security, and combat counterfeiting.

              211.274-2
              Policy for item unique identification.
              (a) It is DoD policy that DoD item unique identification, or a DoD recognized unique identification equivalent, is required for all delivered items, including items of contractor-acquired property delivered on contract line items (see PGI 245.402-71 for guidance when delivery of contractor acquired property is required)—
              (1) For which the Government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more;
              (2) For which the Government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when the requiring activity determines that item unique identification is required for mission essential or controlled inventory items; or
              (3) Regardless of value for any—
              (i) DoD serially managed item (reparable or nonreparable) or subassembly, component, or part embedded within a subassembly, component, or part;
              (ii) Parent item (as defined in 252.211-7003(a)) that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part;
              (iii) Warranted serialized item;
              (iv) Item of special tooling or special test equipment, as defined at FAR 2.101, for a major defense acquisition program that is designated for preservation and storage in accordance with the requirements of section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417); and
              (v) High risk item identified by the requiring activity as vulnerable to supply chain threat, a target of cyber threats, or counterfeiting.
              (b) Exceptions. The contractor will not be required to provide DoD item unique identification if—
              (1) The items, as determined by the head of the contracting activity, are to be used to support a contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping operation; to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack; to facilitate the provision of international disaster assistance; or to support response to an emergency or major disaster; or
              (2) A determination and findings has been executed concluding that it is more cost effective for the Government requiring activity to assign, mark, and register the unique item identifier after delivery, and the item is either acquired from a small business concern, or is a commercial item acquired under FAR part 12 or part 8.

              (i) The determination and findings shall be executed by—
              
              (A) The Component Acquisition Executive for an acquisition category (ACAT) I program; or
              (B) The head of the contracting activity for all other programs.

              (a) It is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the Government's unit acquisition cost for all deliverable end items to which item unique identification applies.
              (b) The Government's unit acquisition cost is—
              (1) For fixed-price type line, subline, or exhibit line items, the unit price identified in the contract at the time of delivery;
              (2) For cost-type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items, the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery; and
              (3) For items delivered under a time-and-materials contract, the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery.
              (c) The Government's unit acquisition cost of subassemblies, components, and parts embedded in delivered items shall not be separately identified.

              (b) The following items are not required to be reported:
              (1) Contractor-acquired property, as defined in FAR part 45.
              (2) Property under any statutory leasing authority.
              (3) Property to which the Government has acquired a lien or title solely because of partial, advance, progress, or performance-based payments.
              (4) Intellectual property or software.
              (5) Real property.

              Applicability.
              (a)(i) Commercial item determination. When using FAR part 12 procedures for acquisitions exceeding $1 million in value, except for acquisitions made pursuant to FAR 12.102(f)(1), the contracting officer shall—
              (A) Determine in writing that the acquisition meets the commercial item definition in FAR 2.101;
              (B) Include the written determination in the contract file; and
              (C) Obtain approval at one level above the contracting officer when a commercial item determination relies on subsections (1)(ii), (3), (4), or (6) of the “commercial item” definition at FAR 2.101.
              (D) Follow the procedures and guidance at PGI 212.102(a)(i) regarding file documentation and commercial item determinations.
              (ii) Prior commercial item determination. This section implements 10 U.S.C. 2306a(b)(4) and 10 U.S.C. 2380(b).
              (A) The contracting officer may presume that a prior commercial item determination made by a military department, a defense agency, or another component of DoD shall serve as a determination for subsequent procurements of such item. See PGI 212.102(a)(ii) for information about items that the Department has historically acquired as military unique, noncommercial items.
              (B) If the contracting officer does not make the presumption that a prior commercial item determination is valid, and instead chooses to proceed with a procurement of an item previously determined to be a commercial item using procedures other than the procedures authorized for the procurement of a commercial item, the contracting officer shall request a review of the commercial item determination by the head of the contracting activity that will conduct the procurement. Not later than 30 days after receiving a request for review of a commercial item determination, the head of a contracting activity shall—
              (1) Confirm that the prior determination was appropriate and still applicable; or
              (2) Issue a determination that the prior use of FAR part 12 procedures was improper or that it is no longer appropriate to acquire the item using FAR part 12 procedures, with a written explanation of the basis for the determination (see 212.70).
              (iii) Nontraditional defense contractors. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2380a, contracting officers may treat supplies and services provided by nontraditional defense contractors as commercial items. This permissive authority is intended to enhance defense innovation and investment, enable DoD to acquire items that otherwise might not have been available, and create incentives for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DoD. It is not intended to recategorize current noncommercial items, however, when appropriate, contracting officers may consider applying commercial item procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from business segments that meet the definition of “nontraditional defense contractor” even though they have been established under traditional defense contractors. The decision to apply commercial item procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from nontraditional defense contractors does not require a commercial item determination and does not mean the item is commercial.

              (a) Market research shall be used, where appropriate, to inform price reasonableness determinations.
              (b) If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, is insufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison. In assessing whether the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison, the contracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased (10 U.S.C. 2306a(b)).

              (c) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information as described in paragraph (b) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to submit information on—
              (1) Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;
              (2) Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;
              (3) Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and

              (ii) DoD will realize a cost savings compared to the cost of procuring a similar quantity or level of such item or service using commercial acquisition procedures.

              (2) In the case of a procurement valued at $100 million or more, a contract may not be awarded pursuant to a conversion of the procurement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section until a copy of the head of contracting activity determination is provided to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.
              (b) In making a determination under paragraph (a) of this section, the determining official shall, at a minimum, consider the following factors:
              (1) The estimated cost of research and development to be performed by the existing contractor to improve future products or services.
              (2) The costs for DoD and the contractor in assessing and responding to data requests to support a conversion to noncommercial acquisition procedures.
              (3) Changes in purchase quantities.
              (4) Costs associated with potential procurement delays resulting from the conversion.

              (ii) The contracting office is seeking a source that accepts the purchase card.
              (2) To prevent mission delays, if an activity does not have a resident general or flag officer of SES member, delegation of this authority to the level of the senior local commander or director is permitted; or
              (c) The purchase or payment meets one or more of the following criteria:
              (1) The place of performance is entirely outside the United States and its outlying areas.
              (2) The purchase is a Standard Form 44 purchase for aviation fuel or oil.

              (7) The payment is for a transportation bill.
              (8) The purchase is under a Federal Supply Schedule contract that does not permit use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card.
              (9) The purchase is for medical services and—
              (i) It involves a controlled substance or narcotic;
              (ii) It requires the submission of a Health Care Summary Record to document the nature of the care purchased;
              (iii) The ultimate price of the medical care is subject to an independent determination that changes the price paid based on application of a mandatory CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge determination that reduces the Government liability below billed charges;
              (iv) The Government already has entered into a contract to pay for the services without the use of a purchase card;
              (v) The purchaser is a beneficiary seeking medical care; or
              (vi) The senior local commander or director of a hospital or laboratory determines that use of the purchase card is not appropriate or cost-effective. The Medical Prime Vendor Program and the DoD Medical Electronic Catalog Program are two examples where use of the purchase card may not be cost-effective.

            (a) In accordance with section 368 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Pub. L. 112-81), when acquiring tents or other temporary structures for use by the Armed Forces, the contracting officer shall award contracts that provide the best value. Temporary structures covered by this paragraph are nonpermanent buildings, including tactical shelters, nonpermanent modular or pre-fabricated buildings, or portable or relocatable buildings, such as trailers or equipment configured for occupancy (see also 246.270-2). Determination of best value includes consideration of the total life-cycle costs of such tents or structures, including the costs associated with any equipment, fuel, or electricity needed to heat, cool, or light such tents or structures (see FAR 7.105(a)(3)(i) and PGI 207.105(a)(3)(i)).
            (b) The requirements of this section apply to any agency or department that acquires tents or other temporary structures on behalf of DoD (see FAR 17.503(d)(2)).

            Limitations and prohibitions.
            The following limitations and prohibitions apply when considering the use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection procedures.
            (a) Limitations.
            
            (1) In accordance with section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub. L. 114-328) as amended by section 822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L. 115-91) (see 10 U.S.C. 2305 note), the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process shall only be used when—
            (i) Minimum requirements can be described clearly and comprehensively and expressed in terms of performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to determine the acceptability of offers;
            (ii) No, or minimal, value will be realized from a proposal that exceeds the minimum technical or performance requirements;
            (iii) The proposed technical approaches will require no, or minimal, subjective judgment by the source selection authority as to the desirability of one offeror's proposal versus a competing proposal;
            (iv) The source selection authority has a high degree of confidence that reviewing the technical proposals of all offerors would not result in the identification of characteristics that could provide value or benefit;
            (v) No, or minimal, additional innovation or future technological advantage will be realized by using a different source selection process;

            (vi) Goods to be procured are predominantly expendable in nature, are nontechnical, or have a short life expectancy or short shelf life (See PGI 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vi) for assistance with evaluating whether a requirement satisfies this limitation);
            
            (vii) The contract file contains a determination that the lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs (as defined at FAR 7.101) of the product(s) or service(s) being acquired (see PGI 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vii) for information on obtaining this determination); and
            (viii) The contracting officer documents the contract file describing the circumstances justifying the use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.
            (2) In accordance with section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, as amended by section 822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L. 115-91) (see 10 U.S.C. 2305 note), contracting officers shall avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process in the case of a procurement that is predominately for the acquisition of—
            (i) Information technology services, cybersecurity services, systems engineering and technical assistance services, advanced electronic testing, or other knowledge-based professional services;
            (ii) Items designated by the requiring activity as personal protective equipment (except see paragraph (b)(1) of this section); or
            (iii) Services designated by the requiring activity as knowledge-based training or logistics services in contingency operations or other operations outside the United States, including in Afghanistan or Iraq.
            (b) Prohibitions.
            
            (1) In accordance with section 814 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 as amended by section 882 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (see 10 U.S.C. 2302 note), contracting officers shall not use the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to procure items designated by the requiring activity as personal protective equipment or an aviation critical safety item, when the requiring activity advises the contracting officer that the level of quality or failure of the equipment or item could result in combat casualties. See 252.209-7010 for the definition and identification of critical safety items.
            (2) In accordance with section 832 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (see 10 U.S.C. 2442 note), contracting officers shall not use the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to acquire engineering and manufacturing development for a major defense acquisition program for which budgetary authority is requested beginning in fiscal year 2019.
            (3) Contracting officers shall make award decisions based on best value factors and criteria, as determined by the resource sponsor (in accordance with agency procedures), for an auditing contract. The use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is prohibited (10 U.S.C. 254b).

              (a) The tiered or cascading order of precedence used for tiered evaluation of offers shall be consistent with FAR part 19.

              (b) Consideration shall be given to the tiers of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, small business) before evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
              (c) The contracting officer is prohibited from issuing a solicitation with a tiered evaluation of offers unless—
              (1) The contracting officer conducts market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10 and Part 210, to determine—
              (i) Whether the criteria in FAR part 19 are met for setting aside the acquisition for small business; or
              (ii) For a task or delivery order, whether there are a sufficient number of qualified small business concerns available to justify limiting competition under the terms of the contract; and

              (2) If the contracting officer cannot determine whether the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are met, the contracting officer includes a written explanation in the contract file as to why such a determination could not be made (Section 816 of Public Law 109-163).

              (c)(i) In acquisitions that require use of the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, other than those based on the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process (see FAR 15.101-2), the extent of participation of small businesses (to include service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns) in performance of the contract shall be addressed in source selection. The contracting officer shall evaluate the extent to which offerors identify and commit to small business performance of the contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.
              (A) See PGI 215.304(c)(i)(A) for examples of evaluation factors.
              (B) Proposals addressing the extent of small business performance shall be separate from subcontracting plans submitted pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.219-9 and shall be structured to allow for consideration of offers from small businesses.
              (C) When an evaluation assesses the extent that small businesses are specifically identified in proposals, the small businesses considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9 to facilitate compliance with 252.219-7003(e).
              (ii) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2436, consider the purchase of capital assets (including machine tools) manufactured in the United States, in source selections for all major defense acquisition programs as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2430.
              (iii) See 247.573-2(c) for additional evaluation factors required in solicitations for the direct purchase of ocean transportation services.
              (iv) In accordance with section 812 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, consider the manufacturing readiness and manufacturing-readiness processes of potential contractors and subcontractors as a part of the source selection process for major defense acquisition programs.

              (v) Include an evaluation factor regarding supply chain risk (see subpart 239.73) when acquiring information technology, whether as a service or as a supply, that is a covered system, is a part of a covered system, or is in support of a covered system, as defined in 239.7301.

              (1) Consult with the requiring activity as to whether the requirements document should be revised in order to promote more competition (see FAR 6.502(b) and 11.002); and
              (2) Resolicit, allowing an additional period of at least 30 days for receipt of proposals; and
              (b) For competitive solicitations in which more than one potential offeror expressed an interest in an acquisition, but only one offer was ultimately received, follow the procedures at PGI 215.371-2.

              For acquisitions that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, if only one offer is received when competitive procedures were used and it is not necessary to resolicit in accordance with 215.371-2(a), then then the contracting officer shall comply with the following:
              (a) If no additional cost or pricing data are required to determine through cost or price analysis that the offered price is fair and reasonable, the contracting officer shall require that any cost or pricing data provided in the proposal be certified if the acquisition exceeds the certified cost or pricing data threshold and an exception to the requirement for certified cost or pricing data at FAR 15.403-1(b)(2) through (5) does not apply.
              (b) Otherwise, the contracting officer shall obtain additional cost or pricing data to determine a fair and reasonable price. If the acquisition exceeds the certified cost or pricing data threshold and an exception to the requirement for certified cost or pricing data at FAR 15.403-1(b)(2) through (5) does not apply, the cost or pricing data shall be certified.
              (c) If the contracting officer is still unable to determine that the offered price is fair and reasonable, the contracting officer shall enter into negotiations with the offeror to establish a fair and reasonable price. The negotiated price should not exceed the offered price.
              (d) If the contracting officer is unable to negotiate a fair and reasonable price, see FAR 15.405(d).

              (1) Acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;
              (2) Acquisitions, as determined by the head of the contracting activity, in support of contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping operations; to facilitate defense against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack; to facilitate the provision of international disaster assistance; or to support response to an emergency or major disaster;
              (3) Small business set-asides under FAR subpart 19.5, set asides offered and accepted into the 8(a) Program under FAR subpart 19.8, or set-asides under the HUBZone Program (see FAR 19.1305(c)), the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Procurement Program (see FAR 19.1405(c)), or the Women-Owned Small Business Program (see FAR 19.1505(d));

              (5) Acquisitions of architect-engineer services (see FAR 36.601-2).
              (b) The applicability of an exception in paragraph (a) of this section does not eliminate the need for the contracting officer to seek maximum practicable competition and to ensure that the price is fair and reasonable.

              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              
                Market prices means current prices that are established in the course of ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be substantiated through competition or from sources independent of the offerors.
              
                Relevant sales data means information provided by an offeror of sales of the same or similar items that can be used to establish price reasonableness taking into consideration the age, volume, and nature of the transactions (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments).

              Pricing policy.
              (a)(i) Pursuant to section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)—
              (A) The contracting officer is responsible for determining if the information provided by the offeror is sufficient to determine price reasonableness. This responsibility includes determining whether information on the prices at which the same or similar items have previously been sold is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of price, and determining the extent of uncertified cost data that should be required in cases in which price information is not adequate;
              (B) The contracting officer shall not limit the Government's ability to obtain any data that may be necessary to support a determination of fair and reasonable pricing by agreeing to contract terms that preclude obtaining necessary supporting information; and
              (C) When obtaining uncertified cost data, the contracting officer shall require the offeror to provide the information in the form in which it is regularly maintained in the offeror's business operations.
              (ii) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.402 when conducting cost or price analysis, particularly with regard to acquisitions for sole source commercial items.

              Obtaining certified cost or pricing data.
            
            
              215.403-1
              Prohibition on obtaining certified cost or pricing data (10 U.S.C. 2306a and 41 U.S.C. chapter 35).
              (b) Exceptions to certified cost or pricing data requirements. (i) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.403-1(b).
              (ii) Submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required in the case of a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract to the extent such data relates to an indirect offset.
              (c) Standards for exceptions from certified cost or pricing data requirements—(1) Adequate price competition.
              
              (A) For acquisitions under dual or multiple source programs—
              (1) The determination of adequate price competition must be made on a case-by-case basis. Even when adequate price competition exists, in certain cases it may be appropriate to obtain additional data to assist in price analysis; and
              (2) Adequate price competition normally exists when—
              (i) Prices are solicited across a full range of step quantities, normally including a 0-100 percent split, from at least two offerors that are individually capable of producing the full quantity; and
              (ii) The reasonableness of all prices awarded is clearly established on the basis of price analysis (see FAR 15.404-1(b)).
              
              (B) If only one offer is received in response to a competitive solicitation, see 215.371-3.
              (3) Commercial items. (A) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.403-1(c)(3)(A) for pricing commercial items.
              (B) By November 30th of each year, departments and agencies shall provide a report to the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP), ATTN: DPAP/CPIC, of all contracting officer determinations that commercial item exceptions apply under FAR 15.403-1(b)(3), during the previous fiscal year, for any contract, subcontract, or modification expected to have a value of $19.5 million or more. See PGI 215.403-1(c)(3)(B) for the format and guidance for the report. The Director, DPAP, will submit a consolidated report to the congressional defense committees.
              (C) When applying the commercial item exception under FAR 15.403-1(b)(3), see 212.102(a)(ii) regarding prior commercial item determinations.
              (4) Waivers. (A) The head of the contracting activity may, without power of delegation, apply the exceptional circumstances authority when a determination is made that—
              (1) The property or services cannot reasonably be obtained under the contract, subcontract, or modification, without the granting of the waiver;
              (2) The price can be determined to be fair and reasonable without the submission of certified cost or pricing data; and
              (3) There are demonstrated benefits to granting the waiver. Follow the procedures at PGI 215.403-1(c)(4)(A) for determining when an exceptional case waiver is appropriate, for approval of such waivers, for partial waivers, and for waivers applicable to unpriced supplies or services.
              (B) By November 30th of each year, departments and agencies shall provide a report to the Director, DPAP, ATTN: DPAP/CPIC, of all waivers granted under FAR 15.403-1(b)(4), during the previous fiscal year, for any contract, subcontract, or modification expected to have a value of $19.5 million or more. See PGI 215.403-1(c)(4)(B) for the format and guidance for the report. The Director, DPAP, will submit a consolidated report to the congressional defense committees.
              (C) DoD has waived the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data for the Canadian Commercial Corporation and its subcontractors (but see 215.408(3) and 225.870-4(c)).
              (D) DoD has waived certified cost or pricing data requirements for nonprofit organizations (including education institutions) on cost-reimbursement-no-fee contracts. The contracting officer shall require—
              (1) Submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine reasonableness and cost realism; and
              (2) Certified cost or pricing data from subcontractors that are not nonprofit organizations when the subcontractor's proposal exceeds the certified cost or pricing data threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1).

              Proposal analysis techniques.
              (a) General. (i) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.404-1 for proposal analysis.
              (ii) For spare parts or support equipment, perform an analysis of—
              (A) Those line items where the proposed price exceeds by 25 percent or more the lowest price the Government has paid within the most recent 12-month period based on reasonably available data;
              (B) Those line items where a comparison of the item description and the proposal price indicates a potential for overpricing;
              (C) Significant high-dollar-value items. If there are no obvious high-dollar-value items, include an analysis of a random sample of items; and
              (D) A random sample of the remaining low-dollar value items. Sample size may be determined by subjective judgment, e.g., experience with the offeror and the reliability of its estimating and accounting systems.
              (b) Price analysis for commercial and noncommercial items. (i) In the absence of adequate price competition in response to the solicitation, pricing based on market prices is the preferred method to establish a fair and reasonable price (see PGI 215.404-1(b)(i)).
              (ii) If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research is insufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison. The contracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased (section 853 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Pub. L. 114-92)).
              (iii) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information as described in paragraph (b)(ii) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to submit information on—
              (A) Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;
              (B) Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;
              (C) Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and
              (D) Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining the reasonableness of price.
              (iv) If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information, to include cost data. However, no cost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price (section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)).
              (v) When evaluating pricing data, the contracting officer shall consider materially differing terms and conditions, quantities, and market and economic factors. For similar items, the contracting officer shall also consider material differences between the similar item and the item being procured (see FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)(B) and PGI 215.404-1(b)(v)). Material differences are those that could reasonably be expected to influence the contracting officer's determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer shall consider the following factors when evaluating the relevance of the information available:
              (A) Market prices.
              
              (B) Age of data.
              
              (1) Whether data is too old to be relevant depends on the industry (e.g., rapidly evolving technologies), product maturity (e.g., stable), economic factors (e.g., new sellers in the marketplace), and various other considerations.
              (2) A pending sale may be relevant if, in the judgement of the contracting officer, it is probable at the anticipated price, and the sale could reasonably be expected to materially influence the contracting officer's determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer may consult with the cognizant administrative contracting officers (ACOs) as they may have information about pending sales.
              (C) Volume and completeness of transaction data. Data must include a sufficient number of transactions to represent the range of relevant sales to all types of customers. The data must also include key information, such as date, quantity sold, part number, part nomenclature, sales price, and customer. If the number of transactions is insufficient or the data is incomplete, the contracting officer shall request additional sales data to evaluate price reasonableness. If the contractor cannot provide sufficient sales data, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information.
              (D) Nature of transactions. The nature of a sales transaction includes the information necessary to understand the transaction, such as terms and conditions, date, quantity sold, sale price, unique requirements, the type of customer (government, distributor, retail end-user, etc.), and related agreements. It also includes warranties, key product technical specifications, maintenance agreements, and preferred customer rewards.
              (vi) The contracting officer shall consider catalog prices to be reliable when they are regularly maintained and supported by relevant sales data (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments). The contracting officer may request that the offeror support differences between the proposed price(s), catalog price(s), and relevant sales data.
              (vii) The contracting officer may consult with the DoD cadre of experts who are available to provide expert advice to the acquisition workforce in assisting with commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. The DoD cadre of experts is identified at PGI 215.404-1(b)(vii).

              Profit.
              (b) Policy. (1) Contracting officers shall use a structured approach for developing a prenegotiation profit or fee objective on any negotiated contract action when certified cost or pricing data is obtained, except for cost-plus-award-fee contracts (see 215.404-74, 216.405-2, and FAR 16.405-2) or contracts with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) (see 215.404-75). There are three structured approaches—
              (A) The weighted guidelines method;
              (B) The modified weighted guidelines method; and
              (C) An alternate structured approach.
              (c) Contracting officer responsibilities. (1) Also, do not perform a profit analysis when assessing cost realism in competitive acquisitions.
              (2) When using a structured approach, the contracting officer—
              (A) Shall use the weighted guidelines method (see 215.404-71), except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2)(B) and (c)(2)(C) of this subsection.
              (B) Shall use the modified weighted guidelines method (see 215.404-72) on contract actions with nonprofit organizations other than FFRDCs.
              (C) May use an alternate structured approach (see 215.404-73) when—
              (1) The contract action is—
              (i) At or below the certified cost or pricing data threshold (see FAR 15.403-4(a)(1));
              (ii) For architect-engineer or construction work;
              (iii) Primarily for delivery of material from subcontractors; or
              (iv) A termination settlement; or
              (2) The weighted guidelines method does not produce a reasonable overall profit objective and the head of the contracting activity approves use of the alternate approach in writing.
              (D) Shall use the weighted guidelines method to establish a basic profit rate under a formula-type pricing agreement, and may then use the basic rate on all actions under the agreement, provided that conditions affecting profit do not change.
              (E) Shall document the profit analysis in the contract file.
              (5) Although specific agreement on the applied weights or values for individual profit factors shall not be attempted, the contracting officer may encourage the contractor to—
              (A) Present the details of its proposed profit amounts in the weighted guidelines format or similar structured approached; and
              (B) Use the weighted guidelines method in developing profit objectives for negotiated subcontracts.
              (6) The contracting officer must also verify that relevant variables have not materially changed (e.g., performance risk, interest rates, progress payment rates, distribution of facilities capital).
              (d) Profit-analysis factors—(1) Common factors. The common factors are embodied in the DoD structured approaches and need not be further considered by the contracting officer.

              215.404-71-1
              General.
              (a) The weighted guidelines method focuses on four profit factors—
              (1) Performance risk;
              (2) Contract type risk;
              (3) Facilities capital employed; and
              (4) Cost efficiency.
              (b) The contracting officer assigns values to each profit factor; the value multiplied by the base results in the profit objective for that factor. Except for the cost efficiency special factor, each profit factor has a normal value and a designated range of values. The normal value is representative of average conditions on the prospective contract when compared to all goods and services acquired by DoD. The designated range provides values based on above normal or below normal conditions. In the price negotiation documentation, the contracting officer need not explain assignment of the normal value, but should address conditions that justify assignment of other than the normal value. The cost efficiency special factor has no normal value. The contracting officer shall exercise sound business judgment in selecting a value when this special factor is used (see 215.404-71-5).

              Performance risk.
              (a) Description. This profit factor addresses the contractor's degree of risk in fulfilling the contract requirements. The factor consists of two parts:
              (1) Technical—the technical uncertainties of performance.
              (2) Management/cost control—the degree of management effort necessary—
              (i) To ensure that contract requirements are met; and
              (ii) To reduce and control costs.
              (b) Determination. The following extract from the DD Form 1547 is annotated to describe the process.

For the technical factor only, contracting officers may use the technology incentive range for acquisitions that include development, production, or application of innovative new technologies. The technology incentive range does not apply to efforts restricted to studies, analyses, or demonstrations that have a technical report as their primary deliverable.
              (d) Evaluation criteria for technical. (1) Review the contract requirements and focus on the critical performance elements in the statement of work or specifications. Factors to consider include—
              (i) Technology being applied or developed by the contractor;
              (ii) Technical complexity;
              (iii) Program maturity;
              (iv) Performance specifications and tolerances;
              (v) Delivery schedule; and
              (vi) Extent of a warranty or guarantee.
              (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value in those cases where there is a substantial technical risk. Indicators are—
              (A) Items are being manufactured using specifications with stringent tolerance limits;
              (B) The efforts require highly skilled personnel or require the use of state-of-the-art machinery;
              (C) The services and analytical efforts are extremely important to the Government and must be performed to exacting standards;
              (D) The contractor's independent development and investment has reduced the Government's risk or cost;
              (E) The contractor has accepted an accelerated delivery schedule to meet DoD requirements; or
              (F) The contractor has assumed additional risk through warranty provisions.
              (ii) Extremely complex, vital efforts to overcome difficult technical obstacles that require personnel with exceptional abilities, experience, and professional credentials may justify a value significantly above normal.
              (iii) The following may justify a maximum value—
              (A) Development or initial production of a new item, particularly if performance or quality specifications are tight; or
              (B) A high degree of development or production concurrency.
              (3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value in those cases where the technical risk is low. Indicators are—
              (A) Requirements are relatively simple;
              (B) Technology is not complex;

              (C) Efforts do not require highly skilled personnel;
              
              (D) Efforts are routine;
              (E) Programs are mature; or
              (F) Acquisition is a follow-on effort or a repetitive type acquisition.
              (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below normal for—
              (A) Routine services;
              (B) Production of simple items;
              (C) Rote entry or routine integration of Government-furnished information; or
              (D) Simple operations with Government-furnished property.
              (4) Technology incentive range. (i) The contracting officer may assign values within the technology incentive range when contract performance includes the introduction of new, significant technological innovation. Use the technology incentive range only for the most innovative contract efforts. Innovation may be in the form of—
              (A) Development or application of new technology that fundamentally changes the characteristics of an existing product or system and that results in increased technical performance, improved reliability, or reduced costs; or
              (B) New products or systems that contain significant technological advances over the products or systems they are replacing.
              (ii) When selecting a value within the technology incentive range, the contracting officer should consider the relative value of the proposed innovation to the acquisition as a whole. When the innovation represents a minor benefit, the contracting officer should consider using values less than the norm. For innovative efforts that will have a major positive impact on the product or program, the contracting officer may use values above the norm.
              (e) Evaluation criteria for management/cost control. (1) The contracting officer should evaluate—
              (i) The contractor's management and internal control systems using contracting office data, information and reviews made by field contract administration offices or other DoD field offices;
              (ii) The management involvement expected on the prospective contract action;
              (iii) The degree of cost mix as an indication of the types of resources applied and value added by the contractor;
              (iv) The contractor's support of Federal socioeconomic programs;
              (v) The expected reliability of the contractor's cost estimates (including the contractor's cost estimating system);
              (vi) The adequacy of the contractor's management approach to controlling cost and schedule; and
              (vii) Any other factors that affect the contractor's ability to meet the cost targets (e.g., foreign currency exchange rates and inflation rates).
              (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when there is a high degree of management effort. Indicators of this are—
              (A) The contractor's value added is both considerable and reasonably difficult;
              (B) The effort involves a high degree of integration or coordination;
              (C) The contractor has a good record of past performance;
              (D) The contractor has a substantial record of active participation in Federal socioeconomic programs;
              (E) The contractor provides fully documented and reliable cost estimates;
              (F) The contractor makes appropriate make-or-buy decisions; or
              (G) The contractor has a proven record of cost tracking and control.
              (ii) The contracting officer may justify a maximum value when the effort—
              (A) Requires large scale integration of the most complex nature;
              (B) Involves major international activities with significant management coordination (e.g., offsets with foreign vendors); or
              (C) Has critically important milestones.

              (iii) If the contractor demonstrates efficient management and cost control through the submittal of a timely, qualifying proposal (as defined in217.7401) in furtherance of definitization of an undefinitized contract action, and the proposal demonstrates effective cost control from the time of award to the present, the contracting officer may add 1 percentage point to the value determined for management/cost control up to the maximum of 7 percent.
              (3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when the management effort is minimal. Indicators of this are—
              (A) The program is mature and many end item deliveries have been made;
              (B) The contractor adds minimal value to an item;
              (C) The efforts are routine and require minimal supervision;
              (D) The contractor provides poor quality, untimely proposals;
              (E) The contractor fails to provide an adequate analysis of subcontractor costs;
              (F) The contractor does not cooperate in the evaluation and negotiation of the proposal;
              (G) The contractor's cost estimating system is marginal;
              (H) The contractor has made minimal effort to initiate cost reduction programs;
              (I) The contractor's cost proposal is inadequate;
              (J) The contractor has a record of cost overruns or another indication of unreliable cost estimates and lack of cost control; or
              (K) The contractor has a poor record of past performance.
              (ii) The following may justify a value significantly below normal—
              (A) Reviews performed by the field contract administration offices disclose unsatisfactory management and internal control systems (e.g., quality assurance, property control, safety, security); or
              (B) The effort requires an unusually low degree of management involvement.

              Contract type risk and working capital adjustment.
              (a) Description. The contract type risk factor focuses on the degree of cost risk accepted by the contractor under varying contract types. The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit objective for contract type risk. It only applies to fixed-price contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula approach, it is not intended to be an exact calculation of the cost of working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the contractor's cost of working capital under varying contract circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.
              (b) Determination. The following extract from the DD 1547 is annotated to explain the process.

              (1) Select a value from the list of contract types in paragraph (c) of this section using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
              (2)(i) Insert the amount of costs incurred as of the date the contractor submits a qualifying proposal, such as under an undefinitized contract action, (excluding facilities capital cost of money) into the Block 24a column titled Base.

              (ii) Insert the amount of Government estimated cost to complete (excluding facilities capital cost of money) into the Block 24b column titled Base.
              (3) Multiply (1) by (2)(i) and (2)(ii), respectively for Blocks 24a and 24b. Add Blocks 24a and 24b and insert the totals in Block 24c.
              (4) Only complete this block when the prospective contract is a fixed-price contract containing provisions for progress payments.
              (5) Insert the amount computed per paragraph (e) of this subsection.
              (6) Insert the appropriate figure from paragraph (f) of this subsection.

              (7) Use the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury (see https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsservices/gov/pmt/promptPayment/rates.htm). Do not use any other interest rate.
              (8) Multiply (5) by (6) by (7). This is the working capital adjustment. It shall not exceed 4 percent of the contract costs in Block 20.
              (c) Values: Normal and designated ranges.

              (1) “No financing” means either that the contract does not provide progress payments or performance-based payments, or that the contract provides them only on a limited basis, such as financing of first articles. Do not compute a working capital adjustment.
              (2) When the contract contains provisions for progress payments, compute a working capital adjustment (Block 25).
              (3) For the purposes of assigning profit values, treat a fixed-price contract with redetermination provisions as if it were a fixed-price incentive contract with below normal conditions.
              (4) Cost-plus contracts shall not receive the working capital adjustment.
              (5) These types of contracts are considered cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts for the purposes of assigning profit values. They shall not receive the working capital adjustment in Block 25. However, they may receive higher than normal values within the designated range to the extent that portions of cost are fixed.
              (6) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based payments, do not compute a working capital adjustment.
              (d) Evaluation criteria—(1) General. The contracting officer should consider elements that affect contract type risk such as—
              (i) Length of contract;
              (ii) Adequacy of cost data for projections;
              (iii) Economic environment;
              (iv) Nature and extent of subcontracted activity;
              (v) Protection provided to the contractor under contract provisions (e.g., economic price adjustment clauses);
              (vi) The ceilings and share lines contained in incentive provisions;
              (vii) Risks associated with contracts for foreign military sales (FMS) that are not funded by U.S. appropriations; and
              (viii) When the contract contains provisions for performance-based payments—
              (A) The frequency of payments;
              (B) The total amount of payments compared to the maximum allowable amount specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); and

              (C) The risk of the payment schedule to the contractor.
              
              (2) Mandatory.(i) The contracting officer shall assess the extent to which costs have been incurred prior to definitization of the contract action (also see 217.7404-6(a) and 243.204-70-6). When costs have been incurred prior to definitization, generally regard the contract type risk to be in the low end of the designated range. If a substantial portion of the costs have been incurred prior to definitization, the contracting officer may assign a value as low as zero percent, regardless of contract type. However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize an undefinitized contract action and the contracting officer for such action definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal (as defined in 217.7401), the profit allowed on the contract shall accurately reflect the cost risk of the contractor as such risk existed on the date the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal.
              (ii) Contracting officers shall document in the price negotiation memorandum the reason for assigning a specific contract type risk value, to include the extent to which any reduced cost risk during the undefinitized period of performance was considered, in determining the negotiation objective.
              (3) Above normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value when there is substantial contract type risk. Indicators of this are—
              (i) Efforts where there is minimal cost history;
              (ii) Long-term contracts without provisions protecting the contractor, particularly when there is considerable economic uncertainty;
              (iii) Incentive provisions (e.g., cost and performance incentives) that place a high degree of risk on the contractor;
              (iv) FMS sales (other than those under DoD cooperative logistics support arrangements or those made from U.S. Government inventories or stocks) where the contractor can demonstrate that there are substantial risks above those normally present in DoD contracts for similar items; or
              (v) An aggressive performance-based payment schedule that increases risk.
              (4) Below normal conditions. The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value when the contract type risk is low. Indicators of this are—
              (i) Very mature product line with extensive cost history;
              (ii) Relative short-term contracts;
              (iii) Contractual provisions that substantially reduce the contractor's risk;
              (iv) Incentive provisions that place a low degree of risk on the contractor;
              (v) Performance-based payments totaling the maximum allowable amount(s) specified at FAR 32.1004(b)(2); or
              (vi) A performance-based payment schedule that is routine with minimal risk.
              (e) Costs financed. (1) Costs financed equal total costs multiplied by the portion (percent) of costs financed by the contractor.
              (2) Total costs equal Block 20 (i.e., all allowable costs excluding facilities capital cost of money), reduced as appropriate when—
              (i) The contractor has little cash investment (e.g., subcontractor progress payments liquidated late in period of performance);
              (ii) Some costs are covered by special financing provisions, such as advance payments; or
              (iii) The contract is multiyear and there are special funding arrangements.
              (3) The portion that the contractor finances is generally the portion not covered by progress payments, i.e., 100 percent minus the customary progress payment rate (see FAR 32.501). For example, if a contractor receives progress payments at 80 percent, the portion that the contractor finances is 20 percent. On contracts that provide progress payments to small businesses, use the customary progress payment rate for large businesses.
              (f) Contract length factor. (1) This is the period of time that the contractor has a working capital investment in the contract. It—
              (i) Is based on the time necessary for the contractor to complete the substantive portion of the work;

              (ii) Is not necessarily the period of time between contract award and final delivery (or final payment), as periods of minimal effort should be excluded;
              (iii) Should not include periods of performance contained in option provisions; and
              (iv) Should not, for multiyear contracts, include periods of performance beyond that required to complete the initial program year's requirements.
              (2) The contracting officer—
              (i) Should use the following table to select the contract length factor;
              (ii) Should develop a weighted average contract length when the contract has multiple deliveries; and
              (iii) May use sampling techniques provided they produce a representative result.

              (a) Description. This factor focuses on encouraging and rewarding capital investment in facilities that benefit DoD. It recognizes both the facilities capital that the contractor will employ in contract performance and the contractor's commitment to improving productivity.
              (b) Contract facilities capital estimates. The contracting officer shall estimate the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed using—
              (1) An analysis of the appropriate Forms CASB-CMF and cost of money factors (48 CFR 9904.414 and FAR 31.205-10); and
              (2) DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.
              (c) Use of DD Form 1861. See PGI 215.404-71-4(c) for obtaining field pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.
              (1) Purpose. The DD Form 1861 provides a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Application. It—
              (i) Enables the contracting officer to differentiate profit objectives for various types of assets (land, buildings, equipment). The procedure is similar to applying overhead rates to appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine contract overhead costs.
              (ii) Is designed to record and compute the contract facilities capital cost of money and capital employed which is carried forward to DD Form 1547.
              (2) Completion instructions. Complete a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor's cost proposal, establishing cost of money factors, and establishing a prenegotiation objective on cost. Complete the form as follows:
              (i) List overhead pools and direct-charging service centers (if used) in the same structure as they appear on the contractor's cost proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of-measure must be compatible on all three displays.
              (ii) Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or prenegotiation cost objective and list against each overhead pool and direct-charging service center.
              (iii) Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of money factor to get the facilities capital cost of money estimated to be incurred each year. The sum of these products represents the estimated contract facilities capital cost of money for the year's effort.

              (iv) Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum of the yearly amounts.
              
              (v) Since the facilities capital cost of money factors reflect the applicable cost of money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the contract cost of money by that same rate to determine the contract facilities capital employed.
              (d) Preaward facilities capital applications. To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed as follows:
              (1) Cost of Money. (i) Cost Objective. Use the imputed facilities capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to establish a cost objective or the target cost when structuring an incentive type contract. Do not adjust target costs established at the outset even though actual cost of money rates become available during the period of contract performance.
              (ii) Profit Objective. When measuring the contractor's effort for the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation profit objective, restrict the cost base to normal, booked costs. Do not include cost of money as part of the cost base.
              (2) Facilities Capital Employed. Assess and weight the profit objective for risk associated with facilities capital employed in accordance with the profit guidelines at 215.404-71-4.
              (e) Determination. The following extract from the DD Form 1547 has been annotated to explain the process.

              (1) Select a value from the list in paragraph (f) of this subsection using the evaluation criteria in paragraph (g) of this subsection.
              (2) Use the allocated facilities capital attributable to land, buildings, and equipment, as derived in DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.
              (i) In addition to the net book value of facilities capital employed, consider facilities capital that is part of a formal investment plan if the contractor submits reasonable evidence that—
              (A) Achievable benefits to DoD will result from the investment; and
              (B) The benefits of the investment are included in the forward pricing structure.
              (ii) If the value of intracompany transfers has been included in Block 20 at cost (i.e., excluding general and administrative (G&A) expenses and profit), add to the contractor's allocated facilities capital, the allocated facilities capital attributable to the buildings and equipment of those corporate divisions supplying the intracompany transfers. Do not make this addition if the value of intracompany transfers has been included in Block 20 at price (i.e., including G&A expenses and profit).
              (3) Multiply (1) by (2).
              (f) Values: Normal and designated ranges.

              (g) Evaluation criteria. (1) In evaluating facilities capital employed, the contracting officer—
              (i) Should relate the usefulness of the facilities capital to the goods or services being acquired under the prospective contract;
              (ii) Should analyze the productivity improvements and other anticipated industrial base enhancing benefits resulting from the facilities capital investment, including—
              (A) The economic value of the facilities capital, such as physical age, undepreciated value, idleness, and expected contribution to future defense needs; and

              (B) The contractor's level of investment in defense related facilities as compared with the portion of the contractor's total business that is derived from DoD; and
              
              (iii) Should consider any contractual provisions that reduce the contractor's risk of investment recovery, such as termination protection clauses and capital investment indemnification.
              (2) Above normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a higher than normal value if the facilities capital investment has direct, identifiable, and exceptional benefits. Indicators are—
              (A) New investments in state-of-the-art technology that reduce acquisition cost or yield other tangible benefits such as improved product quality or accelerated deliveries; or
              (B) Investments in new equipment for research and development applications.
              (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly above normal when there are direct and measurable benefits in efficiency and significantly reduced acquisition costs on the effort being priced. Maximum values apply only to those cases where the benefits of the facilities capital investment are substantially above normal.
              (3) Below normal conditions. (i) The contracting officer may assign a lower than normal value if the facilities capital investment has little benefit to DoD. Indicators are—
              (A) Allocations of capital apply predominantly to commercial item lines;
              (B) Investments are for such things as furniture and fixtures, home or group level administrative offices, corporate aircraft and hangars, gymnasiums; or
              (C) Facilities are old or extensively idle.
              (ii) The contracting officer may assign a value significantly below normal when a significant portion of defense manufacturing is done in an environment characterized by outdated, inefficient, and labor-intensive capital equipment.

              Cost efficiency factor.
              (a) This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to reduce costs. To the extent that the contractor can demonstrate cost reduction efforts that benefit the pending contract, the contracting officer may increase the prenegotiation profit objective by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of total objective cost (Block 20 of the DD Form 1547) to recognize these efforts (Block 29).
              (b) To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract:
              (1) The contractor's participation in Single Process Initiative improvements;
              (2) Actual cost reductions achieved on prior contracts;
              (3) Reduction or elimination of excess or idle facilities;
              (4) The contractor's cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition advocacy programs, technical insertion programs, obsolete parts control programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of functions such as information technology). Metrics developed by the contractor such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, including all direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures may provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the contractor's cost reduction initiatives over time;
              (5) The contractor's adoption of process improvements to reduce costs;
              (6) Subcontractor cost reduction efforts;
              (7) The contractor's effective incorporation of commercial items and processes; or
              (8) The contractor's investment in new facilities when such investments contribute to better asset utilization or improved productivity.
              (c) When selecting the percentage to use for this special factor, the contracting officer has maximum flexibility in determining the best way to evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract. However, the contracting officer shall consider the impact that quantity differences, learning, changes in scope, and economic factors such as inflation and deflation will have on cost reduction.

              Modified weighted guidelines method for nonprofit organizations other than FFRDCs.
              (a) Definition. As used in this subpart, a nonprofit organization is a business entity—
              (1) That operates exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes;
              (2) Whose earnings do not benefit any private shareholder or individual;
              (3) Whose activities do not involve influencing legislation or political campaigning for any candidate for public office; and
              (4) That is exempted from Federal income taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
              (b) For nonprofit organizations that are entities that have been identified by the Secretary of Defense or a Secretary of a Department as receiving sustaining support on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis from a particular DoD department or agency, compute a fee objective for covered actions using the weighted guidelines method in 215.404-71, with the following modifications:
              (1) Modifications to performance risk (Blocks 21-23 of the DD Form 1547). (i) If the contracting officer assigns a value from the standard designated range (see 215.404-71-2(c)), reduce the fee objective by an amount equal to 1 percent of the costs in Block 20 of the DD Form 1547. Show the net (reduced) amount on the DD Form 1547.
              (ii) Do not assign a value from the technology incentive designated range.
              (2) Modifications to contract type risk (Block 24 of the DD Form 1547). Use a designated range of −1 percent to 0 percent instead of the values in 215.404-71-3. There is no normal value.
              (c) For all other nonprofit organizations except FFRDCs, compute a fee objective for covered actions using the weighted guidelines method in 215.404-71, modified as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection.

              215.404-73
              Alternate structured approaches.
              (a) The contracting officer may use an alternate structured approach under 215.404-4(c).
              (b) The contracting officer may design the structure of the alternate, but it shall include—
              (1) Consideration of the three basic components of profit—performance risk, contract type risk (including working capital), and facilities capital employed. However, the contracting officer is not required to complete Blocks 21 through 30 of the DD Form 1547.
              (2) Offset for facilities capital cost of money.
              (i) The contracting officer shall reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective by the amount of facilities capital cost of money under Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 414, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital (48 CFR 9904.414). Cost of money under CAS 417, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction (48 CFR 9904.417), should not be used to reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective. The profit amount in the negotiation summary of the DD Form 1547 must be net of the offset.
              (ii) This adjustment is needed for the following reason: The values of the profit factors used in the weighted guidelines method were adjusted to recognize the shift in facilities capital cost of money from an element of profit to an element of contract cost (see FAR 31.205-10) and reductions were made directly to the profit factors for performance risk. In order to ensure that this policy is applied to all DoD contracts that allow facilities capital cost of money, similar adjustments shall be made to contracts that use alternate structured approaches.

              In developing a fee objective for cost-plus-award-fee contracts, the contracting officer shall—
              (a) Follow the guidance in FAR 16.405-2 and 216.405-2;
              (b) Not use the weighted guidelines method or alternate structured approach;

              (c) Apply the offset policy in 215.404-73(b)(2) for facilities capital cost of money, i.e., reduce the base fee by the amount of facilities capital cost of money; and
              (d) Not complete a DD Form 1547.

              (1) Proportion of retained earnings (as established under generally accepted accounting methods) that relates to DoD contracted effort;
              (2) Facilities capital acquisition plans;
              (3) Working capital funding as assessed on operating cycle cash needs; and
              (4) Provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed ordinary and necessary to the FFRDC.
              (b) Shall, when a fee is considered appropriate, establish the fee objective in accordance with FFRDC fee policies in the DoD FFRDC Management Plan.
              (c) Shall not use the weighted guidelines method or an alternate structured approach.

              Defective certified cost or pricing data.

              (c)(i) When a contractor voluntarily discloses defective pricing after contract award, the contracting officer shall discuss the disclosure with the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). This discussion will assist in the contracting officer determining the involvement of DCAA, which could be a limited-scope audit (e.g., limited to the affected cost elements of the defective pricing disclosure), a full-scope audit, or technical assistance as appropriate for the circumstances (e.g., nature or dollar amount of the defective pricing disclosure). At a minimum, the contracting officer shall discuss with DCAA the following:
              (A) Completeness of the contractor's voluntary disclosure on the affected contract.
              (B) Accuracy of the contractor's cost impact calculation for the affected contract.
              (C) Potential impact on existing contracts, task or deliver orders, or other proposals the contractor has submitted to the Government.
              (ii) Voluntary disclosure of defective pricing is not a voluntary refund as defined in 242.7100 and does not waive the Government entitlement to the recovery of any overpayment plus interest on the overpayments in accordance with FAR 15.407-1(b)(7).
              (iii) Voluntary disclosure of defective pricing does not waive the Government's rights to pursue defective pricing claims on the affected contract or any other Government contract.

              (b) Applicability. (1) DoD policy is that all contractors have acceptable estimating systems that consistently produce well-supported proposals that are acceptable as a basis for negotiation of fair and reasonable prices.
              (2) A large business contractor is subject to estimating system disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements if—
              (i) In its preceding fiscal year, the contractor received DoD prime contracts or subcontracts totaling $50 million or more for which certified cost or pricing data were required; or
              (ii) In its preceding fiscal year, the contractor received DoD prime contracts or subcontracts totaling $10 million or more (but less than $50 million) for which certified cost or pricing data were required and the contracting officer, with concurrence or at the request of the ACO, determines it to be in the best interest of the Government (e.g., significant estimating problems are believed to exist or the contractor's sales are predominantly Government).
              (c) Policy. (1) The contracting officer shall—
              (i) Through use of the clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating System Requirements, apply the disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements to large business contractors meeting the criteria in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section;
              (ii) Consider whether to apply the disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements to large business contractors under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section; and
              (iii) Not apply the disclosure, maintenance, and review requirements to other than large business contractors.
              (2) The cognizant contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor, for contractors subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall—
              (i) Determine the acceptability of the disclosure and approve or disapprove the system: and
              (ii) Pursue correction of any deficiencies.
              (3) The auditor conducts estimating system reviews.
              (4) An acceptable system shall provide for the use of appropriate source data, utilize sound estimating techniques and good judgment, maintain a consistent approach, and adhere to established policies and procedures.
              (5) In evaluating the acceptability of a contractor's estimating system, the contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor, shall determine whether the contractor's estimating system complies with the system criteria for an acceptable estimating system as prescribed in the clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating System Requirements.
              (d) Disposition of findings—(1) Reporting of findings. The auditor shall document findings and recommendations in a report to the contracting officer. If the auditor identifies any significant estimating system deficiencies, the report shall describe the deficiencies in sufficient detail to allow the contracting officer to understand the deficiencies.
              (2) Initial determination. (i) The contracting officer shall review all findings and recommendations and, if there are no significant deficiencies, shall promptly notify the contractor, in writing, that the contractor's estimating system is acceptable and approved; or
              (ii) If the contracting officer finds that there are one or more significant deficiencies (as defined in the clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating System Requirements) due to the contractor's failure to meet one or more of the estimating system criteria in the clause at 252.215-7002, the contracting officer shall—
              (A) Promptly make an initial written determination on any significant deficiencies and notify the contractor, in writing, providing a description of each significant deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the contractor to understand the deficiency;
              (B) Request the contractor to respond in writing to the initial determination within 30 days; and
              (C) Promptly evaluate the contractor's responses to the initial determination, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, and make a final determination.
              (3) Final determination. (i) The contracting officer shall make a final determination and notify the contractor in writing that—
              (A) The contractor's estimating system is acceptable and approved, and no significant deficiencies remain, or
              (B) Significant deficiencies remain. The notice shall identify any remaining significant deficiencies, and indicate the adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action. The contracting officer shall—
              (1) Request that the contractor, within 45 days of receipt of the final determination, either correct the deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the deficiencies;
              (2) Disapprove the system in accordance with the clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating System Requirements; and
              (3) Withhold payments in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, if the clause is included in the contract.
              (ii) Follow the procedures relating to monitoring a contractor's corrective action and the correction of significant deficiencies in PGI 215.407-5-70(e).
              (e) System approval. The contracting officer shall promptly approve a previously disapproved estimating system and notify the contractor when the contracting officer determines that there are no remaining significant deficiencies.
              (f) Contracting officer notifications. The cognizant contracting officer shall promptly distribute copies of a determination to approve a system, disapprove a system and withhold payments, or approve a previously disapproved system and release withheld payments, to the auditor; payment office; affected contracting officers at the buying activities; and cognizant contracting officers in contract administration activities.

              Objective criteria.
              (1) Contracting officers shall use objective criteria to the maximum extent possible to measure contract performance. Objective criteria are associated with cost-plus-incentive-fee and fixed-price-incentive contracts.
              (2) When objective criteria exist but the contracting officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government also to incentivize subjective elements of performance, the most appropriate contract type is a multiple-incentive contract containing both objective incentives and subjective award-fee criteria (i.e., cost-plus-incentive-fee/award-fee or fixed-price-incentive/award-fee).

              (1) Award-fee pool. The award-fee pool is the total available award fee for each evaluation period for the life of the contract. The contracting officer shall perform an analysis of appropriate fee distribution to ensure at least 40 percent of the award fee is available for the final evaluation so that the award fee is appropriately distributed over all evaluation periods to incentivize the contractor throughout performance of the contract. The percentage of award fee available for the final evaluation may be set below 40 percent if the contracting officer determines that a lower percentage is appropriate, and this determination is approved by the head of the contracting activity (HCA). The HCA may not delegate this approval authority.
              (2) Award-fee evaluation and payments. Award-fee payments other than payments resulting from the evaluation at the end of an award-fee period are prohibited. (This prohibition does not apply to base-fee payments.) The fee-determining official's rating for award-fee evaluations will be provided to the contractor within 45 calendar days of the end of the period being evaluated. The final award-fee payment will be consistent with the fee-determining official's final evaluation of the contractor's overall performance against the cost, schedule, and performance outcomes specified in the award-fee plan.
              (3) Limitations.
              
              (i) The cost-plus-award-fee contract shall not be used—
              (A) To avoid—
              (1) Establishing cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts when the criteria for cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts apply; or
              (2) Developing objective targets so a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract can be used; or
              (B) For either engineering development or operational system development acquisitions that have specifications suitable for simultaneous research and development and production, except a cost-plus-award-fee contract may be used for individual engineering development or operational system development acquisitions ancillary to the development of a major weapon system or equipment, where—
              (1) It is more advantageous; and
              (2) The purpose of the acquisition is clearly to determine or solve specific problems associated with the major weapon system or equipment.
              (ii) Do not apply the weighted guidelines method to cost-plus-award-fee contracts for either the base (fixed) fee or the award fee.
              (iii) The base fee shall not exceed three percent of the estimated cost of the contract exclusive of the fee.

              216.601
              Time-and-materials contracts.
              (d) Limitations. (i)(A) Approval of determination and findings for time-and-materials or labor-hour contracts.
              
              (1) Base period plus any option periods is three years or less.
              
              (i) For contracts (including indefinite-delivery contracts) and orders in which the portion of the requirement performed on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis exceeds $1 million, the approval authority for the determination and findings shall be the senior contracting official within the contracting activity. This authority may not be delegated.
              (ii) For contracts (including indefinite-delivery contracts) and orders in which the portion of the requirement performed on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis is less than or equal to $1 million, the determination and findings shall be approved one level above the contracting officer.
              (2) Base period plus any option periods exceeds three years. The authority of the head of the contracting activity to approve the determination and findings may not be delegated.
              (3) Exception. The approval requirements in paragraphs (d)(i)(A)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to contracts that, as determined by the head of the contracting activity—
              (i) Support contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping operations;
              (ii) Facilitate defense against or recovery from conventional, cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attack;
              (iii) Facilitate the provision of international disaster assistance; or
              (iv) Support response to an emergency or major disaster.
              (B) Content of determination and findings. The determination and findings shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify that no other contract type is suitable. At a minimum, the determination and findings shall—
              (1) Include a description of the market research conducted;
              (2) Establish that it is not possible at the time of placing the contract or order to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of certainty;
              (3) Address why a cost-plus-fixed-fee term or other cost-reimbursement, incentive, or fixed-price contract or order is not appropriate; for contracts (including indefinite-delivery contracts) and orders for noncommercial items awarded to contractors with adequate accounting systems, a cost-plus-fixed-fee term contract type shall be preferred over a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract type;
              (4) Establish that the requirement has been structured to minimize the use of time-and-materials and labor-hour requirements (e.g., limiting the value or length of the time-and-materials or labor-hour portion of the contract or order; establishing fixed prices for portions of the requirement); and
              (5) Describe the actions planned to minimize the use of time-and-materials and labor-hour contracts on future acquisitions for the same requirements.
              (C) Indefinite-delivery contracts. For indefinite-delivery contracts, the contracting officer shall structure contracts that authorize time-and-materials orders or labor-hour orders to also authorize orders on a cost-reimbursement, incentive, or fixed-price basis, to the maximum extent practicable.
              (e) Solicitation provisions. Use the provision at FAR 52.216-29, Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal Requirements—Non-Commercial Item Acquisition with Adequate Price Competition, with 252.216-7002, Alternate A, in solicitations contemplating the use of a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract type for non-commercial items if the price is expected to be based on adequate competition.

              General.
              (a) Before awarding a multiyear contract, the head of the agency must compare the cost of that contract to the cost of an annual procurement approach, using a present value analysis. Do not award the multiyear contract unless the analysis shows that the multiyear contract will result in the lower cost (10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(7); section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).
              (b) The head of the agency must provide written notice to the congressional defense committees at least 30 days before termination of any multiyear contract (section 8010 of Division C, Title VIII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).
              (c) Every multiyear contract must comply with FAR 17.104(c), unless an exception is approved through the budget process in coordination with the cognizant comptroller.
              (d)(1) DoD must provide notification to the congressional defense committees at least 30 days before entering into a multiyear contract for certain procurements, including those expected to—
              (i) Employ an unfunded contingent liability in excess of $20 million (see 10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(1)(B)(i)(II), 10 U.S.C. 2306c(d)(1), and section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts);
              (ii) Employ economic order quantity procurement in excess of $20 million in any one year of the contract (see 10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(1)(B)(i)(I) and section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts);
              (iii) Involve a contract for advance procurement leading to a multiyear contract that employs economic order quantity procurement in excess of $20 million in any one year (see 10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(1)(B)(ii) and section 8008(a) of Pub. L. 105-56 and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts); or
              (iv) Include a cancellation ceiling in excess of $135.5 million (see 10 U.S.C. 2306c(d)(4) and 10 U.S.C. 2306b(g)(1)).

              (2) A DoD component must submit a request for authority to enter into a multiyear contract described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section as part of the component's budget submission for the fiscal year in which the multiyear contract will be initiated. DoD will include the request, for each candidate it supports, as part of the President's budget for that year and in the Appendix to that budget as part of proposed legislative language for the appropriations bill for that year (section 8008(b) of Pub. L. 105-56).
              (3) If the advisability of using a multiyear contract becomes apparent too late to satisfy the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the request for authority to enter into a multiyear contract must be—
              (i) Formally submitted by the President as a budget amendment; or
              (ii) Made by the Secretary of Defense, in writing, to the congressional defense committees (see section 8008(b) of Pub. L. 105-56).
              (4) Agencies must establish reporting procedures to meet the congressional notification requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The head of the agency must submit a copy of each notice to the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&L)DPAP), and to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (Program/Budget) (OUSD(C)(P/B)).
              (5) If the budget for a contract that contains a cancellation ceiling in excess of $135.5 million does not include proposed funding for the costs of contract cancellation up to the cancellation ceiling established in the contract—
              (i) The notification required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall include—
              (A) The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;
              (B) The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and

              217.171
              Multiyear contracts for services.
              (a) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for a period of not more than 5 years for the following types of services (and items of supply relating to such services), even though funds are limited by statute to obligation only during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)) . Covered services are—
              (1) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;
              (2) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;

              (3) Specialized training requiring high-quality instructor skills (e.g., training for pilots and aircrew members or foreign language training);
              (4) Base services (e.g., ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal); and
              (5) Environmental remediation services for—
              (i) An active military installation;
              (ii) A military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or
              (iii) A site formerly used by DoD (10 U.S.C. 2306c(b)).
              (b) The head of the agency must be guided by the following principles when entering into a multiyear contract for services:

              (1) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of the plant or equipment. As used in this section, “useful commercial life” means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life, with due consideration given to such factors as the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.
              
              (2) Consider the desirability of obtaining an option to extend the term of the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed 3 years at prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other nonrecurring costs already amortized.
              (3) Consider the desirability of reserving the right to take title, under the appropriate circumstances, to the plant or equipment upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost (10 U.S.C. 2306c(c)).
              (c) Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head of the agency must make a written determination that—
              (1) There will be a continuing requirement for the services consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;
              (2) Furnishing the services will require—
              (i) A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or
              (ii) The incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and
              (3) Using a multiyear contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operations (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)).
              (d) The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for services if the value of the multiyear contract exceeds $678.5 million unless a law specifically provides authority for the contract (10 U.S.C. 2306c(d)(2))().

              217.172
              Multiyear contracts for supplies.
              (a) This section applies to all multiyear contracts for supplies, including weapon systems and other multiyear acquisitions specifically authorized by law (10 U.S.C. 2306b).
              (b) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for supplies if, in addition to the conditions listed in FAR 17.105-1(b), the use of such a contract will promote the national security of the United States (10 U.S.C. 2306b(a)(6)).
              (c) Multiyear contracts in amounts exceeding $678.5 million must be specifically authorized by law in an act other than an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(1)).
              (d) The head of the agency may not initiate a multiyear procurement contract for any system (or component thereof) if the value of the multiyear contract would exceed $678.5 million unless authority for the contract is specifically provided in an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(3)).
              (e) The head of the agency shall not enter into a multiyear contract unless—
              (1) The Secretary of Defense has submitted to Congress a budget request for full funding of units to be procured through the contract;
              (2) In the case of a contract for procurement of aircraft, the budget request includes full funding of procurement funds for production beyond advance procurement activities of aircraft units to be produced in the fiscal year covered by the budget;
              (3) Cancellation provisions in the contract do not include consideration of recurring manufacturing costs of the contractor associated with the production of unfunded units to be delivered under the contract;
              (4) The contract provides that payments to the contractor under the contract shall not be made in advance of incurred costs on funded units; and
              (5) The contract does not provide for a price adjustment based on a failure to award a follow-on contract (section 8010 of Division C, Title VIII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235) and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).
              (f)(1) The head of the agency must not enter into or extend a multiyear contract that exceeds $678.5 million (when entered into or extended) until the Secretary of Defense identifies the contract and any extension in a report submitted to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(5)).

              (2) In addition, for contracts equal to or greater than $678.5 million, the head of the contracting activity must determine that the conditions required by paragraph (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section will be met by such contract, in accordance with the Secretary's certification and determination required by paragraph (h)(2) of this section .
              (g) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for—
              (1) A weapon system and associated items, services, and logistics support for a weapon system (10 U.S.C. 2306b(h)(1)); and

              (2) Advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary to manufacture a weapon system, including advance procurement to achieve economic lot purchases or more efficient production rates (see paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) of this section regarding economic order quantity procurements) (10 U.S.C. 2306b(h)(2)). Before initiating an advance procurement, the contracting officer must verify that it is consistent with DoD policy (e.g., the full funding policy in Volume 2A, chapter 1, of DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation).
              (h) The head of the agency shall ensure that the following conditions are satisfied before awarding a multiyear contract for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority:
              (1) The multiyear exhibits required by DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, are included in the agency's budget estimate submission and the President's budget request.
              (2) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress in writing, by no later than 30 days before entry into such contracts, that each of the conditions in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section is satisfied (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3).
              (i) The Secretary has determined that each of the requirements in FAR 17.105-1, paragraphs (b)(1) through (5), will be met by such contract and has provided the basis for such determination to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(A)).
              (ii) The Secretary's determination under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section was made after the completion of a cost analysis performed by the Defense Cost and Resource Center of the Department of Defense and such analysis supports the findings (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(B)).
              (iii) The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 10 USC 2433(d) within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such contract) will be awarded (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(C)).
              (iv) A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(D)).
              (v) Sufficient funds will be available in the fiscal year in which the contract is to be awarded to perform the contract, and the future-years defense program for such fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without cancellation (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(E)).
              (vi) The contract is a fixed price type contract (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(F)).
              (vii) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates, given the existing tooling and facilities (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(G)). The head of the agency shall submit to OUSD(C)(P/B) information supporting the agency's determination that this requirement has been met .
              (viii) The head of the agency shall submit information supporting this certification to OUSD(C)(P/B)& for transmission to Congress through the Secretary of Defense.
              (A) The head of the agency shall, as part of this certification, give written notification to the congressional defense committees of—
              (1) The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;
              (2) The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and
              (3) A financial risk assessment of not including the budgeting for costs of contract cancellation (10 U.S.C. 2306b(g)); and
              (B) The head of the agency shall provide copies of the notification to the Office of Management and Budget at least 14 days before contract award.
              (3) The contract is for the procurement of a complete and usable end item (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(5)(A)).
              (4) Funds appropriated for any fiscal year for advance procurement are obligated only for the procurement of those long-lead items that are necessary in order to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete major end items that are programmed under the contract to be acquired with funds appropriated for a subsequent fiscal year (including an economic order quantity of such long-lead items when authorized by law (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(5)(B)).
              (5) The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such certification are not met if the Secretary determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the Secretary provides the basis for such determination with the certification (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(6)).
              (6) The Secretary of Defense may not delegate this authority to make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section or the determination under paragraph (h)(5) of this section to an official below the level of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(7)).
              (7) All other requirements of law are met and there are no other statutory restrictions on using a multiyear contract for the specific system or component . One such restriction may be the achievement of specified cost savings. If the agency finds, after negotiations with the contractor(s), that the specified savings cannot be achieved, the head of the agency shall assess the savings that, nevertheless, could be achieved by using a multiyear contract. If the savings are substantial, the head of the agency may request relief from the law's specific savings requirement (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(4)). The request shall—
              (i) Quantify the savings that can be achieved;
              (ii) Explain any other benefits to the Government of using the multiyear contract;
              (iii) Include details regarding the negotiated contract terms and conditions; and
              (iv) Be submitted to OUSD(AT&L)DPAP for transmission to Congress via the Secretary of Defense and the President.
              (i) The Secretary of Defense may instruct the head of the agency proposing a multiyear contract to include in that contract negotiated priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured over the life of the contract (10 U.S.C. 2306b(j)).
              (j) Any requests for increased funding or reprogramming for procurement of a major system under a multiyear contract shall be accompanied by an explanation of how the request for increased funding affects the determinations made by the Secretary of Defense under 217.172(h)(2) (10 U.S.C. 2306b(m)).

              (b) Limitations. The head of the contracting activity may exercise the authority in paragraph (a) of this section to enter into a contract for a period in excess of 5 years only if the head of the contracting activity determines, on the basis of a business case analysis (see PGI 217.174 for a business case analysis template and guidance) prepared by the requiring activity, that—
              (1) The proposed purchase of electricity under such contract is cost effective; and
              (2) It would not be possible to purchase electricity from the source in an economical manner without the use of a contract for a period in excess of 5 years.
              (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the DoD from using other multiyear contracting authority of DoD to purchase renewable energy.

              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart—
              (a) Implements section 854 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (Pub. L. 108-375), section 801 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Pub. L. 110-181), and section 806 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Pub. L. 111-84); and
              (b) Prescribes policy for the acquisition of supplies and services through the use of contracts or orders issued by non-DoD agencies.
            
            
              217.701
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              
                Assisted acquisition means the type of interagency contracting through which acquisition officials of a non-DoD agency award a contract or a task or delivery order for the acquisition of supplies or services on behalf of DoD.
              
                Direct acquisition means the type of interagency contracting through which DoD orders a supply or service from a Governmentwide acquisition contract maintained by a non-DoD agency.
              
                Governmentwide acquisition contract means a task or delivery order contract that—
              (1) Is entered into by a non-defense agency; and
              (2) May be used as the contract under which property or services are procured for one or more other departments or agencies of the Federal Government.
            
            
              217.770
              Procedures.
              Departments and agencies shall establish and maintain procedures for reviewing and approving orders placed for supplies and services under non-DoD contracts, whether through direct acquisition or assisted acquisition, when the amount of the order exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. These procedures shall include—
              (a) Evaluating whether using a non-DoD contract for the acquisition is in the best interest of DoD. Factors to be considered include—
              (1) Satisfying customer requirements;
              (2) Schedule;
              (3) Cost effectiveness (taking into account discounts and fees). In order to ensure awareness of the total cost of fees associated with use of a non-DoD contract, follow the procedures at PGI 217.770(a)(3); and
              (4) Contract administration (including oversight);
              (b) Determining that the tasks to be accomplished or supplies to be provided are within the scope of the contract to be used;
              (c) Reviewing funding to ensure that it is used in accordance with appropriation limitations; and
              (d) Collecting and reporting data on the use of assisted acquisition for analysis. Follow the reporting requirements in subpart 204.6.

              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart prescribes policy and procedures for exchange of nonexcess personal property concurrent with an acquisition. 40 U.S.C. 503 permits exchange of personal property and application of the exchange allowance to the acquisition of similar property. This subpart does not authorize the sale of nonexcess personal property.

              217.7001
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              (a) Exchange (trade-in) property means property which—
              (1) Is not excess but is eligible for replacement (because of obsolescence, unserviceability, or other reason); and
              (2) Is applied as whole or partial payment toward the acquisition of similar items (i.e., items designed and constructed for the same purpose).
              (b) Property means items that fall within one of the generic categories listed in DoD Manual 4140.01, Volume 9, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Procedures: Materiel Programs.

              217.7002
              Policy.
              DoD policy is to exchange, rather than replace, eligible nonexcess property whenever exchange promotes economical and efficient program accomplishment. Exchange policy, authority, and applicability are governed by—
              (a) The Federal Property Management Regulations issued by the Administrator of the General Services Administration; and
              (b) DoD Manual 4140.01, Volume 9, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Procedures: Materiel Programs.

              217.7003
              Purchase request.
              Ensure that the requiring activity provides all of the following in support of the purchase request—
              (a) A certification that the property is eligible for exchange and complies with all conditions and limitations of DoD Manual 4140.01, Volume 9, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Procedures: Materiel Programs.
              (b) A written determination of economic advantage indicating—
              (1) The anticipated economic advantage to the Government from use of the exchange authority;
              (2) That exchange allowances shall be applied toward, or in partial payment of, the items to be acquired; and
              (3) That, if required, the exchange property has been rendered safe or innocuous or has been demilitarized;
              (c) All applicable approvals for the exchange; and
              (d) A description of the property available for exchange (e.g., nomenclature, location, serial number, estimated travel value).
              [56 FR 36345, July 31, 1991, as amended at 65 FR 39705, June 27, 2000; 77 FR 23632, Apr. 20, 2012; 82 FR 61480, Dec. 28, 2017]
            
            
              217.7004
              Solicitation and award.
              (a) Solicitations shall include a request for offerors to state prices—
              (1) For the new items being acquired without any exchange; and
              (2) For the new items with the exchange (trade-in allowance) for the exchange property listed.
              (b) The contracting officer is not obligated to award on an exchange basis. If the lowest evaluated offer is an offer for the new items without any exchange, the contracting officer may award on that basis and forgo the exchange.
              (c) Exchanges may be made only with the successful offeror. When the successful offer includes an exchange, award one contract for both the acquisition of the new property and the trade-in of the exchange property. The only exception is when the items must be acquired against a mandatory Federal supply schedule contract, in which case, award a separate contract for the exchange.
            
            
              217.7005
              Solicitation provision.
              Use the provision at 252.217-7002, Offering Property for Exchange, when offering nonexcess personal property for exchange. Allow a minimum of 14 calendar days for the inspection period in paragraph (b) of the clause if the exchange property is in the contiguous United States. Allow at least 21 calendar days outside the contiguous United States.

              217.7300
              Scope.
              This subpart implements 10 U.S.C. 2384. It contains policy and procedures for requiring contractors to identify the actual manufacturer of supplies furnished to DoD.
            
            
              217.7301
              Policy.
              Contractors shall identify their sources of supply in contracts for supplies. Contractor identification of sources of supply enables solicitation, in subsequent acquisitions, of actual manufacturers or other suppliers of items. This enhances competition and potentially avoids payment of additional costs for no significant added value.
            
            
              217.7302
              Procedures.
              (a) Whenever practicable, include a requirement for contractor identification of sources of supply in all contracts for the delivery of supplies. The identification shall include—
              (1) The item's actual manufacturer or producer, or all the contractor's sources for the item;
              (2) The item's national stock number (if there is one);
              (3) The item identification number used by—
              (i) The actual manufacturer or producer of the item; or
              (ii) Each of the contractor's sources for the item; and

              (4) The source of any technical data delivered under the contract.
              
              (b) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to contracts that are—
              (1) For commercial items; or
              (2) Valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.

              (1) Using FAR 6.302-5;
              (2) The contracting officer already has the information required by the provision (e.g., the information was obtained under other acquisitions);
              (3) The contract is for subsistence, clothing or textiles, fuels, or supplies purchased and used outside the United States;
              (4) The contracting officer determines that it would not be practicable to require offerors/contractors to provide the information, e.g., nonrepetitive local purchases; or
              (5) The contracting officer determines that the exception at 217.7302(b) applies to all items under the solicitation.
              (b) If appropriate, use the provision at 252.217-7026, Identification of Sources of Supply, or one substantially the same, in service contracts requiring the delivery of supplies.
            
          
          
            Subpart 217.74—Undefinitized Contract Actions
            
              217.7400
              Scope.
              This subpart prescribes policies and procedures implementing 10 U.S.C. 2326.
            
            
              217.7401
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              
                Contract action means an action which results in a contract.
              (1) It includes contract modifications for additional supplies or services.
              (2) It includes task orders and delivery orders.

              (3) It does not include change orders, administrative changes, funding modifications, or any other contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the contract, e.g., engineering change proposals, value engineering change proposals, and over and above work requests as described in subpart 217.77. For policy relating to definitization of change orders, see 243.204-70.
              
                Definitization means the agreement on, or determination of, contract terms, specifications, and price, which converts the undefinitized contract action to a definitive contract.
              
                Qualifying proposal means a proposal that contains sufficient information to enable DoD to conduct meaningful analyses and audits of the information contained in the proposal.
              
                Undefinitized contract action means any contract action for which the contract terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon before performance is begun under the action. Examples are letter contracts, orders under basic ordering agreements, and provisioned item orders, for which the price has not been agreed upon before performance has begun. For policy relating to definitization of change orders, see 243.204-70.

              217.7402
              Exceptions.
              (a) The following undefinitized contract actions (UCAs) are not subject to this subpart. However, the contracting officer shall apply the policy and procedures to them to the maximum extent practicable (also see paragraph (b) of this section):
              (1) Purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.
              (2) Special access programs.
              (3) Congressionally mandated long-lead procurement contracts.

              (b) If the contracting officer determines that it is impracticable to adhere to the procedures of this subpart for a particular contract action that falls within one of the categories in paragraph (a) of this section, the contracting officer shall provide prior notice, through agency channels, electronically via email to the Principal Director, Defense Pricing and Contracting (Contract Policy), at osd.pentagon.ousd-a-s.mbx.dpc-cp@mail.mil.

              217.7403
              Policy.
              DoD policy is that undefinitized contract actions shall—
              (a) Be used only when—
              (1) The negotiation of a definitive contract action is not possible in sufficient time to meet the Government's requirements; and
              (2) The Government's interest demands that the contractor be given a binding commitment so that contract performance can begin immediately.
              (b) Be as complete and definite as practicable under the particular circumstances.
            
            
              217.7404
              Limitations.
              See PGI 217.7404 for additional guidance on obtaining approval to authorize use of an undefinitized contact action, documentation requirements, and other limitations on their use.
              (a) Foreign military sales contracts.
              
              (1) A contracting officer may not enter into a UCA for a foreign military sale unless—
              (i) The UCA provides for agreement upon contractual terms, specifications, and price by the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submits a qualifying proposal; and
              (ii) The contracting officer obtains approval from the head of the contracting activity to enter into a UCA in accordance with 217.7404-1.
              (2) The head of the contracting activity may waive the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a waiver is necessary in order to support any of the following operations:
              (i) A contingency operation.
              (ii) A humanitarian or peacekeeping operation.
              (b) Unilateral definitization by a contracting officer. Any UCA with a value greater than $50 million may not be unilaterally definitized until—
              (1) The earlier of—
              (i) The end of the 180-day period, beginning on the date on which the contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize the contractual terms, specifications, and price; or
              (ii) The date on which the amount of funds expended under the contractual action is equal to more than 50 percent of the negotiated overall not-to-exceed price for the contractual action;
              (2) The head of the contracting activity, without power of redelegation, approves the definitization in writing;
              (3) The contracting officer provides a copy of the written approval to the contractor; and
              (4) A period of 30 calendar days has elapsed after the written approval is provided to the contractor.

              217.7404-1
              Authorization.
              The contracting officer shall obtain approval from the head of the contracting activity before—
              (a) Entering into a UCA. The request for approval must fully explain the need to begin performance before definitization, including the adverse impact on agency requirements resulting from delays in beginning performance.
              (b) Including requirements for non-urgent spare parts and support equipment in a UCA. The request should show that inclusion of the non-urgent items is consistent with good business practices and in the best interest of the United States.
              (c) Modifying the scope of a UCA when performance has already begun. The request should show that the modification is consistent with good business practices and in the best interests of the United States.
            
            
              217.7404-2
              Price ceiling.
              UCAs shall include a not-to-exceed price.
            
            
              217.7404-3
              Definitization schedule.

              (a) UCAs shall contain definitization schedules that provide for definitization by the earlier of—
              
              (1) The date that is 180 days after the contractor submits a qualifying proposal. This date may not be extended beyond an additional 90 days without a written determination by the head of the contracting activity without power of redelegation, the commander of the combatant command concerned, or the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment that it is in the best interests of the military department or the defense agency, the combatant command, or the Department of Defense, respectively, to continue the action; or
              (2) The date on which the amount of funds obligated under the contract action is equal to more than 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price.
              (b) Submission of a qualifying proposal in accordance with the definitization schedule is a material element of the contract. If the contractor does not submit a timely qualifying proposal, the contracting officer may suspend or reduce progress payments under FAR 32.503-6, or take other appropriate action.

              217.7404-4
              Limitations on obligations.
              (a) The Government shall not obligate more than 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price before definitization. However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal before 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price has been obligated by the Government, then the limitation on obligations before definitization may be increased to no more than 75 percent (see 232.102-70 for coverage on provisional delivery payments).
              (b) In determining the appropriate amount to obligate, the contracting officer shall assess the contractor's proposal for the undefinitized period and shall obligate funds only in an amount consistent with the contractor's requirements for the undefinitized period.

              217.7404-5
              Exceptions.
              (a) The limitations in 217.7404-2, 217.7404-3, and 217.7404-4 do not apply to UCAs for the purchase of initial spares.
              (b) The head of an agency may waive the limitations in 217.7404(a), 217.7404-2, 217.7404-3, and 217.7404-4 for UCAs if the head of the agency determines that the waiver is necessary to support—
              (1) A contingency operation; or
              (2) A humanitarian or peacekeeping operation.

              Allowable profit.
              When the final price of a UCA is negotiated after a substantial portion of the required performance has been completed, the head of the contracting activity shall ensure the profit allowed reflects—
              (a) Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs incurred during contract performance before negotiation of the final price. However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize a UCA, and the contracting officer for such action definitizes the contract after the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal, the profit allowed on the contract shall accurately reflect the cost risk of the contractor as such risk existed on the date the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal;
              (b) Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs expected to be incurred during performance of the remainder of the contract after negotiation of the final price; and
              (c) The requirements at 215.404-71-3(d)(2). The risk assessment shall be documented in the price negotiation memorandum.

              Departments and agencies—
              (a) May acquire replenishment parts concurrently with production of the end item.
              (b) Shall provide for full and open competition when fully adequate drawings and any other needed data are available with the right to use for acquisition purposes (see part 227). However—
              (1) When data is not available for a competitive acquisition, use one of the procedures in PGI 217.7504.
              (2) Replenishment parts must be acquired so as to ensure the safe, dependable, and effective operation of the equipment. Where this assurance is not possible with new sources, competition may be limited to the original manufacturer of the equipment or other sources that have previously manufactured or furnished the parts as long as the action is justified. See 209.270 for requirements applicable to replenishment parts for aviation or ship critical safety items.
              (c) Shall follow the limitations on price increases in 217.7505.

              Limitations on price increases.
              This section provides implementing guidance for section 1215 of Public Law 98-94 (10 U.S.C. 2452 note).
              (a) The contracting officer shall not award, on a sole source basis, a contract for any centrally managed replenishment part when the price of the part has increased by 25 percent or more over the most recent 12-month period.
              (1) Before computing the percentage difference between the current price and the prior price, adjust for quantity, escalation, and other factors necessary to achieve comparability.
              (2) Departments and agencies may specify an alternate percentage or percentages for contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.
              (b) The contracting officer may award a contract for a part, the price of which exceeds the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section, if the contracting officer certifies in writing to the head of the contracting activity before award that—
              (1) The contracting officer has evaluated the price of the part and concluded that the price increase is fair and reasonable; or
              (2) The national security interests of the United States require purchase of the part despite the price increase.
              (c) The fact that a particular price has not exceeded the limitation in paragraph (a) of this section does not relieve the contracting officer of the responsibility for obtaining a fair and reasonable price.
              (d) Contracting officers may include a provision in sole source solicitations requiring that the offeror supply with its proposal, price and quantity data on any government orders for the replenishment part issued within the most recent 12 months.

              Additional acquisition flexibilities available to DoD are as follows:
              (a) Circumstances permitting other than full and open competition. Use of the authority at FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency, may be appropriate under certain circumstances. See PGI 206.302-2.
              (b) Use of advance Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR). For urgent requirements, the advance MIPR may be transmitted electronically. See PGI 208.7004-3.
              (c) Use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card. Governmentwide commercial purchase cards do not have to be used for purchases valued at or below the micro-purchase threshold if the place of performance is entirely outside the United States. See 213.270(c)(1).
              (d) Master agreement for repair and alteration of vessels. The contracting officer, without soliciting offers, may issue a written job order for emergency work to a contractor that has previously executed a master agreement, when delay would endanger a vessel, its cargo or stores, or when military necessity requires immediate work on a vessel. See 217.7103-4, 252.217-7010, and PGI 217.7103-4.
              (e) Spare parts breakout program. An urgent immediate buy need not be delayed if an evaluation of the additional information cannot be completed in time to meet the required delivery date. See PGI 217.7506, paragraph 1-105(e).
              (f) Storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous materials. Under certain emergency situations, exceptions apply with regard to the prohibition on storage or disposal of non-DoD-owned toxic or hazardous materials on DoD installations. See 223.7102(a)(3) and (7).
              (g) Authorization Acts, Appropriations Acts, and other statutory restrictions on foreign acquisition. Acquisitions in the following categories are not subject to the restrictions of 225.7002, Restrictions on food, clothing, fabrics, specialty metals, and hand or measuring tools: (1) Acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold; (2) Acquisitions outside the United States in support of combat operations; (3) Acquisitions of perishable foods by or for activities located outside the United States for personnel of those activities; (4) Acquisitions of food, specialty metals, or hand or measuring tools in support of contingency operations, or for which the use of other than competitive procedures has been approved on the basis of unusual and compelling urgency in accordance with FAR 6.302-2; (5) Emergency acquisitions by activities located outside the United States for personnel of those activities; and (6) Acquisitions by vessels in foreign waters. See 225.7002-2.
              (h) Rights in technical data. The agency head may notify a person asserting a restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances (e.g., emergency repair or overhaul) do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. See 227.7102-2; 227.7103-5; 227.7103-13; 227.7104; 227.7203-13; 252.227-7013; 252.227-7014; 252.227-7015; 252.227-7018; and 252.227-7037.
              (i) Tax exemption in Spain. If copies of a contract are not available and duty-free import of equipment or materials is urgent, the contracting officer may send the Joint United States Military Group copies of the Letter of Intent or a similar document indicating the pending award. See PGI 229.7001.
              (j) Electronic submission and processing of payment requests. Exceptions to the use of Wide Area WorkFlow are at 232.7002(a).
              (k) Mortuary services. In an epidemic or other emergency, the contracting activity may obtain services beyond the capacity of the contractor's facilities from other sources. See 237.7003(a) and 252.237-7003.

See 217.7404-5(b).
              (10) Prohibited sources. DoD personnel are authorized to make emergency acquisitions in direct support of U.S. or allied forces deployed in military contingency, humanitarian, or peacekeeping operations in a country or region subject to economic sanctions administered by the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control.

              219.702-70
              Statutory requirements for the Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans.
              (a) Test Program. In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 637 note, DoD has established a test program to determine whether comprehensive subcontracting plans on a corporate, division, or plant-wide basis will reduce administrative burdens while enhancing subcontracting opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. This program is referred to as the Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans (Test Program).
              (b) Eligibility requirements. To become and remain eligible to participate in the Test Program, a business concern is required to have furnished supplies or services (including construction) under at least three DoD contracts during the preceding fiscal year, having an aggregate value of at least $100 million.
              (c) Comprehensive subcontracting plans. (1) The Defense Contract Management Agency will designate the contracting officer who shall negotiate and approve comprehensive subcontracting plans with eligible participants on an annual basis.
              (2) Test Program participants use their comprehensive subcontracting plans, in lieu of individual subcontracting plans, when performing any DoD contract or subcontract that requires a subcontracting plan.
              (d) Assessment. The contracting officer designated to manage the comprehensive subcontracting plan shall conduct a compliance review during the fiscal year after the close of the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable. The contracting officer shall compare the approved percentage or dollar goals to the total, actual subcontracting dollars covered by the comprehensive subcontracting plan.
              (1) If the contractor has failed to meet its approved subcontracting goal(s), the contracting officer shall give the contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising of the potential for assessment of liquidated damages, permitting the contractor to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer period at the contracting officer's discretion) within which to respond. The contracting officer may take the contractor's failure to respond to the notice as an admission that no valid explanation exists.
              (2) The contracting officer shall review all available information to determine whether the contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the plan.
              (3) If, after consideration of all relevant information, the contracting officer determines that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the comprehensive subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision. The contracting officer's final decision shall include the right of the contractor to appeal under the Disputes clause. The contracting officer shall distribute a copy of the final decision to all cognizant contracting officers for the contracts covered under the plan.
              (e) Liquidated damages. The amount of liquidated damages shall be the amount of anticipated damages sustained by the Government, including but not limited to additional expenses of administration, reporting, and contract monitoring, and shall be identified in the comprehensive subcontracting plan. Liquidated damages shall be in addition to any other remedies the Government may have.
              (f) Expiration date. The Test Program expires on December 31, 2017.

L. 102-396 and similar sections in subsequent Defense appropriations acts. Under this authority, subcontracts awarded to such entities may be counted toward the prime contractor's small business subcontracting goal.
              
              (b) A contractor may also rely on the written representation as to status of—
              (i) A historically black college or university or minority institution; or
              (ii) A qualified nonprofit agency for the blind or other severely disabled approved by the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

              General.
              (a) By Partnership Agreement (PA) between the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of Defense (DoD), the SBA has delegated to the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) its authority under paragraph 8(a)(1)(A) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) to enter into 8(a) prime contracts, and its authority under 8(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act to award the performance of those contracts to eligible 8(a) Program participants. However, the SBA remains the prime contractor on all 8(a) contracts, continues to determine eligibility of concerns for contract award, and retains appeal rights under FAR 19.810. The SBA delegates only the authority to sign contracts on its behalf. Consistent with the provisions of the PA, this authority is hereby redelegated to DoD contracting officers. A copy of the PA, which includes the PA's expiration date, is available at PGI 219.800.
              (b) Contracts awarded under the PA may be awarded directly to the 8(a) participant on either a sole source or competitive basis. An SBA signature on the contract is not required.
              (c) Notwithstanding the PA, the contracting officer may elect to award a contract pursuant to the provisions of FAR Subpart 19.8.

              Contracting officer responsibilities.
              Contracting officers must—
              (a) Negotiate an advance agreement on the treatment of developmental assistance costs for either credit or reimbursement if the mentor firm proposes such an agreement, or delegate authority to negotiate to the administrative contracting officer (see FAR 31.109).
              (b) Modify (without consideration) applicable contract(s) to incorporate the clause at 252.232-7005, Reimbursement of Subcontractor Advance Payments—DoD Pilot Mentor-Protégé Program, when a mentor firm provides advance payments to a protégé firm under the Program and the mentor firm requests reimbursement of advance payments.
              (c) Modify (without consideration) applicable contract(s) to incorporate other than customary progress payments for protégé firms in accordance with FAR 32.504(c) if a mentor firm provides such payments to a protégé firm and the mentor firm requests reimbursement.
              (d) Modify applicable contract(s) to establish a contract line item for reimbursement of developmental assistance costs if—
              (1) A DoD program manager or the cognizant Component Director, SBP, has made funds available for that purpose; and
              (2) The contractor has an approved mentor-protégé agreement.
              (e) Negotiate and award a separate contract for reimbursement of developmental assistance costs only if—
              (1) Funds are available for that purpose;
              (2) The contractor has an approved mentor-protégé agreement; and
              (3) The cognizant Component Director, SBP, has made a determination in accordance with 219.7102(c)(1)(ii).

              Developmental assistance costs eligible for reimbursement or credit.

              (a) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protégé agreement is distinct from, and must not duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm's subcontracts. The mentor firm must accumulate and charge costs associated with the latter in accordance with its approved accounting practices. Mentor firm costs that are eligible for reimbursement are set forth in appendix I.
              (b) Before incurring any costs under the Program, mentor firms must establish the accounting treatment of developmental assistance costs eligible for reimbursement or credit. To be eligible for reimbursement under the Program, the mentor firm must incur the costs not later than September 30, 2021.
              (c) If the mentor firm is suspended or debarred while performing under an approved mentor-protégé agreement, the mentor firm may not be reimbursed or credited for developmental assistance costs incurred more than 30 days after the imposition of the suspension or debarment.
              (d) Developmental assistance costs incurred by a mentor firm not later than September 30, 2021, that are eligible for crediting under the Program, may be credited toward subcontracting plan goals as set forth in appendix I.

              The Defense Contract Management Agency will conduct annual performance reviews of all mentor-protégé agreements as indicated in appendix I, section I-113. The determinations made in these reviews should be a major factor in determinations of amounts of reimbursement, if any, that the mentor firm is eligible to receive in the remaining years of the Program participation term under the agreement.

              Removal of items from contractors' facilities affected by work stoppages.

              (a) When a contractor is unable to deliver urgent and critical items because of a work stoppage at its facility, the contracting officer, before removing any items from the facility, shall—
              (i) Before initiating any action, contact the labor advisor to obtain the opinion of the national office of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or other mediation agency regarding the effect movement of the items would have on labor negotiations. Normally removals will not be made if they will adversely affect labor negotiations.
              (ii) Upon the recommendation of the labor advisor, provide a written request for removal of the material to the cognizant contract administration office. Include in the request the information specified at PGI 222.101-4(a)(ii).
              (iii) With the assistance of the labor advisor or the commander of the contract administration office, attempt to have both the management and the labor representatives involved agree to shipment of the material by normal means.
              (iv) If agreement for removal of the needed items cannot be reached following the procedures in paragraphs (a) (i) through (iii) of this subsection, the commander of the contract administration office, after obtaining approval from the labor advisor, may seek the concurrence of the parties to the dispute to permit movement of the material by military vehicles with military personnel. On receipt of such concurrences, the commander may proceed to make necessary arrangements to move the material.
              (v) If agreement for removal of the needed items cannot be reached following any of the procedures in paragraphs (a) (i) through (iv) of this subsection, refer the matter to the labor advisor with the information required by 222.101-3-70(b). If the labor advisor is unsuccessful in obtaining concurrence of the parties for the movement of the material and further action to obtain the material is deemed necessary, refer the matter to the agency head. Upon review and verification that the items are urgently or critically needed and cannot be moved with the consent of the parties, the agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may order removal of the items from the facility.

              (1) Attempt to have management and labor voluntarily agree to exempt military supplies from the labor dispute by continuing the movement of such material.
              (2) Divert vessels to alternate ports able to provide necessary stevedoring services.
              (3) Consider contracting with reliable alternative sources of supply within the stevedoring industry.
              (4) Utilize civil service stevedores to perform the work performed by contract stevedores.

              Liquidated damages and overtime pay.
              Upon receipt of notification of Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards violations, the contracting officer shall—
              (1) Immediately withhold such funds as are available;
              (2) Give the contractor written notification of the withholding and a statement of the basis for the liquidated damages assessment. The written notification shall also inform the contractor of its 60 days right to appeal the assessment, through the contracting officer, to the agency official responsible for acting on such appeals; and
              (3) If funds available for withholding are insufficient to cover liquidated damages, ask the contractor to pay voluntarily such funds as are necessary to cover the total liquidated damage assessment.
              (d)(i) The assessment shall become the final administrative determination of contractor liability for liquidated damages when—
              (A) The contractor fails to appeal to the contracting agency within 60 days from the date of the withholding of funds;
              (B) The department agency, following the contractor's appeals, issues a final order which affirms the assessment of liquidated damages or waives damages of $500 or less; or
              (C) The Secretary of Labor takes final action on a recommendation of the agency head to waive or adjust liquidated damages in excess of $500.
              (ii) Upon final administrative determination of the contractor's liability for liquidated damages, the contracting officer shall transmit withheld or collected funds determined to be owed the Government as liquidated damages to the servicing finance and accounting officer for crediting to the appropriate Government Treasury account. The contracting officer shall return any excess withheld funds to the contractor.

              222.402-70
              Installation support contracts.
              (a) Apply both the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute to installation support contracts if—
              (1) The contract is principally for services but also requires a substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration, renovation, painting, or repair work; and
              (2) The aggregate dollar value of such construction work exceeds or is expected to exceed $2,000.
              (b) Service Contract Labor Standards statute coverage under the contract. Contract installation support requirements, such as plant operation and installation services (i.e., custodial, snow removal, etc.) are subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards. Apply Service Contract Labor Standards clauses and minimum wage and fringe benefit requirements to all contract service calls or orders for such maintenance and support work.
              
              (c) Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute coverage under the contract. Contract construction, alteration, renovation, painting, and repair requirements (i.e., roof shingling, building structural repair, paving repairs, etc.) are subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute. Apply Construction Wage Rate Requirements clauses and minimum wage requirements to all contract service calls or orders for construction, alteration, renovation, painting, or repairs to buildings or other works.
              (d) Repairs versus maintenance. Some contract work may be characterized as either Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs or Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance. For example, replacing broken windows, spot painting, or minor patching of a wall could be covered by either the Construction Wage Rate Requirements or the Service Contract Labor Standards. In those instances where a contract service call or order requires construction trade skills (i.e., carpenter, plumber, painter, etc.), but it is unclear whether the work required is Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance or Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs, apply the following rules:
              (1) Individual service calls or orders which will require a total of 32 or more work hours to perform shall be considered to be repair work subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements.
              (2) Individual service calls or orders which will require less than 32 work hours to perform shall be considered to be maintenance subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards.
              (3) Painting work of 200 square feet or more to be performed under an individual service call or order shall be considered to be subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute regardless of the total work hours required.
              (e) The determination of labor standards application shall be made at the time the solicitation is prepared in those cases where requirements can be identified. Otherwise, the determination shall be made at the time the service call or order is placed against the contract. The service call or order shall identify the labor standards law and contract wage determination which will apply to the work required.
              (f) Contracting officers may not avoid application of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute by splitting individual tasks between orders or contracts.

              (1) Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute.
              (2) Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute;

              (2) Wages and fringe benefits payments, payrolls, and statements;

              (C) Ensure that the contractor sends a copy of the preconstruction letter to each subcontractor.
              (2) Before construction begins, the contracting officer shall confer with the prime contractor and any subcontractor designated by the prime to emphasize their labor standards obligations under the contract when—
              (A) The prime contractor has not performed previous Government contracts;
              (B) The prime contractor experienced difficulty in complying with labor standards requirements on previous contracts; or
              (C) It is necessary to determine whether the contractor and its subcontractors intend to pay any required fringe benefits in the manner specified in the wage determination or to elect a different method of payment. If the latter, inform the contractor of the requirements of FAR 22.406-2.

              (1) It has 60 days after receipt of the notice to appeal the assessment of liquidated damages; and
              (2) The appeal must demonstrate either that the alleged violations did not occur at all, occurred inadvertently notwithstanding the exercise of due care, or the assessment was computed improperly.

              (B) If an appeal is received, the contracting officer shall process the appeal in accordance with department or agency regulations.
              
              (d) Contracting officer's report. Forward a detailed enforcement report or summary report to the agency head in accordance with agency procedures. Include in the report, as a minimum, the information specified at PGI 222.406-8(d).

              (a) Withholding from contract payments. The contracting officer shall contact the labor advisor for assistance when payments due a contractor are not available to satisfy that contractor's liability for Construction Wage Rate Requirements or CWHSS statute wage underpayments or liquidated damages.
              (c) Disposition of contract payments withheld or suspended—(3) Limitation on forwarding or returning funds. When disposition of withheld funds remains the final action necessary to close out a contract, the Department of Labor will retain withheld funds pending completion of an investigation or other administrative proceedings.

              (B) The agency head may recommend to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, that the liquidated damages over $500 be adjusted because the amount assessed is incorrect. The agency head may also recommend the assessment be waived when the violations—
              (1) Were nonwillful or inadvertent; and

              (ii) Secretary of Defense authorization is obtained under the conditions set forth in 223.7104(b).
              (2) When storage, treatment, or disposal of toxic or hazardous materials not owned by DoD is authorized in accordance with this subpart, the contract shall specify the types and quantities of toxic or hazardous materials that may be temporarily stored, treated, or disposed of in connection with the contract or as a result of the authorized use of a DoD facility or space launch facility. All solicitations and contracts shall specify the conditions under which storage, treatment, or disposal is authorized.
              (b) If the contracting officer is uncertain as to whether particular activities are prohibited or fall under one of the exceptions in 223.7104, the contracting officer should seek advice from the cognizant office of counsel.
            
            
              223.7104

              (1) The storage, treatment, or disposal of materials that will be or have been used in connection with an activity of DoD or in connection with a service to be performed on a DoD installation for the benefit of DoD.
              (2) The storage of strategic and critical materials in the National Defense Stockpile under an agreement for such storage with the Administrator of General Services Administration.
              (3) The temporary storage or disposal of explosives in order to protect the public or to assist agencies responsible for Federal, State, or local law enforcement in storing or disposing of explosives when no alternative solution is available, if such storage or disposal is made in accordance with an agreement between the Secretary of Defense and the head of the Federal, State, or local agency concerned.
              (4) The temporary storage or disposal of explosives in order to provide emergency lifesaving assistance to civil authorities.
              (5) The disposal of excess explosives produced under a DoD contract, if the head of the military department concerned determines, in each case, that an alternative feasible means of disposal is not available to the contractor, taking into consideration public safety, available resources of the contractor, and national defense production requirements.
              (6) The temporary storage of nuclear materials or nonnuclear classified materials in accordance with an agreement with the Secretary of Energy.
              (7) The storage of materials that constitute military resources intended to be used during peacetime civil emergencies in accordance with applicable DoD regulations.
              (8) The temporary storage of materials of other Federal agencies in order to provide assistance and refuge for commercial carriers of such material during a transportation emergency.

              (9) The storage of any material that is not owned by DoD, if the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that the material is required or generated in connection with the authorized and compatible use of a facility of DoD, including the use of such a facility for testing material or training personnel.
              
              (10) The treatment and disposal of any toxic or hazardous materials not owned by DoD, if the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that the material is required or generated in connection with the authorized and compatible use of a facility of that military department and the Secretary enters into a contract or agreement with the prospective user that—
              (i) Is consistent with the best interest of national defense and environmental security; and
              (ii) Provides for the prospective user's continued financial and environmental responsibility and liability with regard to the material.
              (11) The storage of any material that is not owned by DoD if the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that the material is required or generated in connection with the use of a space launch facility located on a DoD installation or on other land controlled by the United States.
              (b) The Secretary of Defense may grant an exception to the prohibition in 10 U.S.C. 2692 when essential to protect the health and safety of the public from imminent danger if the Secretary otherwise determines the exception is essential and if the storage or disposal authorized does not compete with private enterprise.

              223.7300
              Definition.
              
                Legacy system, as used in this subpart, means any program that has passed Milestone A in the defense acquisition management system, as defined in DoD Instruction 5000.02.
            
            
              223.7301
              Policy.
              It is DoD policy to minimize hexavalent chromium (an anti-corrosive) in items acquired by DoD (deliverables and construction material), due to the serious human health and environmental risks related to its use. Executive Order 13423, section 3, paragraph (a) requires that the heads of agencies reduce or eliminate the acquisition and use of toxic or hazardous chemicals. Executive Order 13514 requires that the heads of agencies are responsible for “reducing and minimizing the quantity of toxic and hazardous chemicals and materials acquired, used, or disposed of.”
            
            
              223.7302
              Authorities.
              (a) Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management.
              (b) Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance.
            
            
              223.7303
              Prohibition.
              (a) Except as provided in 223.7304 and 223.7305, no contract may include a specification or standard that results in a deliverable or construction material containing more than 0.1 percent hexavalent chromium by weight in any homogeneous material in the deliverable or construction material where proven substitutes are available that provide acceptable performance for the application.
              (b) This prohibition is in addition to any imposed by the Clean Air Act regardless of the place of performance.
            
            
              223.7304
              Exceptions.
              The prohibition in 223.7303 does not apply to—
              (a) Legacy systems and their related parts, subsystems, and components that already contain hexavalent chromium. However, alternatives to hexavalent chromium shall be considered by the appropriate official during system modifications, follow-on procurements of legacy systems, or maintenance procedure updates; and
              (b) Additional sustainment related contracts (e.g., parts, services) for a system in which use of hexavalent chromium was previously approved.
            
            
              223.7305
              Authorization and approval.
              (a) The prohibition in 223.7303 does not apply to critical defense applications if no substitute can meet performance requirements. The DoD policy of April 8, 2009, “Minimizing the Use of Hexavalent Chromium,” contains requirements for weighing hexavalent chromium versus substitutes. DoD Program Managers must consider the following factors—
              (1) Cost effectiveness of alternative materials or processes;
              (2) Technical feasibility of alternative materials or processes;
              (3) Environment, safety, and occupational health risks associated with the use of the hexavalent chromium or substitute materials in each specific application;
              (4) Achieving a DoD Manufacturing Readiness Level of at least eight for any qualified alternative;
              (5) Materiel availability of hexavalent chromium and the proposed alternatives over the projected life span of the system; and

              (6) Corrosion performance difference of alternative materials or processes as determined by agency corrosion subject matter experts.
              
              (b) However, unless an exception in 223.7304 applies, the incorporation of hexavalent chromium in items acquired by DoD shall be specifically authorized at a level no lower than a general or flag officer or a member of the Senior Executive Service from the Program Executive Office or equivalent level, in coordination with the component Corrosion Control and Prevention Executive. Follow the procedures in PGI 223.7305.
            
            
              223.7306
              Contract clause.
              Unless an exception in 223.7304 applies, or use has been authorized in accordance with 223.7305, use the clause at 252.223-7008, Prohibition of Hexavalent Chromium, in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, that are for supplies, maintenance and repair services, or construction. .

              225.101
              General.
              (a) For DoD, the following two-part test determines whether a manufactured end product is a domestic end product:
              (i) The end product is manufactured in the United States; and
              (ii) The cost of its U.S. and qualifying country components exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. This test is applied to end products only and not to individual components.
              (c) Additional exceptions that allow the purchase of foreign end products are listed at 225.103.
            
            
              225.103
              Exceptions.
              (a)(i)(A) Public interest exceptions for certain countries are in 225.872.
              (B) For procurements covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) has determined that it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the Buy American statute to end products that are substantially transformed in the United States.
              (ii)(A) Normally, use the evaluation procedures in subpart 225.5, but consider recommending a public interest exception if the purposes of the Buy American statute are not served, or in order to meet a need set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2533. For example, a public interest exception may be appropriate—
              (1) If accepting the low domestic offer will involve substantial foreign expenditures, or accepting the low foreign offer will involve substantial domestic expenditures;
              (2) To ensure access to advanced state-of-the-art commercial technology; or
              (3) To maintain the same source of supply for spare and replacement parts (also see paragraph (b)(iii)(B) of this section)—
              (i) For an end item that qualifies as a domestic end product; or
              (ii) In order not to impair integration of the military and commercial industrial base.
              (B) Except as provided in PGI 225.872-4, process a determination for a public interest exception after consideration of the factors in 10 U.S.C. 2533—
              (1) At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;
              (2) By the head of the contracting activity for acquisitions with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but less than $1.5 million; or
              (3) By the agency head for acquisitions valued at $1.5 million or more.
              (b)(i) A determination that an article, material, or supply is not reasonably available is required when domestic offers are insufficient to meet the requirement and award is to be made on other than a qualifying country or eligible end product.
              (ii) Except as provided in FAR 25.103(b)(3), the determination shall be approved—
              (A) At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;
              (B) By the chief of the contracting office for acquisitions with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but less than $1.5 million; or

              (C) By the head of the contracting activity or immediate deputy for acquisitions valued at $1.5 million or more.
              
              (iii) A separate determination as to whether an article is reasonably available is not required for the following articles. DoD has already determined that these articles are not reasonably available from domestic sources:
              (A) Spare or replacement parts that must be acquired from the original foreign manufacturer or supplier.
              (B) Foreign drugs acquired by the Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia, when the Director, Pharmaceuticals Group, Directorate of Medical Materiel, determines that only the requested foreign drug will fulfill the requirements.
              (iv) Under coordinated acquisition (see Subpart 208.70), the determination is the responsibility of the requiring department when the requiring department specifies acquisition of a foreign end product.
              (c) The cost of a domestic end product is unreasonable if it is not the low evaluated offer when evaluated under Subpart 225.5.

              225.401
              Exceptions.
              (a)(2)(A) If a department or agency considers an individual acquisition of a product to be indispensable for national security or national defense purposes and appropriate for exclusion from the provisions of FAR subpart 25.4, it may submit a request with supporting rationale to the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (OUSD(AT&L)DPAP). Approval by OUSD(AT&L)DPAP is not required if—
              (1) Purchase from foreign sources is restricted by statute (see subpart 225.70);
              (2) Another exception in FAR 25.401 applies to the acquisition; or
              (3) Competition from foreign sources is restricted under subpart 225.71.

              (B) Public interest exceptions for certain countries when acquiring products or services in support of operations in Afghanistan are in 225.7704-1.

              225.401-70
              End products subject to trade agreements.
              Acquisitions of end products in the following product service groups (PSGs) are covered by trade agreements if the value of the acquisition is at or above the applicable trade agreement threshold and no exception applies. If an end product is not in one of the listed groups, the trade agreements do not apply. The definition of Caribbean Basin country end products in FAR 25.003 excludes those end products that are not eligible for duty-free treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). Therefore certain watches, watch parts, and luggage from certain Caribbean Basin countries are not eligible products. However, 225.003 expands the definition of Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum and any product derived from petroleum, in accordance with Section 8094 of Pub. L. 103-139.

              (i) The contracting officer determines that offers of U.S.-made, qualifying country, or designated country end products from responsive, responsible offerors are either—
              (A) Not received; or

              (ii) A national interest waiver under 19 U.S.C. 2512(b)(2) is granted on a case-by-case basis. Except as delegated in paragraphs (c)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, submit any request for a national interest waiver to the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy in accordance with department or agency procedures. Include supporting rationale with the request.
              (A) The head of the contracting activity may approve a national interest waiver for a purchase by an overseas purchasing activity, if the waiver is supported by a written statement from the requiring activity that the products being acquired are critical for the support of U.S. forces stationed abroad.
              (B) The Commander or Director, Defense Energy Support Center, may approve national interest waivers for purchases of fuel for use by U.S. forces overseas; or

              225.502
              Application.
              (a) Whenever the acquisition is in support of operations in Afghanistan, treat the offers of end products from South Caucasus or Central and South Asian states listed in 225.401-70 the same as qualifying country offers.
              (b) Use the following procedures instead of the procedures in FAR 25.502(b) for acquisitions subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement:
              (i) Consider only offers of U.S.-made, qualifying country, or designated country end products, except as permitted by 225.403 or 225.7703-1.
              (ii) If price is the determining factor, award on the low offer.
              (c) Use the following procedures instead of those in FAR 25.502(c) for acquisitions subject to the Buy American statute or the Balance of Payments Program:

              (i)(A) If the acquisition is subject only to the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program, then only qualifying country end products are exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.
              (B) If the acquisition is also subject to a Free Trade Agreement, then eligible products of the applicable Free Trade Agreement country are also exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.
              (ii) If price is the determining factor, use the following procedures:
              (A) If the low offer is a domestic offer, award on that offer.
              (B) If there are no domestic offers, award on the low offer (see example in 225.504(1)).
              (C) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, award on that offer. (If the low offer is a qualifying country offer from a country listed at 225.872-1(b), execute a determination in accordance with 225.872-4.)
              (D) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is not exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, and there is another foreign offer that is exempt and is lower than the lowest domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer (see example in 225.504(2)).
              (E) Otherwise, apply the 50 percent evaluation factor to the low foreign offer.
              (1) If the price of the low domestic offer is less than the evaluated price of the low foreign offer, award on the low domestic offer (see example in 225.504(3)).
              (2) If the evaluated price of the low foreign offer remains less than the low domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer (see example in 225.504(4)).
              (iii) If price is not the determining factor, use the following procedures:
              (A) If there are domestic offers, apply the 50 percent Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor to all foreign offers unless an exemption applies.
              (B) Evaluate in accordance with the criteria of the solicitation.
              (C) If these procedures will not result in award on a domestic offer, reevaluate offers without the 50 percent factor. If this will result in award on an offer to which the Buy American statute or Balance of Payments Program applies, but evaluation in accordance with paragraph (c)(ii) of this section would result in award on a domestic offer, proceed with award only after execution of a determination in accordance with 225.103(a)(ii)(B), that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest.
              (iv) If the solicitation includes the provision at 252.225-7023, Preference for Products or Services from Afghanistan, use the evaluation procedures at 225.7703-3.

              Do not acquire items covered by the USML or the 600 series of the CCL, through a contract or subcontract at any tier, from any Communist Chinese military company.

              Exceptions.
              The prohibition in 225.770-2 does not apply to items acquired—

              Identifying items covered by the USML or the 600 series of the CCL.
              (a) Before issuance of a solicitation, the requiring activity will notify the contracting officer in writing whether the items to be acquired are covered by the USML or the 600 series of the CCL. The notification will identify any covered item(s) and will provide the pertinent USML reference(s) from 22 CFR part 121 or the 600 series of the CCL references from 15 CFR part 774, supplement no. 1.

              (b) The USML includes defense articles and defense services that fall into 21 categories. The CCL includes ten categories and five product groups in each category, many of which contain 600 series items. Since not all items covered by the USML or 600 series of the CCL are themselves munitions (e.g., protective personnel equipment, military training equipment), the requiring activity should consult the USML and the 600 series of the CCL before concluding that an item is or is not covered. See PGI 225.770-4.

              Contracting officers considering the purchase of an item from a foreign source may encounter a request for the signing of a certificate to indicate that the Armed Forces of the United States is the end user of the item, and that the U.S. Government will not transfer the item to third parties without authorization from the Government of the country selling the item.

              (a) The Canadian government guarantees to the U.S. Government all commitments, obligations, and covenants of the Canadian Commercial Corporation under any contract or order issued to the Corporation by any contracting office of the U.S. Government. The Canadian government has waived notice of any change or modification that may be made, from time to time, in these commitments, obligations, or covenants.

              225.870-3
              Submission of offers.
              (a) As indicated in 225.870-4, the Canadian Commercial Corporation is the prime contractor. To indicate acceptance of offers by individual Canadian companies, the Canadian Commercial Corporation issues a letter supporting the Canadian offer and containing the following information:
              (1) Name of the Canadian offeror.
              (2) Confirmation and endorsement of the offer in the name of the Canadian Commercial Corporation.
              (3) A statement that the Corporation shall subcontract 100 percent with the offeror.
              (b) When a Canadian offer cannot be processed through the Canadian Commercial Corporation in time to meet the date for receipt of offers, the Corporation may permit Canadian firms to submit offers directly. However, the contracting officer shall receive the Canadian Commercial Corporation's endorsement before contract award.
              (c) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will submit all sealed bids in terms of U.S. currency. Do not adjust contracts awarded under sealed bidding for losses or gains from fluctuation in exchange rates.

              (d) Except for sealed bids, the Canadian Commercial Corporation normally will submit offers and quotations in terms of Canadian currency. The Corporation may, at the time of submitting an offer, elect to quote and receive payment in terms of U.S. currency, in which case the contract—
              (1) Shall provide for payment in U.S. currency; and
              (2) Shall not be adjusted for losses or gains from fluctuation in exchange rates.
            
            
              225.870-4
              Contracting procedures.
              (a) Except for contracts described in 225.870-1(c)(1) through (4), award individual contracts covering purchases from suppliers located in Canada to the Canadian Commercial Corporation, 350 Albert Street, Suite 700, Ottawa, ON K1R 1A4.
              (b) Direct communication with the Canadian supplier is authorized and encouraged in connection with all technical aspects of the contract, provided the Corporation's approval is obtained on any matters involving changes to the contract.
              (c) Requirement for data other than certified cost or pricing data. (1) DoD has waived the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data for the Canadian Commercial Corporation and its subcontractors (see 215.403-1(c)(4)(C)).
              (2) The Canadian Commercial Corporation is not exempt from the requirement to submit data other than certified cost or pricing data, as defined in FAR 2.101. In accordance with FAR 15.403-3(a)(1)(ii), the contracting officer shall require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data from the offeror, to the extent necessary to determine a fair and reasonable price.
              (i) No further approval is required to request data other than certified cost or pricing data from the Canadian Commercial Corporation in the following circumstances:
              (A) In a solicitation for a sole source acquisition that is—
              (1) Cost-reimbursement, if the contract value is expected to exceed $700,000; or
              (2) Fixed-price, if the contract value is expected to exceed $500 million.
              (B) If the Canadian Commercial Corporation submits the only offer in response to a competitive solicitation that meets the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
              (C) For modifications that exceed $150,000 in contracts that meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.
              (D) In competitive solicitations in which data other than certified cost or pricing data are required from all offerors.
              (ii) In any circumstances other than those specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the contracting officer shall only require data other than certified cost or pricing data from the Canadian Commercial Corporation if the head of the contracting activity, or designee no lower than two levels above the contracting officer, determines that data other than certified cost or pricing data are needed (or in the case of modifications that it is reasonably certain that data other than certified cost or pricing data will be needed) in order to determine that the price is fair and reasonable) (see FAR 15.403-3(a).
              (3) The contracting officer shall use the provision at 252.215-7003, Requirement for Submission of Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data—Canadian Commercial Corporation, and the clause at 252.215-7004, Requirement for Submission of Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data—Modifications—Canadian Commercial Corporation, as prescribed at 215.408(2)(i) and (ii), respectively.
              (4) Except for contracts described in 225.870-1(c)(1) through (4), Canadian suppliers will provide required data other than certified cost or pricing data exclusively through the Canadian Commercial Corporation.
              (5) As specified in FAR 15.403-3(a)(4), an offeror who does not comply with a requirement to submit data that the contracting officer has deemed necessary to determine price reasonableness or cost realism is ineligible for award, unless the head of the contracting activity determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to make the award to that offeror, based on consideration of the following:
              (i) The effort made to obtain the data.
              (ii) The need for the item or service.
              
              (iii) Increased cost or significant harm to the Government if award is not made.
              (d) Identify in the contract, the type of currency, i.e., U.S. or Canadian. Contracts that provide for payment in Canadian currency shall—

              (1) Quote the contract price in terms of Canadian dollars and identify the amount by the initials “CN”, e.g., $1,647.23CN; and
              (2) Clearly indicate on the face of the contract the U.S./Canadian conversion rate at the time of award and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Canadian dollar contract amount.

              225.872-2
              Applicability.
              (a) This section applies to all acquisitions of supplies except those restricted by—
              (1) U.S. National Disclosure Policy, DoDD 5230.11, Disclosure of Classified Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations;
              (2) U.S. defense mobilization base requirements purchased under the authority of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i), except for quantities in excess of that required to maintain the defense mobilization base. This restriction does not apply to Canadian planned producers.
              (i) Review individual solicitations to determine whether this restriction applies.
              (ii) Information concerning restricted items may be obtained from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Industrial Affairs);
              (3) Other U.S. laws or regulations (e.g., the annual DoD appropriations act); and
              (4) U.S. industrial security requirements.
              (b) This section does not apply to construction contracts.
            
            
              225.872-3
              Solicitation procedures.
              (a) Except for items developed under the U.S./Canadian Development Sharing Program, use the criteria for soliciting and awarding contracts to small business concerns under FAR Part 19 without regard to whether there are potential qualifying country sources for the end product. Do not consider an offer of a qualifying country end product if the solicitation is identified for the exclusive participation of small business concerns.
              (b) Send solicitations directly to qualifying country sources. Solicit Canadian sources through the Canadian Commercial Corporation in accordance with 225.870.
              (c) Use international air mail if solicitation destinations are outside the United States and security classification permits such use.
              (d) If unusual technical or security requirements preclude the acquisition of otherwise acceptable defense equipment from qualifying country sources, review the need for such requirements. Do not impose unusual technical or security requirements solely for the purpose of precluding the acquisition of defense equipment from qualifying countries.
              (e) Do not automatically exclude qualifying country sources from submitting offers because their supplies have not been tested and evaluated by the department or agency.
              (1) Consider the adequacy of qualifying country service testing on a case-by-case basis. Departments or agencies that must limit solicitations to sources whose items have been tested and evaluated by the department or agency shall consider supplies from qualifying country sources that have been tested and accepted by the qualifying country for service use.

              (2) The department or agency may perform a confirmatory test, if necessary.
              
              (3) Apply U.S. test and evaluation standards, policies, and procedures when the department or agency decides that confirmatory tests of qualifying country end products are necessary.
              (4) If it appears that these provisions might adversely delay service programs, obtain the concurrence of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics), before excluding the qualifying country source from consideration.
              (f) Permit industry representatives from a qualifying country to attend symposia, program briefings, prebid conferences (see FAR 14.207 and 15.201(c)), and similar meetings that address U.S. defense equipment needs and requirements. When practical, structure these meetings to allow attendance by representatives of qualifying country concerns.

              (2) May consider other relevant information that cannot be made part of the public record consistent with the protection of national security information and confidential business information; and
              (3) Will ensure that any such domestic nonavailability determination and the rationale for the determination are made publicly available to the maximum extent consistent with the protection of national security and confidential business information.

              (6) End items containing a minimal amount of otherwise noncompliant specialty metals (i.e., specialty metals not melted or produced in the United States that are not covered by another exception listed in this paragraph (b)), if the total weight of noncompliant specialty metal does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of all specialty metal in the end item. This exception does not apply to high performance magnets containing specialty metals. See PGI 225.7003-3(b)(6) for a table of applicability of specialty metals restrictions to magnets.
              (c) Compliance for commercial derivative military articles. The restrictions at 225.7003-2(a) do not apply to an item acquired under a prime contract if—
              (1) The offeror has certified, and subsequently demonstrates, that the offeror and its subcontractor(s) will individually or collectively enter into a contractual agreement or agreements to purchase a sufficient quantity of domestically melted or produced specialty metal in accordance with the provision at 252.225-7010; and
              (2) The USD(AT&L), or the Secretary of the military department concerned, determines that the item is a commercial derivative military article (defense agencies see procedures at PGI 225.7003-3(c)). The contracting officer shall submit the offeror's certification and a request for a determination to the appropriate official, through agency channels, and shall notify the offeror when a decision has been made.
              (d) National security waiver. The USD(AT&L) may waive the restrictions at 225.7003-2 if the USD(AT&L) determines in writing that acceptance of the item is necessary to the national security interests of the United States (see procedures at PGI 225.7003-3(d). This authority may not be delegated.
              (1) The written determination of the USD(AT&L)—
              (i) Shall specify the quantity of end items to which the national security waiver applies;
              (ii) Shall specify the time period over which the national security waiver applies; and
              (iii) Shall be provided to the congressional defense committees before the determination is executed, except that in the case of an urgent national security requirement, the determination may be provided to the congressional defense committees up to 7 days after it is executed.
              (2) After making such a determination, the USD(AT&L) will—
              (i) Ensure that the contractor or subcontractor responsible for the noncompliant specialty metal develops and implements an effective plan to ensure future compliance; and
              (ii) Determine whether or not the noncompliance was knowing and willful. If the USD(AT&L) determines that the noncompliance was knowing and willful, the appropriate debarring and suspending official shall consider suspending or debarring the contractor or subcontractor until such time as the contractor or subcontractor has effectively addressed the issues that led to the noncompliance.
              (3) Because national security waivers will only be granted when the acquisition in question is necessary to the national security interests of the United States, the requirement for a plan will be applied as a condition subsequent, and not a condition precedent, to the granting of a waiver.

              DoD may accept articles containing specialty metals that are not in compliance with the specialty metals clause of the contract if—
              (a) Final acceptance takes place before September 30, 2010;
              (b) The specialty metals were incorporated into items (whether end items or components) produced, manufactured, or assembled in the United States before October 17, 2006;
              (c) The contracting officer determines in writing that—
              (1) It would not be practical or economical to remove or replace the specialty metals incorporated in such items or to substitute items containing compliant materials;
              (2) The contractor and any subcontractor responsible for providing items containing non-compliant specialty metals have in place an effective plan to ensure compliance with the specialty metals clause of the contract for future items produced, manufactured, or assembled in the United States; and
              (3) The non-compliance was not knowing or willful;
              (d) The determination is approved by—
              (1) The USD(AT&L); or
              (2) The service acquisition executive of the military department concerned; and

              (e) Not later than 15 days after approval of the determination, the contracting officer posts a notice on the Federal Business Opportunities Web site at http://www.FedBizOpps.gov, stating that a waiver for the contract has been granted under Section 842(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Pub. L. 109-364).

              Solicitation provision and contract clauses.
              (a) Unless the acquisition is wholly exempt from the specialty metals restrictions at 225.7003-2 because the acquisition is covered by an exception in 225.7003-3(a) or (d) (but see paragraph (d) of this subsection)—
              (1) Use the clause at 252.225-7008, Restriction on Acquisition of Specialty Metals, in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, that—
              (i) Exceed the simplified acquisition threshold; and

              (ii) Require the delivery of specialty metals as end items.

              (1) That contain the clause at 252.225-7009; and
              (2) For which the contracting officer anticipates that one or more offers of commercial derivative military articles may be received.
              (c) If an agency cannot reasonably determine at time of acquisition whether some or all of the items will be used in support of combat operations or in support of contingency operations, the contracting officer should not rely on the exception at 225.7003-3(a)(2) or (3), but should include the appropriate specialty metals clause or provision in the solicitation and contract.
              (d) If the solicitation and contract require delivery of a variety of contract line items containing specialty metals, but only some of the items are subject to domestic specialty metals restrictions, identify in the Schedule those items that are subject to the restrictions.

Such use may not, however, exceed the lead time required for acquisition and delivery of busesmanufactured in the United States, Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom.
              (b) The requirement for buses is temporary in nature. For example, to meet a special, nonrecurring requirement or a sporadic and infrequent recurring requirement, buses manufactured outside the United States, Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdommay be used for temporary periods of time. Such use may not, however, exceed the period of time needed to meet the special requirement.
              (c) Buses manufactured outside the United States, Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom are available at no cost to the U.S. Government.
              (d) The acquisition is for an amount at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.

              Waiver of restrictions of 10 U.S.C. 2534.
              (a) When specifically authorized by reference elsewhere in this subpart, the restrictions on certain foreign purchases under 10 U.S.C. 2534(a) may be waived as follows:
              (1)(i) The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (USD(AT&L)), without power of delegation, may waive a restriction for a particular item for a particular foreign country upon determination that—
              (A) United States producers of the item would not be jeopardized by competition from a foreign country, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country; or
              (B) Application of the restriction would impede cooperative programs entered into between DoD and a foreign country, or would impede the reciprocal procurement of defense items under a memorandum of understanding providing for reciprocal procurement of defense items under 225.872, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country.

              (ii) A notice of the determination to exercise the waiver authority shall be published in the Federal Register and submitted to the congressional defense committees at least 15 days before the effective date of the waiver.
              (iii) The effective period of the waiver shall not exceed 1 year.
              (iv) For contracts entered into prior to the effective date of a waiver, provided adequate consideration is received to modify the contract, the waiver shall be applied as directed or authorized in the waiver to—
              (A) Subcontracts entered into on or after the effective date of the waiver; and
              (B) Options for the procurement of items that are exercised after the effective date of the waiver, if the option prices are adjusted for any reason other than the application of the waiver.
              (2) The head of the contracting activity may waive a restriction on a case-by-case basis upon execution of a determination and findings that any of the following applies:
              (i) The restriction would cause unreasonable delays.
              (ii) Satisfactory quality items manufactured in the United States or Canada are not available.
              (iii) Application of the restriction would result in the existence of only one source for the item in the United States or Canada.
              (iv) Application of the restriction is not in the national security interests of the United States.
              (v) Application of the restriction would adversely affect a U.S. company.
              (3) A restriction is waived when it would cause unreasonable costs. The cost of an item of U.S. or Canadian origin is unreasonable if it exceeds 150 percent of the offered price, inclusive of duty, of items that are not of U.S. or Canadian origin.
              (b) In accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the USD(AT&L) has waived the restrictions of 10 U.S.C. 2534(a) for certain items manufactured in the United Kingdom, including air circuit breakers for naval vessels (see 225.7006) and the naval vessel components listed at 225.7010-1.

              (4) Provide to USD(A&S) DASD (Industrial Policy), in accordance with the procedures at PGI 225.7018-4(a)(4)—
              (i) A copy of individual nonavailability determinations with supporting documentation; and
              (ii) Notification when individual waivers are requested, but denied.
              (b) Class nonavailability determinations. A class nonavailability determination (i.e., a nonavailability determinations that applies to more than one contract) requires the approval of the USD(A&S). Follow the procedures at PGI 225.7018-4(b) when submitting a request for a class nonavailability determination.
              (1) At least 30 days before making a nonavailability determination that would apply to more than one contract, the USD(A&S) will, to the maximum extent practicable, and in a manner consistent with the protection of national security and confidential business information—

              (i) Publish a notice on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.FedBizOpps.gov) of the intent to make the nonavailability determination; and
              (ii) Solicit information relevant to such notice from interested parties, including producers of mill products from covered materials.
              (2) The USD(A&S)—
              (i) Will take into consideration all information submitted in response to the notice in making a class nonavailability determination;
              (ii) May consider other relevant information that cannot be made part of the public record consistent with the protection of national security information and confidential business information; and
              (iii) Will ensure that any such nonavailability determination and the rationale for the determination are made publicly available to the maximum extent consistent with the protection of national security and confidential business information.

              (b) Overseas for overseas use; or
              (c) When the quantity acquired exceeds the amount needed to maintain the U.S. defense mobilization base (provided the excess quantity is an economical purchase quantity). The requirement for domestic manufacture does not apply to the quantity above that required to maintain the base, in which case, qualifying country sources may compete.
            
            
              225.7102-3
              Waiver.

              225.7300
              Scope of subpart.
              (a) This subpart contains policies and procedures for acquisitions for foreign military sales (FMS) under the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. Chapter 39). Section 22 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2762) authorizes DoD to enter into contracts for resale to foreign countries or international organizations.
              (b) This subpart does not apply to—
              (1) FMS made from inventories or stocks;
              (2) Acquisitions for replenishment of inventories or stocks; or
              (3) Acquisitions made under DoD cooperative logistic supply support arrangements.

              225.7301
              General.
              (a) The U.S. Government sells defense articles and services to foreign governments or international organizations through FMS agreements. The agreement is documented in a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) (see the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M)).
              (b) Conduct FMS acquisitions under the same acquisition and contract management procedures used for other defense acquisitions.
              (c) Follow the additional procedures at PGI 225.7301(c) for preparation of solicitations and contracts that include FMS requirements.
              (d) See 229.170 for policy on contracts financed under U.S. assistance programs that involve payment of foreign country value added taxes or customs duties.

              Preparation of letter of offer and acceptance.
              For FMS programs that will require an acquisition, the contracting officer shall assist the DoD implementing agency responsible for preparing the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) by—
              (1) Working with prospective contractors to—
              (i) Identify, in advance of the LOA, any unusual provisions or deviations (such as those requirements for Pseudo LOAs identified at PGI 225.7301);
              (ii) Advise the contractor if the DoD implementing agency expands, modifies, or does not accept any key elements of the prospective contractor's proposal;
              (iii) Identify any logistics support necessary to perform the contract (such as those requirements identified at PGI 225.7301); and
              (iv) For noncompetitive acquisitions over $10,000, ask the prospective contractor for information on price, delivery, and other relevant factors. The request for information shall identify the fact that the information is for a potential foreign military sale and shall identify the foreign customer; and
              (2) Working with the DoD implementing agency responsible for preparing the LOA, as specified in PGI 225.7302.

              225.7303
              Pricing acquisitions for FMS.
              (a) Price FMS contracts using the same principles used in pricing other defense contracts. However, application of the pricing principles in FAR parts 15 and 31 to an FMS contract may result in prices that differ from other defense contract prices for the same item due to the considerations in this section.

              (b) If the foreign government has conducted a competition resulting in adequate price competition (see FAR 15.403-1(b)(1)), the contracting officer shall not require the submission of certified cost or pricing data. The contracting officer should consult with the foreign government through security assistance personnel to determine if adequate price competition has occurred.

              225.7303-1
              Contractor sales to other foreign customers.
              If the contractor has made sales of the item required for the foreign military sale to foreign customers under comparable conditions, including quantity and delivery, price the FMS contract in accordance with FAR part 15.
            
            
              225.7303-2
              Cost of doing business with a foreign government or an international organization.
              (a) In pricing FMS contracts where non-U.S. Government prices as described in 225.7303-1 do not exist, except as provided in 225.7303-5, recognize the reasonable and allocable costs of doing business with a foreign government or international organization, even though such costs might not be recognized in the same amounts in pricing other defense contracts. Examples of such costs include, but are not limited to, the following:
              (1) Selling expenses (not otherwise limited by FAR Part 31), such as—
              (i) Maintaining international sales and service organizations;
              (ii) Sales commissions and fees in accordance with FAR Subpart 3.4;
              (iii) Sales promotions, demonstrations, and related travel for sales to foreign governments. Section 126.8 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 126.8) may require Government approval for these costs to be allowable, in which case the appropriate Government approval shall be obtained; and
              (iv) Configuration studies and related technical services undertaken as a direct selling effort to a foreign country.
              (2) Product support and post-delivery service expenses, such as—
              (i) Operations or maintenance training, training or tactics films, manuals, or other related data; and
              (ii) Technical field services provided in a foreign country related to accident investigations, weapon system problems, or operations/tactics enhancement, and related travel to foreign countries.
              (3) Offsets. For additional information see 225.7306.

              (i) An offset agreement is the contractual arrangement between the FMS customer and the U.S. defense contractor that identifies the offset obligation imposed by the FMS customer that has been accepted by the U.S. defense contractor as a condition of the FMS customer's purchase. These agreements are distinct and independent of the LOA and the FMS contract. Further information about offsets and LOAs may be found in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M), chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.9. (http://samm.dsca.mil/chapter/chapter-6).
              (ii) A U.S. defense contractor may recover all costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or international organization if the LOA is financed wholly with foreign government or international organization customer cash or repayable foreign military finance credits.
              (iii) The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or administer the offset agreement or to bear any of the associated costs.
              (iv) Indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary on the part of the contracting officer, provided that the U.S. defense contractor submits to the contracting officer a signed offset agreement or other documentation showing that the FMS customer has made the provision of an indirect offset a condition of the FMS acquisition. FMS customers are placed on notice through the LOA that indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable without any further analysis by the contracting officer.
              (4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the appropriate provisions of FAR part 31; or where the advance understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing, and the agreement contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. Government's own requirement (as distinguished from contracts for FMS).

              (b) Costs not allowable under FAR Part 31 are not allowable in pricing FMS contracts, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this subsection.
              (c) The limitations for major contractors on independent research and development and bid and proposal (IR&D/B&P) costs for projects that are of potential interest to DoD, in 231.205-18(c)(iii), do not apply to FMS contracts, except as provided in 225.7303-5. The allowability of IR&D/B&P costs on contracts for FMS not wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis is limited to the contract's allocable share of the contractor's total IR&D/B&P expenditures. In pricing contracts for such FMS—
              (1) Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing; and
              (2) Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, in determining final cost.
              (d) Under paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), the United States must charge for administrative services to recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the Army Export Control Act.
              (e) The limitations in 231.205-1 on allowability of costs associated with leasing Government equipment do not apply to FMS contracts.

              Contingent fees.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, contingent fees are generally allowable under DoD contracts, provided—
              (1) The fees are paid to a bona fide employee or a bona fide established commercial or selling agency maintained by the prospective contractor for the purpose of securing business (see FAR Part 31 and FAR Subpart 3.4); and
              (2) The contracting officer determines that the fees are fair and reasonable.
              (b)(1) Under DoD 5105.38-M, LOAs for requirements for the governments of Australia, Taiwan, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Thailand, or Venezuela (Air Force) shall provide that all U.S. Government contracts resulting from the LOAs prohibit the reimbursement of contingent fees as an allowable cost under the contract, unless the contractor identifies the payments and the foreign customer approves the payments in writing before contract award (see 225.7307(a)).
              (2) For FMS to countries not listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this subsection, contingent fees exceeding $50,000 per FMS case are unallowable under DoD contracts, unless the contractor identifies the payment and the foreign customer approves the payment in writing before contract award.

              (a) In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2762(d), price FMS wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis on the same costing basis with regard to profit, overhead, IR&D/B&P, and other costing elements as is applicable to acquisitions of like items purchased by DoD for its own use.
              (b) Direct costs associated with meeting a foreign customer's additional or unique requirements are allowable under such contracts. Indirect burden rates applicable to such direct costs are permitted at the same rates applicable to acquisitions of like items purchased by DoD for its own use.

              (c) A U.S. defense contractor may not recover costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or international organization if the LOA is financed with funds made available on a nonrepayable basis.

              FMS customer involvement.
              (a) FMS customers may request that a defense article or defense service be obtained from a particular contractor. In such cases, FAR 6.302-4 provides authority to contract without full and open competition. The FMS customer may also request that a subcontract be placed with a particular firm. The contracting officer shall honor such requests from the FMS customer only if the LOA or other written direction sufficiently fulfills the requirements of FAR Subpart 6.3.
              (b) FMS customers should be encouraged to participate with U.S. Government acquisition personnel in discussions with industry to—
              (1) Develop technical specifications;
              (2) Establish delivery schedules;
              (3) Identify any special warranty provisions or other requirements unique to the FMS customer; and
              (4) Review prices of varying alternatives, quantities, and options needed to make price-performance tradeoffs.
              (c) Do not disclose to the FMS customer any data, including certified cost or pricing data, that is contractor proprietary unless the contractor authorizes its release.
              (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the degree of FMS customer participation in contract negotiations is left to the discretion of the contracting officer after consultation with the contractor. The contracting officer shall provide an explanation to the FMS customer if its participation in negotiations will be limited. Factors that may limit FMS customer participation include situations where—
              (1) The contract includes requirements for more than one FMS customer;
              (2) The contract includes unique U.S. requirements; or
              (3) Contractor proprietary data is a subject of negotiations.
              (e) Do not allow representatives of the FMS customer to—
              (1) Direct the exclusion of certain firms from the solicitation process (they may suggest the inclusion of certain firms);
              (2) Interfere with a contractor's placement of subcontracts; or
              (3) Observe or participate in negotiations between the U.S. Government and the contractor involving certified cost or pricing data, unless a deviation is granted in accordance with subpart 201.4.
              (f) Do not accept directions from the FMS customer on source selection decisions or contract terms (except that, upon timely notice, the contracting officer may attempt to obtain any special contract provisions, warranties, or other unique requirements requested by the FMS customer).
              (g) Do not honor any requests by the FMS customer to reject any bid or proposal.
              (h) If an FMS customer requests additional data concerning FMS contract prices, the contracting officer shall, after consultation with the contractor, provide sufficient data to demonstrate the reasonableness of the price and reasonable responses to relevant questions concerning contract price. This data—
              (1) May include tailored responses, top-level pricing summaries, historical prices, or an explanation of any significant differences between the actual contract price and the estimated contract price included in the initial LOA; and
              (2) May be provided orally, in writing, or by any other method acceptable to the contracting officer.

              Limitation of liability.
              Advise the contractor when the foreign customer will assume the risk for loss or damage under the appropriate limitation of liability clause(s) (see FAR Subpart 46.8). Consider the costs of necessary insurance, if any, obtained by the contractor to cover the risk of loss or damage in establishing the FMS contract price.

All persons must continue to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements outside of DFARS and ITAR concerning the import of defense articles and defense services or the possession or transfer of defense articles, including, but not limited to, regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found at 27 CFR parts 447, 478, and 479, which are unaffected by the DTC Treaties. The Approved Community consists of U.S. entities that are registered with the Department of State and are eligible exporters, the U.S. Government, and certain governmental and commercial facilities in Australia and the United Kingdom that are approved and listed by the U.S. Government. See PGI 225.7902-2 for additional information.

              (a) For all solicitations and contracts that may be eligible for DTC Treaty coverage (see PGI 225.7902-4(1)), the program manager shall identify in writing and submit to the contracting officer prior to issuance of a solicitation and prior to award of a contract—
              (1) The qualifying DTC Treaty Scope paragraph (Article 3(1)(a), 3(1)(b), or 3(1)(d) of the U.S.-Australia DTC Treaty or Article (3)(1)(a), (3(1)(b), or 3(1)(d) of the U.S.-U.K. DTC Treaty); and
              (2) The qualifying defense article(s) using the categories described in 22 CFR 126.16(g) and 22 CFR 126.17(g).

              (b) If applicable, the program manager shall also identify in writing and submit to the contracting officer any specific Part C, DTC Treaty-exempted technology list items, terms and conditions for applicable contract line item numbers (See PGI 225.7902-4(2)).

              (b)(1) Use the clause at 252.225-7047, Exports by Approved Community Members in Performance of the Contract, in solicitations and contracts when—
              (i) Export-controlled items are expected to be involved in the performance of the contract and the clause at 252.225-7048 is used; and
              (ii) At least one contract line item is intended to satisfy a U.S. DoD Treaty-eligible requirement.

              Policy.
              Businesses located in the vicinity of a military installation that is being closed or realigned under a base closure law, including 10 U.S.C. 2687, and small and small disadvantaged businesses shall be provided maximum practicable opportunity to participate in acquisitions that support the closure or realignment, including acquisitions for environmental restoration and mitigation.
            
            
              226.7103
              Procedure.
              In considering acquisitions for award through the section 8(a) program (subpart 219.8 and FAR subpart 19.8) or in making set-aside decisions under subpart 219.5 and FAR subpart 19.5 for acquisitions in support of a base closure or realignment, the contracting officer shall—
              (a) Determine whether there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be received from responsible business concerns located in the vicinity of the military installation that is being closed or realigned.
              (b) If offers can not be expected from business concerns in the vicinity, proceed with section 8(a) or set-aside consideration as otherwise indicated in part 219 and FAR part 19.
              (c) If offers can be expected from business concerns in the vicinity—
              (1) Consider section 8(a) only if at least one eligible 8(a) contractor is located in the vicinity.
              (2) Set aside the acquisition for small business only if at least one of the expected offers is from a small business located in the vicinity.

              226.7104
              Other considerations.

              When planning for contracts for services related to base closure activities at a military installation affected by a closure or realignment under a base closure law, contracting officers shall consider including, as a factor in source selection, the extent to which offerors specifically identify and commit, in their proposals, to a plan to hire residents of the vicinity of the military installation that is being closed or realigned.

              227.670
              Scope.
              This subpart prescribes policy with respect to foreign license and technical assistance agreements.
            
            
              227.671
              General.
              In furtherance of the Military Assistance Program or for other national defense purposes, the Government may undertake to develop or encourage the development of foreign additional sources of supply. The development of such sources may be accomplished by an agreement, often called a foreign licensing agreement or technical assistance agreement, wherein a domestic concern, referred to in this subpart as a “primary source,” agrees to furnish to a foreign concern or government, herein referred to as a “second source;” foreign patent rights; technical assistance in the form of data, know-how, trained personnel of the primary source, instruction and guidance of the personnel of the second source, jigs, dies, fixtures, or other manufacturing aids, or such other assistance, information, rights, or licenses as are needed to enable the second source to produce particular supplies or perform particular services. Agreements calling for one or more of the foregoing may be entered into between the primary source and the Government, a foreign government, or a foreign concern. The consideration for providing such foreign license and technical assistance may be in the form of a lump sum payment, payments for each item manufactured by the second source, an agreement to exchange data and patent rights on improvements made to the article or service, capital stock transactions, or any combination of these. The primary source's bases for computing such consideration may include actual costs; charges for the use of patents, data, or know-how reflecting the primary source's investment in developing and engineering and production techniques; and the primary source's “price” for setting up a second source. Such agreements often refer to the compensation to be paid as a royalty or license fee whether or not patent rights are involved.
            
            
              227.672
              Policy.
              It is Government policy not to pay in connection with its contracts, and not to allow to be paid in connection with contracts made with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the United States Government, charges for use of patents in which it holds a royalty-free license or charges for data which it has a right to use and disclose to others, or which is in the public domain, or which the Government has acquired without restriction upon its use and disclosure to others. This policy shall be applied by the Departments in negotiating contract prices for foreign license technical assistance contracts (227.675) or supply contracts with second sources (227.674); and in commenting on such agreements when they are referred to the Department of Defense by the Department of State pursuant to section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675).
            
            
              
              227.673
              Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between the Government and domestic concerns.
              (a) Contracts between the Government and a primary source to provide technical assistance or patent rights to a second source for the manufacture of supplies or performance of services shall, to the extent practicable, specify the rights in patents and data and any other rights to be supplied to the second source. Each contract shall provide, in connection with any separate agreement between the primary source and the second source for patent rights or technical assistance relating to the articles or services involved in the contract, that—
              (1) The primary source and his subcontractors shall not make, on account of any purchases by the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, any charge to the second source for royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government holds a royalty-free license; or data which the Government has the right to possess, use, and disclose to others; or any technical assistance provided to the second source for which the Government has paid under a contract between the Government and the primary source; and
              (2) The separate agreement between the primary and second source shall include a statement referring to the contract between the Government and the primary source, and shall conform to the requirements of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675-1).
              (b) The following factors, among others, shall be considered in negotiating the price to be paid the primary source under contracts within (a) of this section:
              (1) The actual cost of providing data, personnel, manufacturing aids, samples, spare parts, and the like;
              (2) The extent to which the Government has contributed to the development of the supplies or services, and to the methods of manufacture or performance, through past contracts for research and development or for manufacture of the supplies or performance of the services; and
              (3) The Government's patent rights and rights in data relating to the supplies or services and to the methods of manufacture or of performance.
            
            
              227.674
              Supply contracts between the Government and a foreign government or concern.
              In negotiating contract prices with a second source, including the redetermination of contract prices, or in determining the allowability of costs under a cost-reimbursement contract with a second source, the contracting officer:
              (a) Shall obtain from the second source a detailed statement (see FAR 27.204-1(a)(2)) of royalties, license fees, and other compensation paid or to be paid to a primary source (or any of his subcontractors) for patent rights, rights in data, and other technical assistance provided to the second source, including identification and description of such patents, data, and technical assistance; and
              (b) Shall not accept or allow charges which in effect are—
              (1) For royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government holds a royalty-free license; or
              (2) For data which the Government has a right to possess, use, and disclose to others; or
              (3) For any technical assistance provided to the second source for which the Government has paid under a contract between the Government and a primary source.

              Foreign license and technical assistance agreements between a domestic concern and a foreign government or concern.
            
            
              227.675-1
              International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

              Pursuant to section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934), the Department of State controls the exportation of data relating to articles designated in the United States Munitions List as arms, ammunition, or munitions of war. (The Munitions List and pertinent procedures are set forth in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 CFR, et seq.) Before authorizing such exportation, the Department of State generally requests comments from the Department of Defense. On request of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), each Department shall submit comments thereon as the basis for a Department of Defense reply to the Department of State.
            
            
              227.675-2
              Review of agreements.
              (a) In reviewing foreign license and technical assistance agreements between primary and second sources, the Department concerned shall, insofar as its interests are involved, indicate whether the agreement meets the requirements of §§ 124.07-124.10 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or in what respects it is deficient. Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this subsection provide general guidance.
              (b) When it is reasonably anticipated that the Government will purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the agreement, or that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided for the procurement of the supplies or services, the following guidance applies.
              (1) If the agreement specifies a reduction in charges thereunder, with respect to purchases by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, in recognition of the Government's rights in patents and data, the Department concerned shall evaluate the amount of the reduction to determine whether it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances, before indicating its approval.
              (2) If the agreement does not specify any reduction in charges or otherwise fails to give recognition to the Government's rights in the patents or data involved, approval shall be conditioned upon amendment of the agreement to reflect a reduction, evaluated by the Department concerned as acceptable to the Government, in any charge thereunder with respect to purchases made by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, in accordance with § 124.10 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
              (3) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the second source for data or patent rights to the extent of the Government's rights, the Department concerned shall evaluate the acceptability of the provision before indicating its approval.
              (4) If time or circumstances do not permit the evaluation called for in (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the guidance in (c) of this subsection shall be followed.
              (c) When it is not reasonably anticipated that the Government will purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the agreement nor that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided for the purchase of the supplies or services, then the following guidance applies.
              (1) If the agreement provides for charges to the second source for data or patent rights, it may suffice to fulfill the requirements of § 124.10 insofar as the Department of Defense is concerned if:
              (i) The agreement requires the second source to advise the primary source when he has knowledge of any purchase made or to be made from him by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government;
              (ii) The primary source separately agrees with the Government that upon such advice to him from the second source or from the Government or otherwise as to any such a purchase or prospective purchase, he will negotiate with the Department concerned an appropriate reduction in his charges to the second source in recognition of any Government rights in patents or data; and
              (iii) The agreement between the primary and second sources further provides that in the event of any such purchase and resulting reduction in charges, the second source shall pass on this reduction to the Government by giving the Government a corresponding reduction in the purchase price of the article or service.

              (2) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the second source for data or patent rights to the extent to which the Government has rights, the Department concerned shall:
              (i) Evaluate the acceptability of the provision before indicating its approval; or
              (ii) Explicitly condition its approval on the right to evaluate the acceptability of the provision at a later time.
              (d) When there is a technical assistance agreement between the primary source and the Government related to the agreement between the primary and second sources that is under review, the latter agreement shall reflect the arrangements contemplated with respect thereto by the Government's technical assistance agreement with the primary source.
              (e) Every agreement shall provide that any license rights transferred under the agreement are subject to existing rights of the Government.
              (f) In connection with every agreement referred to in (b) of this section, a request shall be made to the primary source—
              (1) To identify the patents, data, and other technical assistance to be provided to the second source by the primary source or any of his subcontractors,
              (2) To identify any such patents and data in which, to the knowledge of the primary source, the Government may have rights, and
              (3) To segregate the charges made to the second source for each such category or item of patents, data, and other technical assistance.
              Reviewing personnel shall verify this information or, where the primary source does not furnish it, obtain such information from Governmental sources so far as practicable.
              (g) The Department concerned shall make it clear that its approval of any agreement does not necessarily recognize the propriety of the charges or the amounts thereof, or constitute approval of any of the business arrangements in the agreement, unless the Department expressly intends by its approval to commit itself to the fairness and reasonableness of a particular charge or charges. In any event, a disclaimer should be made to charges or business terms not affecting any purchase made by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government.
            
            
              227.676
              Foreign patent interchange agreements.
              (a) Patent interchange agreements between the United States and foreign governments provide for the use of patent rights, compensation, free licenses, and the establishment of committees to review and make recommendations on these matters. The agreements also may exempt the United States from royalty and other payments. The contracting officer shall ensure that royalty payments are consistent with patent interchange agreements.
              (b) Assistance with patent rights and royalty payments in the United States European Command (USEUCOM) area of responsibility is available from HQ USEUCOM, ATTN: ECLA, Unit 30400, Box 1000, APO AE 09128; Telephone: DSN 430-8001/7263, Commercial 49-0711-680-8001/7263; Telefax: 49-0711-680-5732.

Claims must be in writing and should include the following:
              (1) An allegation of infringement;
              (2) A request for compensation, either expressed or implied;
              (3) A citation of the patent or patents alleged to be infringed;
              (4) A sufficient designation of the alleged infringing item or process to permit identification, giving the military or commercial designation, if known, to the claimant;

              (6) As an alternative to (a) (4) and (5) of this section, a declaration that the claimant has made a bona fide attempt to determine the item or process which is alleged to infringe, but was unable to do so, giving reasons, and stating a reasonable basis for his belief that his patent or patents are being infringed.
              (b) In addition to the information listed in (a) of this section, the following material and information is generally necessary in the course of processing a claim of patent infringement. Claimants are encouraged to furnish this information at the time of filing a claim to permit the most expeditious processing and settlement of the claim.
              (1) A copy of the asserted patent(s) and identification of all claims of the patent alleged to be infringed.
              (2) Identification of all procurements known to claimant which involve the alleged infringing item or process, including the identity of the vendor or contractor and the Government procuring activity.
              (3) A detailed identification of the accused article or process, particularly where the article or process relates to a component or subcomponent of the item procured, an element by element comparison of the representative claims with the accused article or process.

              (11) Pertinent prior art known to claimant, not contained in the Patent Office file, particularly publications and foreign art.

              In addition in the foregoing, if claimant can provide a statement that the investigation may be limited to the specifically identified accused articles or processes, or to a specific procurement, it may materially expedite determination of the claim.
              (c) Any department receiving an allegation of patent infringement which meets the requirements of this paragraph shall acknowledge the same and supply the other departments that may have an interest therein with a copy of such communication and the acknowledgement thereof.

              Indirect notice of patent infringement claims.
              (a) A communication by a patent owner to a Department of Defense contractor alleging that the contractor has committed acts of infringement in performance of a Government contract shall not be considered a claim within the meaning of 227.7004 until it meets the requirements specified therein.
              (b) Any Department receiving an allegation of patent infringement which meets the requirements of 227.7004 shall acknowledge the same and supply the other Departments (see 227.7004(c)) which may have an interest therein with a copy of such communication and the acknowledgement thereof.

              An investigation and administrative determination (denial or settlement) of each claim shall be made in accordance with instructions and procedures established by each Department, subject to the following:
              (a) When the procurement responsibility for the alleged infringing item or process is assigned to a single Department or only one Department is the purchaser of the alleged infringing item or process, and the funds of that Department only are to be charged in the settlement of the claim, that Department shall have the sole responsibility for the investigation and administrative determination of the claim and for the execution of any agreement in settlement of the claim. Where, however, funds of another Department are to be charged, in whole or in part, the approval of such Department shall be obtained as required by 208.7002. Any agreement in settlement of the claim, approved pursuant to 208.7002 shall be executed by each of the Departments concerned.

              (b) When two or more Departments are the respective purchasers of alleged infringing items or processes and the funds of those Departments are to be charged in the settlement of the claim, the investigation and administrative determination shall be the responsibility of the Department having the predominant financial interest in the claim or of the Department or Departments as jointly agreed upon by the Departments concerned. The Department responsible for negotiation shall, throughout the negotiation, coordinate with the other Departments concerned and keep them advised of the status of the negotiation. Any agreement in the settlement of the claim shall be executed by each Department concerned.
            
            
              227.7007

              When a claim is denied, the Department responsible for the administrative determination of the claim shall so notify the claimant or his authorized representative and provide the claimant a reasonable rationale of the basis for denying the claim. Disclosure of information or the rationale referred to above shall be subject to applicable statutes, regulations, and directives pertaining to security, access to official records, and the rights of others.
            
            
              227.7008
              Settlement of indemnified claims.
              Settlement of claims involving payment for past infringement shall not be made without the consent of, and equitable contribution by, each indemnifying contractor involved, unless such settlement is determined to be in the best interests of the Government and is coordinated with the Department of Justice with a view to preserving any rights of the Government against the contractors involved. If consent of and equitable contribution by the contractors are obtained, the settlement need not be coordinated with the Department of Justice.

              (b) Readjustment of payments. The clause at 252.227-7002, Readjustment of Payments, shall be inserted in contracts providing for payment of a running royalty.
              (c) Termination. The clause at 252.227-7003, Termination, is an example for use in contracts providing for the payment of a running royalty. This clause may be modified or omitted as appropriate for particular circumstances, but only upon the advice of cognizant patent or legal counsel (see 227.7004(c)).
            
            
              227.7009-3
              Additional clauses—contracts except running royalty contracts.
              The following clauses are examples for use in patent release and settlement agreements, and license agreements not providing for payment by the Government of a running royalty.
              (a) License Grant. Insert the clause at 252.227-7004.
              (b) License Term. Insert one of the clauses at 252.227-7005 Alternate I or Alternate II, as appropriate.
            
            
              227.7009-4
              Additional clauses—contracts providing for payment of a running royalty.

              The clauses set forth below are examples which may be used in patent release and settlement agreements, and license agreements, when it is desired to cover the subject matter thereof and the contract provides for payment of a running royalty.
              
              (a) License grant—running royalty. No Department shall be obligated to pay royalties unless the contract is signed on behalf of such Department. Accordingly, the License Grant clause at 252.227-7006 should be limited to the practice of the invention by or for the signatory Department or Departments.
              (b) License term—running royalty. The clause at 252.227-7007 is a sample form for expressing the license term.
              (c) Computation of royalties. The clause at 252.227-7008 providing for the computation of royalties, may be of varying scope depending upon the nature of the royalty bearing article, the volume of procurement, and the type of contract pursuant to which the procurement is to be accomplished.
              (d) Reporting and payment of royalties. (1) The contract should contain a provision specifying the office designated within the specific Department involved to make any necessary reports to the contractor of the extent of use of the licensed subject matter by the entire Department, and such office shall be charged with the responsibility of obtaining from all procuring offices of that Department the information necessary to make the required reports and corresponding vouchers necessary to make the required payments. The clause at 252.227-7009 is a sample for expressing reporting and payment of royalties requirements.
              (2) Where more than one Department or Government Agency is licensed and there is a ceiling on the royalties payable in any reporting period, the licensing Departments or Agencies shall coordinate with respect to the pro rata share of royalties to be paid by each.
              (e) License to other government agencies. When it is intended that a license on the same terms and conditions be available to other departments and agencies of the Government, the clause at 252.227-7010 is an example which may be used.
            
            
              227.7010
              Assignments.
              (a) The clause at 252.227-7011 is an example which may be used in contracts of assignment of patent rights to the Government.
              (b) To facilitate proof of contracts of assignments, the acknowledgement of the contractor should be executed before a notary public or other officer authorized to administer oaths (35 U.S.C. 261).
            
            
              227.7011
              Procurement of rights in inventions, patents, and copyrights.
              Even though no infringement has occurred or been alleged, it is the policy of the Department of Defense to procure rights under patents, patent applications, and copyrights whenever it is in the Government's interest to do so and the desired rights can be obtained at a fair price. The required and suggested clauses at 252.227-7004 and 252.227-7010 shall be required and suggested clauses, respectively, for license agreements and assignments made under this paragraph. The instructions at 227.7009-3 and 227.7010 concerning the applicability and use of those clauses shall be followed insofar as they are pertinent.
            
            
              227.7012
              Contract format.
              The format at 252.227-7012 appropriately modified where necessary, may be used for contracts of release, license, or assignment.
            
            
              227.7013
              Recordation.
              Executive Order No. 9424 of 18 February 1944 requires all executive Departments and agencies of the Government to forward through appropriate channels to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, for recording, all Government interests in patents or applications for patents.

              227.7102-1
              Policy.
              (a) DoD shall acquire only the technical data customarily provided to the public with a commercial item or process, except technical data that—
              (1) Are form, fit, or function data;
              (2) Are required for repair or maintenance of commercial items or processes, or for the proper installation, operating, or handling of a commercial item, either as a stand alone unit or as a part of a military system, when such data are not customarily provided to commercial users or the data provided to commercial users is not sufficient for military purposes; or
              (3) Describe the modifications made at Government expense to a commercial item or process in order to meet the requirements of a Government solicitation.
              (b) To encourage offerors and contractors to offer or use commercial products to satisfy military requirements, offerors, and contractors shall not be required, except for the technical data described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, to—
              (1) Furnish technical information related to commercial items or processes that is not customarily provided to the public; or
              (2) Relinquish to, or otherwise provide, the Government rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data pertaining to commercial items or processes except for a transfer of rights mutually agreed upon.
              (c) The Government's rights in a vessel design, and in any useful article embodying a vessel design, must be consistent with the Government's rights in technical data pertaining to the design (10 U.S.C. 7317; 17 U.S.C. 1301(a)(3)).

              227.7102-2
              Rights in technical data.
              (a) The clause at 252.227-7015, Technical Data—Commercial Items, provides the Government specific license rights in technical data pertaining to commercial items or processes. DoD may use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose data only within the Government. The data may not be used to manufacture additional quantities of the commercial items and, except for emergency repair or overhaul and for covered Government support contractors, may not be released or disclosed to, or used by, third parties without the contractor's written permission. Those restrictions do not apply to the technical data described in 227.7102-1(a).
              (b) If additional rights are needed, contracting activities must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. The specific additional rights granted to the Government shall be enumerated in a license agreement made part of the contract.

              227.7102-3
              Government right to review, verify, challenge and validate asserted restrictions.
              Follow the procedures at 227.7103-13 and the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, regarding the validation of asserted restrictions on technical data related to commercial items.

              227.7102-4
              Contract clauses.
              (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, use the clause at 252.227-7015, Technical Data-Commercial Items, in all solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, when the Contractor will be required to deliver technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes.
              (2) Use the clause at 252.227-7015 with its Alternate I in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, for the development or delivery of a vessel design or any useful article embodying a vessel design.
              (b) In accordance with the clause prescription at 227.7103-6(a), use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data-Noncommercial Items, in addition to the clause at 252.227-7015, if the Government will have paid for any portion of the development costs of a commercial item. The clause at 252.227-7013 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense.
              (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, in solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items that include the clause at 252.227-7015 or the clause at 252.227-7013.

              227.7103-1
              Policy.
              (a) DoD policy is to acquire only the technical data, and the rights in that data, necessary to satisfy agency needs.
              (b) Solicitations and contracts shall—
              (1) Specify the technical data to be delivered under a contract and delivery schedules for the data;
              (2) Establish or reference procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data;
              (3) Establish separate contract line items, to the extent practicable, for the technical data to be delivered under a contract and require offerors and contractors to price separately each deliverable data item; and
              (4) Require offerors to identify, to the extent practicable, technical data to be furnished with restrictions on the Government's rights and require contractors to identify technical data to be delivered with such restrictions prior to delivery.
              (c) Offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in technical data related to items, components or processes developed at private expense except for the data identified at 227.7103-5(a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9).
              (d) Offerors and contractors shall not be prohibited or discouraged from furnishing or offering to furnish items, components, or processes developed at private expense solely because the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose technical data pertaining to those items may be restricted.
              (e) As provided in 10 U.S.C. 2305, solicitations for major systems development contracts shall not require offerors to submit proposals that would permit the Government to acquire competitively items identical to items developed at private expense unless a determination is made at a level above the contracting officer that—

              (1) The offeror will not be able to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements; or
              
              (2) The offeror's proposal to meet mobilization requirements does not satisfy mobilization needs.
              (f) For acquisitions involving major weapon systems or subsystems of major weapon systems, the acquisition plan shall address acquisition strategies that provide for technical data and the associated license rights in accordance with 207.106(S-70).
              (g) The Government's rights in a vessel design, and in any useful article embodying a vessel design, must be consistent with the Government's rights in technical data pertaining to the design (10 U.S.C. 7317; 17 U.S.C. 1301(a)(3)).
              [60 FR 33471, June 28, 1995, as amended at 72 FR 51189, Sept. 6, 2007; 74 FR 61044, Nov. 23, 2009]
            
            
              227.7103-2
              Acquisition of technical data.
              (a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and requirements personnel to assure that data requirements included in solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7103-1.
              (b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the Government's minimum needs for technical data. Data needs must be established giving consideration to the contractor's economic interests in data pertaining to items, components, or processes that have been developed at private expense; the Government's costs to acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the data; reprocurement needs; repair, maintenance and overhaul philosophies; spare and repair part considerations; and whether procurement of the items, components, or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. When it is anticipated that the Government will obtain unlimited or government purpose rights in technical data that will be required for competitive spare or repair parts procurements, such data should be identified as deliverable data items. Reprocurement needs may not be a sufficient reason to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when items or components can be acquired using performance specifications, form, fit and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of alternate sources which can reasonably be expected to provide such items on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.
              (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for data, data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in the offer.
              (c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts—
              (1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be delivered under the contract and the format and media in which the data will be delivered;
              (2) Establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data item on an exhibit to the contract);
              (3) Identify the prices established for each deliverable data item under a fixed-price type contract;
              (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable data item; and
              (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item of technical data.
            
            
              227.7103-3
              Early identification of technical data to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction or disclosure.
              (a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 requires, to the maximum extent practicable, an identification prior to delivery of any technical data to be delivered to the Government with restrictions on use.
              (b) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitations that include the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, release, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertions to the offer.

              (c) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7013 permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of use, release, or disclosure restrictions. The prescription for the use of that clause and its alternate is at 227.7103-6 (a) and (b).

              227.7103-4
              License rights.
              (a) Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in technical data, including a copyright license, under and irrevocable license granted or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the data not granted to the Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical data do not pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to create the data.
              (1) Techical data pertaining to items, components, or processes. Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions (see 227.7103-5(a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9)), restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense (limited rights). They may not restrict the Government's rights in items, components, or processes developed exclusively at Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government's approval. When an item, component, or process is developed with mixed funding, the Government may use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose the data pertaining to such items, components, or processes within the Government without restriction but may release or disclose the data outside the Government only for government purposes (government purpose rights).
              (2) Technical data that do not pertain to items, components, or processes. Technical data may be created during the performance of a contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components or processes. The Government generally obtains unlimited rights in such data when the data were created exclusively with Government funds, government purpose rights when the data were created with mixed funding, and limited rights when the data were created exclusively at private expense.
              (b) Source of funds determination. The determination of the source of development funds for technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes should be made at any practical sub-item or subcomponent level or for any segregable portion of a process. Contractors may assert limited rights in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a process which otherwise qualifies for limited rights under the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items.
            
            
              227.7103-5
              Government rights.
              The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or limited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items. In unusual situations, the standards rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
              (a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains unlimited rights in technical data that are—
              (1) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;

              (2) Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced in the performance of a contract when the study, analysis, test, or similar work was specified as an element of performance;
              
              (3) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;
              (4) Form, fit, and function data;
              (5) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);
              (6) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the contractor by the Government;
              (7) Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;
              (8) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or
              (9) Data furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—
              (i) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or
              (ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.
              (b) Government purpose rights. (1) The Government obtains government purpose rights in technical data—
              (i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or
              (ii) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
              (2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7013 provides a nominal five-year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party. Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial purposes or when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.
              (3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the development. Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.
              (4) During the government purpose rights period, the government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical data marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or disclose data in which it has government purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless—
              (i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or
              (ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
              (5) When technical data marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252-227-7025, the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.

              (6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that technical data marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data. Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under class agreements shall identify the technical data subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are provided.
              (c) Limited rights. (1) The Government obtains limited rights in technical data—
              (i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or
              (ii) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
              (2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government without the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release, or disclosure that is—
              (i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
              (ii) To a covered Government support contractor; or
              (iii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes.
              (3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure, or use for emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.
              (4) When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, disclose, or have others use the data subject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, the intended recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7, or receive the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, prior to release or disclosure of the limited rights data.
              (d) Specifically negotiated license rights. (1) Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the government or when the government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement. The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept less than limited rights in such data. The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.

              (2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to be obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of the additional rights. Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as—
              (i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or processes;
              (ii) Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; or
              (iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.

              227.7103-6
              Contract clauses.
              (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data-Noncommercial Items, in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver to the Government technical data pertaining to noncommercial items, or pertaining to commercial items for which the Government will have paid for any portion of the development costs (in which case the clause at 252.227-7013 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense). Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are computer software or computer software documentation (see 227.72), commercial items developed exclusively at private expense (see 227.7102-4), existing works (see 227.7105), special works (see 227.7106), or when contracting under the Small Business Innovation Research Program (see 227.7104). Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do not use the clause in architect-engineer and construction contracts.
              (b)(1) Use the clause at 252.227-7013 with its Alternate I in research solicitations and contracts, including research solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—
              (i) In the interest of the government; and
              (ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of the Government.
              (2) Use the clause at 252.227-7013 with its Alternate II in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items, that are for the development or delivery of a vessel design or any useful article embodying a vessel design.
              (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014), for performance of its contract, technical data marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s).
              (d) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver technical data. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data specified in the solicitations as deliverable data items that are the same or substantially the same as data items the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.
              (e) Use the following clauses in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7013:
              (1) 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;

              (2) 252.227-7030, Technical Data—Withholding of Payment; and
              
              (3) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be included in a challenge).

              Use and non-disclosure agreement.
              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure may not be provided to third parties unless the intended recipient completes and signs the use and non-disclosure agreement at paragraph (c) of this subsection prior to release, or disclosure of the data.
              (1) The specific conditions under which an intended recipient will be authorized to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data subject to limited rights or computer software subject to restricted rights must be stipulated in an attachment to the use and non-disclosure agreement.
              (2) For an intended release, disclosure, or authorized use of technical data or computer software subject to special license rights, modify paragraph (1)(d) of the use and non-disclosure agreement to enter the conditions, consistent with the license requirements, governing the recipient's obligations regarding use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure of the data or software.
              (b) The requirement for use and non-disclosure agreements does not apply to Government contractors which require access to a third party's data or software for the performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
              (c) The prescribed use and non-disclosure agreement is:
              
                Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement
                The undersigned, ________ (Insert Name) ________, an authorized representative of the ________ (Insert Company Name) ________, (which is hereinafter referred to as the “Recipient”) requests the Government to provide the Recipient with technical data or computer software (hereinafter referred to as “Data”) in which the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display or disclosure rights are restricted. Those Data are identified in an attachment to this Agreement. In consideration for receiving such Data, the Recipient agrees to use the Data strictly in accordance with this Agreement:
                (1) The Recipient shall—
                (a) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose Data marked with government purpose rights or SBIR data rights legends only for government purposes and shall not do so for any commercial purpose. The Recipient shall not release, perform, display, or disclose these Data, without the express written permission of the contractor whose name appears in the restrictive legend (the “Contractor”), to any person other than its subcontractors or suppliers, or prospective subcontractors or suppliers, who require these Data to submit offers for, or perform, contracts with the Recipient. The Recipient shall require its subcontractors or suppliers, or prospective subcontractors or suppliers, to sign a use and non-disclosure agreement prior to disclosing or releasing these Data to such persons. Such agreement must be consistent with the terms of this agreement.
                (b) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data marked with limited rights legends only as specified in the attachment to this Agreement. Release, performance, display, or disclosure to other persons is not authorized unless specified in the attachment to this Agreement or expressly permitted in writing by the Contractor. The Recipient shall promptly notify the Contractor of the execution of this Agreement and identify the Contractor's Data that has been or will be provided to the Recipient, the date and place the Data were or will be received, and the name and address of the Government office that has provided or will provide the Data.

                (c) Use computer software marked with restricted rights legends only in performance of Contract Number ________ (insert contract number(s)) ________. The recipient shall not, for example, enhance, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the software; time share, or use a computer program with more than one computer at a time. The recipient may not release, perform, display, or disclose such software to others unless expressly permitted in writing by the licensor whose name appears in the restrictive legend. The Recipient shall promptly notify the software licensor of the execution of this Agreement and identify the software that has been or will be provided to the Recipient, the date and place the software were or will be received, and the name and address of the Government office that has provided or will provide the software.
                (d) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose Data marked with special license rights legends (To be completed by the contracting officer. See 227.7103-7(a)(2). Omit if none of the Data requested is marked with special license rights legends).
                (2) The Recipient agrees to adopt or establish operating procedures and physical security measures designed to protect these Data from inadvertent release or disclosure to unauthorized third parties.
                (3) The Recipient agrees to accept these Data “as is” without any Government representation as to suitability for intended use or warranty whatsoever. This disclaimer does not affect any obligation the Government may have regarding Data specified in a contract for the performance of that contract.
                (4) The Recipient may enter into any agreement directly with the Contractor with respect to the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of these Data.
                (5) The Recipient agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, and employees from every claim or liability, including attorneys fees, court costs, and expenses arising out of, or in any way related to, the misuse or unauthorized modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of Data received from the Government with restrictive legends by the Recipient or any person to whom the Recipient has released or disclosed the Data.
                (6) The Recipient is executing this Agreement for the benefit of the Contractor. The Contractor is a third party beneficiary of this Agreement who, in addition to any other rights it may have, is intended to have the rights of direct action against the Recipient or any other person to whom the Recipient has released or disclosed the Data, to seek damages from any breach of this Agreement or to otherwise enforce this Agreement.
                (7) The Recipient agrees to destroy these Data, and all copies of the Data in its possession, no later than 30 days after the date shown in paragraph (8) of this Agreement, to have all persons to whom it released the Data do so by that date, and to notify the Contractor that the Data have been destroyed.
                (8) This Agreement shall be effective for the period commencing with the Recipient's execution of this Agreement and ending upon ____ (Insert Date) ____. The obligations imposed by this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement.

              227.7103-8
              Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of technical data.
              (a) Deferred delivery. Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the Government's interests to defer the delivery of technical data. The clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of technical data identified as “deferred delivery” data at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify which technical data is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such data to permit timely delivery.
              (b) Deferred ordering. Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement for a particular data item(s) has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for the data. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any data that has been generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the data are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the data into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.
            
            
              227.7103-9
              Copyright.
              (a) Copyright license. (1) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, requires a contractor to grant or obtain for the Government license rights which permit the Government to reproduce data, distribute copies of the data, publicly perform or display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in technical data will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data.
              (2) The clause at 252.227-7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted data into a deliverable data item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted data in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.
              (b) Copyright considerations—acquisition of existing and special works. See 227.7105 or 227.7106 for copyright considerations when acquiring existing or special works.
            
            
              227.7103-10
              Contractor identification and marking of technical data to be furnished with restrictive markings.
              (a) Identification requirements. (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify to the contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical data that the offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306. An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.
              (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13.

              (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, permits the contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.
              (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor, nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7103-13, the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
              (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose technical data. However, offerors shall not be prohibited from offering products for which the offeror is entitled to provide the Government limited rights in the technical data pertaining to such products and offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish any greater rights in technical data when the offeror is entitled to provide the technical data with limited rights.
              (b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items—
              (1) Requires a contractor that desires to restrict the Government's rights in technical data to place restrictive markings on the data, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings; and
              (2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any technical data in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in that data unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the data have expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified.
              (c) Unmarked technical data. (1) Technical data delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the request.
              (2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked technical data at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer within six months following the furnishing or delivery of such data, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must:
              (i) Identify the technical data that should have been marked;
              (ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of technical data contained in the clause at 252.227-7013; and
              (iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the technical data made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.
              (3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the technical data were not distributed outside the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.

              227.7103-11
              Contractor procedures and records.

              (a) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered data.
              (b) The clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data requires contractors and their subcontractors at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of restrictive markings on technical data delivered or to be delivered under a Government contract.
            
            
              227.7103-12
              Government right to establish conformity of markings.
              (a) Nonconforming markings. (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227-7013 is also a nonconforming marking.
              (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is not subject to 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return technical data bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming marking at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected data within 60 days following the person's receipt of the data, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at that person's expense. When it is impracticable to return technical data for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction, the data may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.
              (b) Unjustified markings. (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical data. For example, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes that were developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.
              (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either—
              (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or
              (ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the data are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected data to the contracting officer within 60 days following receipt of the data, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.
            
            
              227.7103-13
              Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.
              (a) General. An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in the technical data. Under 10 U.S.C. 2321, the Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion and continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later procure competitively the item to which the data pertain.
              (b) Pre-award considerations. The challenge procedures required by 10 U.S.C. 2321 could significantly delay awards under competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.
              
              (c) Challenge considerations and presumption.
              
              (1) Requirements to initiate a challenge. Contracting officers shall have reasonable grounds to challenge the validity of an asserted restriction. Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the assertion. The contracting officer shall not challenge a contractor's assertion that a commercial item was developed exclusively at private expense unless the Government can demonstrate that it contributed to development of that item.
              (2) Presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense. 10 U.S.C. 2320(b)(1) and 2321(f) establish a presumption and procedures regarding validation of asserted restrictions for technical data related to commercial items, and to major systems, on the basis of development exclusively at private expense.
              (i) Commercial items. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, contracting officers shall presume that a commercial item was developed exclusively at private expense whether or not a contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to a challenge notice. When a challenge is warranted, a contractor's or subcontractor's failure to respond to the challenge notice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction.
              (ii) Major weapon systems. When the contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction regarding technical data for a major weapon system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the technology was not developed exclusively at private expense—
              (A) The presumption in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section applies to—
              (1) A commercial subsystem or component of a major weapon system, if the major weapon system was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(a));
              (2) A component of a subsystem, if the subsystem was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(b)); and
              (3) Any other component, if the component is a commercially available off-the-shelf item or a commercially available off-the-shelf item with modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace or minor modifications made to meet Federal Government requirements; and
              (B) In all other cases, the contracting officer shall sustain the challenge unless information provided by the contractor or subcontractor demonstrates that the item was developed exclusively at private expense.
              (d) Challenge and validation. All challenges shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.
              (1) Challenge period. Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of technical data deliverable under the contract. Assertions must be challenged within three years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the data, whichever is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if the technical data—
              (i) Are publicly available without restrictions;
              (ii) Have been provided to the United States without restriction; or
              (iii) Have been otherwise made available without restriction other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party.
              (2) Pre-challenge requests for information. (i) After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to ascertain the basis of the restrictive markings. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by the person making the assertion does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
              
              (ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information or additional supporting documentation, or if the information submitted or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking does not justify the asserted restriction, a challenge should be considered.
              (3) Transacting matters directly with subcontracts. The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—
              (i) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor;
              (ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or suppliers right to assert restrictions; or
              (iii) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
              (4) Challenge notice. The contracting officer shall not issue a challenge notice unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of an assertion. The contracting officer may challenge an assertion whether or not supporting documentation was requested under paragraph (d)(2) of this subsection. Challenge notices shall be in writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, the person asserting the restriction. The challenge notice shall include the information in paragraph (e) of the clause at 252.227-7037.
              (5) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge notice, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
              (6) Contracting officer's final decision. Contracting officers must issue a final decision for each challenged assertion, whether or not the assertion has been justified.
              (i) A contracting officer's final decision that an assertion is not justified must be issued a soon as practicable following the failure of the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting officer's challenge within 60 days, or any extension to that time granted by the contracting officer.
              (ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response by the person asserting the restriction, determines that an asserted restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the validity of the asserted restriction. If the asserted restriction was made subsequent to submission of the contractor's offer, add the asserted restriction to the contract attachment.
              (iii) A contracting officer who determine that the validity of an asserted restriction has not been justified shall issue a contracting officer's final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227-7037. As provided in paragraph (g) of that clause, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction.
              (7) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.
              (8) Validation. Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency board of contract appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the asserted restriction.

              227.7103-14
              Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of technical data.
              (a) Statutory requirements. 10 U.S.C. 2320—
              (1) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate, or not to satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning such data; and
              (2) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such other remedies an agency head considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.
              (b) Conformity and acceptance. (1) Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements the data must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual requirements.
              (2) The clause at 252.227-7030, Technical Data—Withholding of Payment, provides for withholding up to 10 percent of the contract price pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or negotiation of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be determined giving consideration to the relative value and importance of the data. For example—
              (i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the relative value of that data may be considerably higher than the value of data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a secondary objective; or
              (ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and maintenance data may have a considerably higher relative value than data that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics.
              (3) Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the contractual requirements in all respects. Except for nonconforming restrictive markings (see paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection), correction or replacement of nonconforming data or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with—
              (i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; or
              (ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for nonconforming deliverables.
              (4) Follow the procedures at 227.7103-12(a)(2) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason technical data fail to conform to contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227-7030 may be used to withhold an amount for payment, consistent with the terms of the clause, pending correction of the nonconforming markings.
              (c) Warranty. (1) The intended use of the technical data and the cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered before deciding to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a particular item, component, or process is or is not warranted is not a consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the technical data that pertain to the item, component, or process. For example, a data warranty should be considered if the Government intends to repair or maintain an item and defective repair or maintenance data would impair the Government's effective use of the item or result in increased costs to the Government.
              (2) As prescribed in 246.710, use the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, and its alternates, or a substantially similar clause when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.

              227.7103-15
              Subcontractor rights in technical data.
              (a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 provides subcontractors at all tiers the same protection for their rights in data as is provided to prime contractors. The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, and 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, implement the statutory requirements.
              (b) 10 U.S.C. 2321 permits a subcontractor to transact directly with the Government matters relating to the validation of its asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose technical data. The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains a contractor's agreement that the direct transaction of validation or challenge matters with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercise its right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7103-13(c)(3).
              (c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers, at all tiers, who will be furnishing technical data for non-commercial items in response to a Government requirement:
              (1) 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items;
              (2) 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;
              (3) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government; and
              (4) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.
              (d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government under the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause contained in the contractor's contract with the Government.

              Providing technical data to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations.
              Technical data may be released or disclosed to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations only if release or disclosure is otherwise permitted both by Federal export controls and other national security laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and regulations, the Department of Defense—
              (a) May release or disclose technical data in which it has obtained unlimited rights to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities; and
              (b) Shall not release or disclose technical data for which restrictions on use, release, or disclosure have been asserted to foreign entities, or authorize the use of technical data by those entities, unless the intended recipient is subject to the same provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause at 252.227-7103, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, governing use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data have been satisfied.
            
            
              227.7103-17
              Overseas contracts with foreign sources.
              (a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see paragraph (c) of this subsection), in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, when the Government requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release or disclose all technical data to be delivered under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for existing or special works.

              (b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain rights in the technical data that are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under the data rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.
              (c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate data rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.

              Contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.
              (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7018, Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, when technical data or computer software will be generated during performance of contracts under the SBIR program.
              (b) Under the clause at 252.227-7018, the Government obtains SBIR data rights in technical data and computer software generated under the contract and marked with the SBIR data rights legend. SBIR data rights provide the Government limited rights in such technical data and restricted rights in such computer software during the SBIR data protection period commencing with contract award and ending five years after completion of the project under which the data were generated. Upon expiration of the five-year restrictive license, the Government has unlimited rights in the SBIR technical data and computer software.
              (c) During the SBIR data protection period, the Government may not release or disclose SBIR technical data or computer software to any person except as authorized for limited rights technical data or restricted rights computer software, respectively.
              (d) Use the clause at 252.227-7018 with its Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—
              (1) In the interest of the Government; and
              (2) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of the Government.
              (e) Use the following provision and clauses in SBIR solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7018:
              (1) 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information;

              227.7105-1
              General.

              (a) Existing works include motion pictures, television recordings, video recordings, and other audiovisual works in any medium; sound recordings in any medium; musical, dramatic, and literary works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; and works of a similar nature. Usually, these or similar works were not first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract. Therefore, the Government must obtain a license in the work if it intends to reproduce the work, distribute copies of the work, prepare derivative works, or perform or display the work publicly. When the Government is not responsible for the content of an existing work, it should require the copyright owner to indemnify the Government for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use, or disclosure of such data.
              (b) Follow the procedures at 227.7106 for works which will be first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract and the Government needs to control distribution of the work or has a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, content, performance, use, or disclosure of the work or from libelous or other unlawful material contained in the work. Follow the procedures at 227.7103 when the Government does not need to control distribution of such works or obtain such indemnities.
            
            
              227.7105-2
              Acquisition of existing works without modification.
              (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7021, Rights in Data—Existing Works, in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, in solicitations and contracts exclusively for existing works when—
              (1) The existing works will be acquired without modification; and
              (2) The Government requires the right to reproduce, prepare derivative works, or publicly perform or display the existing works; or
              (3) The Government has a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use, or disclosure of such data.
              (b) The clause at 252.227-7021 provides the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, non-exclusive, irrevocable, world-wide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works and publicly perform or display the works called for by a contract and to authorize others to do so for government purposes.
              (c) A contract clause is not required to acquire existing works such as books, magazines and periodicals, in any storage or retrieval medium, when the Government will not reproduce the books, magazines or periodicals, or prepare derivative works.

              227.7106
              Contracts for special works.
              (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated in the performance of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such works. Use the clause—
              (1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, when the Government must own or control copyright in all works first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract; or
              (2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7013 when the Government must own or control copyright in a portion of a work first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract. The specific portion in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in a special contract requirement.

              (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in a special work under the clause at 252.227-7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.
              (c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any works copyrighted by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, to perform or display publicly any portion of the work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable work.
              (d) Examples of works which may be procured under the Rights in Special Works clause include, but are not limited, to audiovisual works, computer data bases, computer software documentation, scripts, soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories of departments, agencies, services or units thereof; surveys of Government establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government officers and employees on the discharge of their official duties; reports, books, studies, surveys or similar documents; collections of data containing information pertaining to individuals that, if disclosed, would violate the right of privacy or publicity of the individuals to whom the information relates; or investigative reports.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection and in 227.7107-2, use the clause at 252.227-7022, Government Rights (Unlimited), in solicitations and contracts for architect-engineer services and for construction involving architect-engineer services.
              (b) When the purpose of a contract for architect-engineer services, or for construction involving architect-engineer services, is to obtain a unique architectural design of a building, a monument, or construction of similar nature, which for artistic, aesthetic or other special reasons the Government does not want duplicated, the Government may acquire exclusive control of the data pertaining to the design by including the clause at 252.227-7023, Drawings and Other Data to Become Property of Government, in solicitations and contracts.
              (c) The Government shall obtain unlimited rights in shop drawings for construction. In solicitations and contracts calling for delivery of shop drawings, include the clause at 252.227-7033, Rights in Shop Drawings.
            
            
              227.7107-2
              Contracts for construction supplies and research and development work.
              Use the provisions and clauses required by 227-7103-6 and 227.7203-6 when the acquisition is limited to—
              (a) Construction supplies or materials;
              (b) Experimental, developmental, or research work, or test and evaluation studies of structures, equipment, processes, or materials for use in construction; or
              (c) Both.
            
            
              227.7107-3
              Approval of restricted designs.
              The clause at 252.227-7024, Notice and Approval of Restricted Designs, may be included in architect-engineer contracts to permit the Government to make informed decisions concerning noncompetitive aspects of the design.
            
            
              227.7108
              Contractor data repositories.
              (a) Contractor data repositories may be established when permitted by agency procedures. The contractual instrument establishing the data repository must require, as a minimum, the data repository management contractor to—

              (1) Establish and maintain adequate procedures for protecting technical data delivered to or stored at the repository from unauthorized release or disclosure;
              
              (2) Establish and maintain adequate procedures for controlling the release or disclosure of technical data from the repository to third parties consistent with the Government's rights in such data;
              (3) When required by the contracting officer, deliver data to the Government on paper or in other specified media;
              (4) Be responsible for maintaining the currency of data delivered directly by Government contractors or subcontractors to the repository;
              (5) Obtain use and non-disclosure agreements (see 227.7103-7) from all persons to whom government purpose rights data is released or disclosed; and
              (6) Indemnify the Government from any liability to data owners or licensors resulting from, or as a consequence of, a release or disclosure of technical data made by the data repository contractor or its officers, employees, agents, or representatives.
              (b) If the contractor is or will be the data repository manager, the contractor's data management and distribution responsibilities must be identified in the contract or the contract must reference the agreement between the Government and the contractor that establishes those responsibilities.
              (c) If the contractor is not and will not be the data repository manager, do not require a contractor or subcontractor to deliver technical data marked with limited rights legends to a data repository managed by another contractor unless the contractor or subcontractor who has asserted limited rights agrees to release the data to the repository or has authorized, in writing, the Government to do so.
              (d) Repository procedures may provide for the acceptance, delivery, and subsequent distribution of technical data in storage media other than paper, including direct electronic exchange of data between two computers. The procedures must provide for the identification of any portions of the data provided with restrictive legends, when appropriate. The acceptance criteria must be consistent with the authorized delivery format.

              227.7202-2
              [Reserved]
            
            
              227.7202-3
              Rights in commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation.
              (a) The Government shall have only the rights specified in the license under which the commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation was obtained.
              (b) If the Government has a need for rights not conveyed under the license customarily provided to the public, the Government must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. The specific rights granted to the Government shall be enumerated in the contract license agreement or an addendum thereto.
            
            
              227.7202-4
              Contract clause.
              A specific contract clause governing the Government's rights in commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation is not prescribed. As required by 227.7202-3, the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation shall be identified in a license agreement.
            
            
              227.7203
              Noncommercial computer software and noncommercial computer software documentation.
            
            
              227.7203-1
              Policy.
              (a) DoD policy is to acquire only the computer software and computer software documentation, and the rights in such software or documentation, necessary to satisfy agency needs.
              (b) Solicitations and contracts shall—
              (1) Specify the computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under a contract and the delivery schedules for the software or documentation;
              (2) Establish or reference procedures for determining the acceptability of computer software or computer software documentation;
              (3) Establish separate contract line items, to the extent practicable, for the computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under a contract and require offerors and contractors to price separately each deliverable data item; and
              (4) Require offerors to identify, to the extent practicable, computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictions on the Government's rights and require contractors to identify computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered with such restrictions prior to delivery.
              (c) Offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in computer software developed exclusively at private expense except for the software identified at 227.7203-5(a) (3) through (6).

              (d) Offerors and contractors shall not be prohibited or discouraged from furnishing or offering to furnish computer software developed exclusively at private expense solely because the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose the software may be restricted.
              (e) For acquisitions involving major weapon systems or subsystems of major weapon systems, the acquisition plan shall address acquisition strategies that provide for computer software and computer software documentation, and the associated license rights, in accordance with 207.106(S-70).
              [60 FR 33471, June 28, 1995, as amended at 72 FR 51189, Sept. 6, 2007]
            
            
              227.7203-2
              Acquisition of noncommercial computer software and computer software documentation.
              (a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and requirements personnel to assure that computer software and computer software documentation requirements included in solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7203-1.
              (b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the Government's minimum needs. In addition to desired software performance, compatibility, or other technical considerations, needs determinations should consider such factors as multiple site or shared use requirements, whether the Government's software maintenance philosophy will require the right to modify or have third parties modify the software, and any special computer software documentation requirements.
              (2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for computer software or computer software documentation, data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's needs with prices offered.
              (c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts—
              (1) Identify the types of computer software and the quantity of computer programs and computer software documentation to be delivered, any requirements for multiple users at one site or multiple site licenses, and the format and media in which the software or documentation will be delivered;
              (2) Establish each type of computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by an exhibit to the contract);
              (3) Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable item of computer software or computer software documentation under a fixed-price type contract;
              (4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable item; and
              (5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item.
            
            
              227.7203-3
              Early identification of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction or disclosure.
              (a) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitation that include the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any computer software or computer software documentation for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertion to the offer.
              (b) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014 permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to make additional assertions of restrictions. The prescriptions for the use of that clause and its alternates are at 227.7203-6(a).
            
            
              227.7203-4
              License rights.
              (a) Grant of license. The Government obtains rights in computer software or computer software documentation, including a copyright license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the contractor which developed the software or documentation or the licensor of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not the licensor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a computer software license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the software. Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software developed exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.7203-5 (b) and (c)). They may not, without the Government's agreement (see 227.7203-5(d)), restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed exclusively with Government funds or in computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract.
              (b) Source of funds determination. The determination of the source of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest practicable segregable portion of the software or documentation (e.g., a software sub-routine that performs a specific function). Contractors may assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software which otherwise qualifies for restricted rights under the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.
            
            
              227.7203-5
              Government rights.
              The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.
              (a) Unlimited rights. The Government obtains an unlimited rights license in—
              (1) Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;
              (2) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a Government contract;
              (3) Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the contractor by the Government;
              (4) Computer software or computer software documentation that is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or it assets to another party;
              (5) Computer software or computer software documentation obtained with unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or
              (6) Computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract with—
              (i) Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in technical data, or government purpose license rights and the restrictive conditions have expired; or
              (ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such software or documentation for commercial purposes has expired.
              (b) Government purpose rights. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Government obtains government purpose rights in computer software developed with mixed funding.

              (2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7014 provides a nominal five-year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the software without consideration from either party. Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to commercialize the software or, for software developed by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' interests in the software.
              (3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the computer software. Upon expiration of the government purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the software including the right to authorize others to use data for commercial purposes.
              (4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or disclose, or authorize others to release or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights to any person unless—
              (i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or
              (ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
              (5) When computer software marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025, the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.
              (6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that computer software or computer software documentation marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights software or documentation. Documents transmitting government purpose rights software or documentation to persons under class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such software or documentation are provided.
              (c) Restricted rights. (1) The Government obtains restricted rights in noncommercial computer software, required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Government under a contract, that was developed exclusively at private expense.
              (2) Contractors are not required to provide the Government additional rights in computer software delivered or otherwise provided to the Government with restricted rights. When the Government has a need for additional rights, the Government must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. List or describe all software in which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license agreement made part of the contract (see paragraph (d) of this subsection). The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights granted to the Government.
              (d) Specifically negotiated license rights. Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in computer software in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer software, consider the planned software maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement. If negotiating to relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider the administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject to restrictions from unauthorized release or disclosure. The negotiated license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software or documentation and the extent to which the Government may authorize others to do so. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.
              (e) Rights in derivative computer software or computer software documentation. The clause at 252.227-7014 protects the Government's rights in computer software, computer software documentation, or portions thereof that the contractor subsequently uses to prepare derivative software or subsequently embeds or includes in other software or documentation. The Government retains the rights it obtained under the development contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative software or documentation.

              227.7203-6
              Contract clauses.
              (a)(1) Use the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, in solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver computer software or computer software documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are technical data (other than computer software documentation), commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation, commercial items (see 227.7102-3), special works (see 227.7205), or contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research Program (see 227.7104), Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do not use the clause in architect-engineer and construction contracts.
              (2) Use the clause at 252.227-7014 with its Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—
              (i) In the interest of the Government; and
              (ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of the Government.
              (b) Use the clause at 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014.
              (c) Use the clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014. The clause provides procedures for the validation of asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software.
              (d) Use the provision at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014), for performance of its contract, computer software or computer software documentation marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s).
              (e) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer software or computer software documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in the solicitation as deliverable items that are the same or substantially the same as software or documentation which the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.

              (f) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014 when the contractor will be required to deliver noncommercial computer software documentation (technical data). The clause implements statutory requirements under 10 U.S.C. 2321. Paragraph (e) of the clause contains information that must be included in a formal challenge.

              227.7203-8
              Deferred delivery and deferred ordering of computer software and computer software documentation.
              (a) Deferred delivery. Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the Government's interests to defer the delivery of computer software or computer software documentation. The clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of data identified as “deferred delivery” data or computer software at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or computer software documentation that is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such software or documentation to permit timely delivery.
              (b) Deferred ordering. Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement for software or documentation has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for computer software or computer software documentation. Under this clause the contracting officer may order any computer software or computer software documentation generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such technical data or computer software expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the software or documentation are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the software or documentation into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.
            
            
              227.7203-9
              Copyright.
              (a) Copyright license. (1) The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, requires a contractor to grant, or obtain for the Government license rights which permit the Government to reproduce the software or documentation, distribute copies, perform or display the software or documentation and, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in computer software or computer software documentation will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate copyright licenses for computer software that provide less rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software license. For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights in technical data license.

              (2) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted software into a deliverable software item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted software in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.
              (b) Copyright considerations—special works. See 227.7205 for copyright considerations when acquiring special works.
            
            
              227.7203-10
              Contractor identification and marking of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictive markings.
              (a) Identification requirements. (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify, prior to contract award, any computer software or computer software documentation that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306(a). An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.
              (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13.
              (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the computer software or computer software documentation, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, permits a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.
              (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7203-13, the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.
              (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose computer software or computer software documentation.
              (b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation—
              (1) Requires a contractor who desires to restrict the Government's rights in computer software or computer software documentation to place restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is anticipated that the software will or may be used in combat or situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors to insert instructions into computer programs that interfere with or delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend or other license notice; and

              (2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any computer software or computer software documentation in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in that software or documentation unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, produce, release, or disclose the software or documentation have expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the software or documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend.
              (c) Unmarked computer software or computer software documentation. (1) Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the software or documentation pending evaluation of the request.
              (2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked computer software or computer software documentation at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer within six months following the furnishing or delivery of such software or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must—
              (i) Identify the software or documentation that should have been marked;
              (ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of computer software or computer software documentation contained in the clause at 252.227-7014; and
              (iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the software or documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.
              (3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the software or documentation were not distributed outside the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.
              [60 FR 33482, June 28, 1995, as amended at 63 FR 55052, Oct. 14, 1998]
            
            
              227.7203-11
              Contractor procedures and records.
              (a) The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity of restrictive markings.
              (b) The clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, requires contractors and their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of markings that assert restrictions on the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of computer software.
            
            
              227.7203-12
              Government right to establish conformity of markings.
              (a) Nonconforming markings. (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227-7014 is also a nonconforming marking.

              (2) The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is not subject to 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and the correction of nonconforming markings on computer software documentation (technical data) is not subject to 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer software or computer software documentation bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the software or documentation to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected software or documentation within 60 days following the person's receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at the person's expense. When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer software documentation for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.
              (b) Unjustified markings. (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer software documentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on computer software developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.
              (2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either—
              (i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or
              (ii) Return the computer software or computer software documentation to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the software or documentation are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software or documentation to the contracting officer within 60 days following receipt of the software or documentation, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.
            
            
              227.7203-13
              Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.
              (a) General. An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government may require an offeror or contractor to submit sufficient information to permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to believe that an assertion is not valid.
              (b) Requests for information. Contracting officers should have a reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct prior to requesting information. When requesting information, provide the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that an asserted restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for requesting information concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.7203-5(d) when additional license rights are needed but there is no basis to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be valid.
              (c) Transacting matters directly with subcontractors. The clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—
              
              (1) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor.
              (2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or
              (3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.
              (d) Challenging asserted restrictions—(1) Pre-award considerations. The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227-7019 could significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.
              (2) Computer software documentation. Computer software documentation is technical data. Challenges to asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software documentation must be made in accordance with the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, and the guidance at 227.7103-13. The procedures in the clause at 252.227-7037 implement requirements contained in 10 U.S.C. 2321. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7103-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged.
              (3) Computer software. (i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract. The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires three years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's challenge rights do not apply to software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions.
              (ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction. Before challenging an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the asserted restrictions. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7203-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged. After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.
              (iii) Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting documentation was requested. Challenges must be in writing and issued to the person asserting the restriction.
              (4) Extension of response time. The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
              (e) Validating or denying asserted restrictions. (1) Contracting officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the validity of each challenged assertion unless the parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. See 252.227-7019(g) for restrictions applicable following a determination of urgent and compelling circumstances.

              (2) Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.
              (f) Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction. When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.

              Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of computer software and computer software documentation.
              (a) Computer software documentation. Computer software documentation is technical data. See 227.7103-14 for appropriate guidance and statutory requirements.
              (b) Computer software—(1) Conformity and acceptance. Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of computer software shall specify the requirements the software must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether computer software tendered for acceptance conforms to the contractual requirements. Except for nonconforming restrictive markings (follow the procedures at 227.7203-12(a) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason computer software tendered for acceptance fails to conform to contractual requirements), do not accept software that does not conform in all respects to applicable contractual requirements. Correction or replacement of nonconforming software, or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with—
              (i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; or
              (ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for nonconforming deliverables.
              (2) Warranties—(i) Weapon systems. Computer software that is a component of a weapon system or major subsystem should be warranted as part of the weapon system warranty. Follow the procedures at 246.7.
              (ii) Non-weapon systems. Approval of the chief of the contracting office must be obtained to use a computer software warranty other than a weapon system warranty. Consider the factors at FAR 46.703 in deciding whether to obtain a computer software warranty. When approval for a warranty has been obtained, the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, and its alternates, may be appropriately modified for use with computer software or a procurement specific clause may be developed.

              Subcontractor rights in computer software or computer software documentation.
              (a) Subcontractors and suppliers at all tiers should be provided the same protection for their rights in computer software or computer software documentation as are provided to prime contractors.

              (b) The clauses at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, obtain a contractor's agreement that the Government's transaction of validation or challenge matters directly with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercises its right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7203-13(c) for computer software and 227.7103-13(c)(3) for computer software documentation (technical data).
              
              (c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers who will be furnishing computer software in response to a Government requirement (see 227.7103-15(c) for clauses required when subcontractors or suppliers will be furnishing computer software documentation (technical data)):
              (1) 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation;
              (2) 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software;

              (4) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government.
              (d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government under the provisions of the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause contained in the contractor's contract with the Government.

              Computer software or computer software documentation may be released or disclosed to foreign governments, foreign contractors, or international organizations only if release or disclosure is otherwise permitted both by Federal export controls and other national security laws or regulations. Subject to such laws and regulations, the Department of Defense—
              (a) May release or disclose computer software or computer software documentation in which it has obtained unlimited rights to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities; and
              (b) Shall not release or disclose computer software or computer software documentation for which restrictions on use, release, or disclosure have been asserted to such foreign entities or authorize the use of such data by those entities, unless the intended recipient is subject to the same provisions as included in the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 and the requirements of the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, governing use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such data have been satisfied.

              (a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see paragraph (c) of this subsection) in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, when the Government requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose all computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for special works.

              (b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain rights to the computer software or computer software documentation that are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under the software rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.
              
              (c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate software rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.

              Contracts for special works.
              (a) Use the clause at 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works, in solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to control the distribution of computer software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated in the performance of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such software or documentation. Use the clause—
              (1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, when the Government must own or control copyright in all computer software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract; or
              (2) In addition to the clause at 252.227-7014 when the Government must own or control copyright in some of the computer software or computer software documentation first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract. The specific software or documentation in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in a special contract requirement.
              (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in the computer software or computer software documentation delivered as a special work under the clause at 252.227-7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that software or documentation. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.
              (c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any work copyrighted by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, to perform or display any portion of that work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable work.
              (d) Examples of other works which may be procured under the clause at 252.227-7020 include, but are not limited to, audiovisual works, scripts, soundtracks, musical compositions, and adaptations; histories of departments, agencies, services or units thereof; surveys of Government establishments; instructional works or guidance to Government officers and employees on the discharge of their official duties; reports, books, studies, surveys or similar documents; collections of data containing information pertaining to individuals that, if disclosed, would violate the right of privacy or publicity of the individuals to whom the information relates; or investigative reports.

              The requirement for performance and payment bonds is waived for cost-reimbursement contracts. However, for cost-type contracts with fixed-price construction subcontracts over $35,000, require the prime contractor to obtain from each of its construction subcontractors performance and payment protections in favor of the prime contractor as follows:
              (1) For fixed-price construction subcontracts over $35,000, but not exceeding $150,000, payment protection sufficient to pay labor and material costs, using any of the alternatives listed at FAR 28.102-1(b)(1).
              (2) For fixed-price construction subcontracts over $150,000—
              (i) A payment bond sufficient to pay labor and material costs; and
              (ii) A performance bond in an equal amount if available at no additional cost.

              For Defense Environmental Restoration Program construction contracts entered into pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2701—
              (a) Any rights of action under the performance bond shall only accrue to, and be for the exclusive use of, the obligee named in the bond;
              (b) In the event of default, the surety's liability on the performance bond is limited to the cost of completion of the contract work, less the balance of unexpended funds. Under no circumstances shall the liability exceed the penal sum of the bond;
              (c) The surety shall not be liable for indemnification or compensation of the obligee for loss or liability arising from personal injury or property damage, even if the injury or damage was caused by a breach of the bonded contract; and
              (d) Once it has taken action to meet its obligations under the bond, the surety is entitled to any indemnification and identical standard of liability to which the contractor was entitled under the contract or applicable laws and regulations.

              (2) The investigative and claims services of a surety company are desired.

              DoD has established the National Defense Projects Rating Plan, also known as the Special Casualty Insurance Rating Plan, as a risk-pooling arrangement to minimize the cost to the Government of purchasing the liability insurance listed in FAR 28.307-2.

              (2) The head of the contracting activity decides not to allow the contractor to buy insurance for war-hazard losses.
              (b)(1) Use the clause at 252.228-7001, Ground and Flight Risk, in all solicitations and contracts for the acquisition, development, production, modification, maintenance, repair, flight, or overhaul of aircraft, except those solicitations and contracts—

              (i) That are strictly for activities incidental to the normal operations of the aircraft (e.g., refueling operations, minor non-structural actions not requiring towing such as replacing aircraft tires due to wear and tear);
              (ii) That are awarded under FAR Part 12 procedures and are for the development, production, modification, maintenance, repair, flight, or overhaul of aircraft; or otherwise involving the furnishing of aircraft;
              (iii) For which a non-DoD customer (including a foreign military sales customer) has not agreed to assume the risk for loss or destruction of, or damages to, the aircraft; or

              (iv) For commercial derivative aircraft that are to be maintained to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness when the work will be performed at a licensed FAA repair station.
              
              (2) The clause at 252.228-7001 may be modified only as follows:

              (i) Include a modified definition of “aircraft” if the contract covers other than conventional types of winged aircraft, i.e., helicopters, vertical take-off or landing aircraft, lighter-than-air airships, unmanned aerial vehicles, or other nonconventional aircraft. The modified definition should describe a stage of manufacture comparable to the standard definition.
              (ii) Modify “in the open” to include “hush houses,” test hangars and comparable structures, and other designated areas.
              (iii) Expressly define the “contractor's premises” where the aircraft will be located during and for contract performance. These locations may include contract premises which are owned or leased by the contractor or subcontractor, or premises where the contractor or subcontractor is a permittee or licensee or has a right to use, including Government airfields.
              (iv) Revise paragraph (e)(3) of the clause to provide Government assumption of risk for transportation by conveyance on streets or highways when transportation is—
              (A) Limited to the vicinity of contractor premises; and
              (B) Incidental to work performed under the contract.
              (3) Follow the procedures at PGI 228.370(b) when using the clause at 252.228-7001.

              (c) The clause at 252.228-7003, Capture and Detention, may be used when contractor employees are subject to capture and detention and may not be covered by the War Hazards Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).
              (d) The clause at 252.228-7005, Accident Reporting and Investigation Involving Aircraft, Missiles, and Space Launch Vehicles, may be used in solicitations and contracts which involve the manufacture, modification, overhaul, or repair of these items.
              (e) Use the clause at 252.228-7006, Compliance with Spanish Laws and Insurance, in solicitations and contracts for services or construction to be performed in Spain, unless the contractor is a Spanish concern.

              (a) By law, bilateral agreements with foreign governments must include a provision that commodities acquired under contracts funded by U.S. assistance programs shall be exempt from taxation by the foreign government. If taxes or customs duties nevertheless are imposed, the foreign government must reimburse the amount of such taxes to the U.S. Government (Section 579 of Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2003 (Pub. L. 108-7), as amended by Section 506 of Division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (Pub. L. 108-199), and similar sections in subsequent acts).
              (b) This foreign tax exemption—
              (1) Applies to a contract or subcontract for commodities when—
              (i) The funds are appropriated by the annual foreign operations appropriations act; and
              (ii) The value of the contract or subcontract is $500 or more;
              (2) Does not apply to the acquisition of services;
              (3) Generally is implemented through letters of offer and acceptance, other country-to-country agreements, or Federal interagency agreements; and
              (4) Requires reporting of noncompliance for effective implementation.

              (a) Definitions. As used in this subsection—
              (i) Covered contract means a DoD prime contract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price contract without cost incentives. The term also includes a subcontract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price subcontract without cost incentives under such a prime contract.
              (ii) Covered segment means a product division of the contractor that allocated more than $1,100,000 in independent research and development and bid and proposal (IR&D/B&P) costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. In the case of a contractor that has no product divisions, the term means that contractor as a whole. A product division of the contractor that allocated less than $1,100,000 in IR&D/B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
              (iii) Major contractor means any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11,000,000 in IR&D/B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. For purposes of calculating the dollar threshold amounts to determine whether a contractor meets the definition of “major contractor,” do not include contractor segments allocating less than $1,100,000 of IR&D/B&P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.
              (c) Allowability. (i) Departments/agencies shall not supplement this regulation in any way that limits IR&D/B&P cost allowability.
              (ii) See 225.7303-2(c) for allowability provisions affecting foreign military sale contracts.
              (iii) For major contractors, the following limitations apply:
              (A) The amount of IR&D/B&P costs allowable under DoD contracts shall not exceed the lesser of—
              (1) Such contracts' allocable share of total incurred IR&D/B&O costs; or
              (2) The amount of incurred IR&D/B&P costs for projects having potential interest to DoD.
              (B) Allowable IR&D/B&P costs are limited to those for projects that are of potential interest to DoD, including activities intended to accomplish any of the following:
              (1) Enable superior performance of future U.S. weapon systems and components.
              (2) Reduce acquisition costs and life-cycle costs of military systems.
              (3) Strengthen the defense industrial and technology base of the United States.
              (4) Enhance the industrial competitiveness of the United States.
              (5) Promote the development of technologies identified as critical under 10 U.S.C. 2522.
              (6) Increase the development and promotion of efficient and effective applications of dual-use technologies.
              
              (7) Provide efficient and effective technologies for achieving such environmental benefits as: Improved environmental data gathering, environmental cleanup and restoration, pollution reduction in manufacturing, environmental conservation, and environmentally safe management of facilities.
              (C) For annual IR&D costs to be allowable—
              (1) The IR&D projects generating the costs must be reported to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) using the DTIC's online input form and instructions at http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/;
              
              (2) The inputs must be updated at least annually and when the project is completed; and
              (3) Copies of the input and updates must be made available for review by the cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) and the cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency auditor to support the allowability of the costs.
              (iv) Contractors not meeting the threshold of a major contractor are encouraged to use the DTIC online input form to report IR&D projects to provide DoD with visibility into the technical content of the contractors' IR&D activities.
              (v) For major contractors, the ACO or corporate ACO shall—
              (A) Determine whether IR&D/B&P projects are of potential interest to DoD; and
              (B) Provide the results of the determination to the contractor.
              (vi) The cognizant contract administration office shall furnish contractors with guidance on financial information needed to support IR&D/B&P costs and on technical information needed from major contractors to support the potential interest to DoD determination (also see 242.771-3).

              External restructuring costs.
              (a) Scope. This subsection—
              (1) Prescribes policies and procedures for allowing contractor external restructuring costs when savings would result for DoD; and
              (2) Implements 10 U.S.C. 2325.
              (b) Definitions. As used in this subsection:
              (1) Business combination means a transaction whereby assets or operations of two or more companies not previously under common ownership or control are combined, whether by merger, acquisition, or sale/purchase of assets.
              (2) External restructuring activities means restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of companies not previously under common ownership or control. They do not include restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of only one of the companies not previously under common ownership or control, or, when there has been no business combination, restructuring activities undertaken within one company. External restructuring activities are a direct outgrowth of a business combination. They normally will be initiated within 3 years of the business combination.
              (3) Restructuring activities means nonroutine, nonrecurring, or extraordinary activities to combine facilities, operations, or workforce, in order to eliminate redundant capabilities, improve future operations, and reduce overall costs. Restructuring activities do not include routine or ongoing repositionings and redeployments of a contractor's productive facilities or workforce (e.g., normal plant rearrangement or employee relocation), nor do they include other routine or ordinary activities charged as indirect costs that would otherwise have been incurred (e.g., planning and analysis, contract administration and oversight, or recurring financial and administrative support).
              (4) Restructuring costs means the costs, including both direct and indirect, of restructuring activities. Restructuring costs that may be allowed include, but are not limited to, severance pay for employees, early retirement incentive payments for employees, employee retraining costs, relocation expense for retained employees, and relocation and rearrangement of plant and equipment. For purposes of this definition, if restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities allocated to DoD contracts are less than $2.5 million, the costs shall not be subject to the audit, review, and determination requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this subsection; instead, the normal rules for determining cost allowability in accordance with FAR part 31 shall apply.
              (5) Restructuring savings means cost reductions, including both direct and indirect cost reductions, that result from restructuring activities. Reassignments of cost to future periods are not restructuring savings.
              (c) Limitations on cost allowability. Restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities shall not be allowed unless—
              (1) Such costs are allowable in accordance with FAR part 31 and DFARS part 231;
              (2) An audit of projected restructuring costs and restructuring savings is performed;
              (3) The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) reviews the audit report and the projected costs and projected savings, and negotiates an advance agreement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection; and
              (4)(i) The official designated in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this subsection determines in writing that the audited projected savings, on a present value basis, for DoD resulting from the restructuring will exceed either—
              (A) The costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one; or
              (B) The costs allowed, and the business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD.
              (ii)(A) If the amount of restructuring costs is expected to exceed $25 million over a 5-year period, the designated official is the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) or the Principal Deputy. This authority may not be delegated below the level of an Assistant Secretary of Defense.
              (B) For all other cases, the designated official is the Director of the Defense Contract Management Agency. The Director may not delegate this authority.
              (d) Procedures and ACO responsibilities. As soon as it is known that the contractor will incur restructuring costs for external restructuring activities, the cognizant ACO shall follow the procedures at PGI 231.205-70(d).
              (e) Information needed to obtain a determination. (1) The novation agreement (if one is required).
              (2) The contractor's restructuring proposal.
              (3) The proposed advance agreement.
              (4) The audit report.
              (5) Any other pertinent information.
              (6) The cognizant ACO's recommendation for a determination. This recommendation must clearly indicate one of the following, consistent with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this subsection:
              (i) The audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one on a present value basis.
              (ii) The business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD, and the audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed on a present value basis.
              (f) Contracting officer responsibilities. (1) The contracting officer, in consultation with the cognizant ACO, should consider including a repricing clause in noncompetitive fixed-price contracts that are negotiated during the period between—
              (i) The time a business combination is announced; and
              (ii) The time the contractor's forward pricing rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of restructuring.
              (2) The decision to use a repricing clause will depend upon the particular circumstances involved, including—
              (i) When the restructuring will take place;
              (ii) When restructuring savings will begin to be realized;
              (iii) The contract performance period;
              (iv) Whether the contracting parties are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of restructuring on the contract; and
              (v) The size of the potential dollar impact of restructuring on the contract.
              (3) If the contracting officer decides to use a repricing clause, the clause must provide for a downward-only price adjustment to ensure that DoD receives its appropriate share of restructuring net savings.

              Requirements.

              (1) Pursuant to section 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160), no limitation may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work under DoD contracts. The 26 percent limitation imposed on administrative indirect costs by OMB Circular No. A-21 shall not be applied to DoD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993, to institutions of higher education because the same limitation is not applied to other organizations performing similar work.
              
              (2) The cognizant administrative contracting officer may waive the prohibition in 231.303(1) if the governing body of the institution of higher education requests the waiver to simplify the institution's overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.
              (3) Under 10 U.S.C. 2249, the costs cited in 231.205-22(a) are unallowable.

            Contract financing payments.
            (a) DoD policy is to make contract financing payments as quickly as possible. Generally, the contracting officer shall insert the standard due dates of 7 days for progress payments, and 14 days for performance-based payments and interim payments on cost-type contracts, in the appropriate paragraphs of the respective payment clauses. For interim payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for services, see 232.906(a)(i).
            (b) The contracting officer should coordinate contract financing payment terms with offices that will be involved in the payment process to ensure that specified terms can be met. Where justified, the contracting officer may insert a due date greater than, but not less than, the standard. In determining payment terms, consider—
            (i) Geographical separation;
            (ii) Workload;
            (iii) Contractor ability to submit a proper request; and
            (iv) Other factors that could affect timing of payment.

Agency discretion under FAR part 32 is at the DoD level and is not delegated to the departments and agencies. Proposals by the departments and agencies, to exercise agency discretion, shall be submitted to OUSD(AT&L)DPAP.

            Required financial reviews.
            The contracting officer shall perform a financial review when the contracting officer does not otherwise have sufficient information to make a positive determination of financial responsibility. In addition, the contracting officer shall consider performing a financial review—
            (a) Prior to award of a contract, when—
            (1) The contractor is on a list requiring preaward clearance or other special clearance before award;
            (2) The contractor is listed on the Consolidated List of Contractors Indebted to the Government (Hold-Up List), or is otherwise known to be indebted to the Government;
            (3) The contractor may receive Government assets such as contract financing payments or Government property;
            (4) The contractor is experiencing performance difficulties on other work; or
            (5) The contractor is a new company or a new supplier of the item.
            (b) At periodic intervals after award of a contract, when—
            (1) Any of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this subsection are applicable; or
            (2) There is any other reason to question the contractor's ability to finance performance and completion of the contract.

            Appropriate information.
            (a) The contracting officer shall obtain the type and depth of financial and other information that is required to establish a contractor's financial capability or disclose a contractor's financial condition. While the contracting officer should not request information that is not necessary for protection for the Government's interests, the contracting officer must insist upon obtaining the information that is necessary. The unwillingness or inability of a contractor to present reasonably requested information in a timely manner, especially information that a prudent business person would be expected to have and to use in the professional management of a business, may be a material fact in the determination of the contractor's responsibility and prospects for contract completion.
            (b) The contracting officer shall obtain the following information to the extent required to protect the Government's interest. In addition, if the contracting officer concludes that information not listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this subsection is required to comply with 232.072-1, that information should be requested. The information must be for the person(s) who are legally liable for contract performance. If the contractor is not a corporation, the contracting officer shall obtain the required information for each individual/joint venturer/partner:
            (1) Balance sheet and income statement—
            (i) For the current fiscal year (interim);
            
            (ii) For the most recent fiscal year and, preferably, for the 2 preceding fiscal years. These should be certified by an independent public accountant or by an appropriate officer of the firm; and
            (iii) Forecasted for each fiscal year for the remainder of the period of contract performance.
            (2) Summary history of the contractor and its principal managers, disclosing any previous insolvencies—corporate or personal, and describing its products or services.
            (3) Statement of all affiliations disclosing—
            (i) Material financial interests of the contractor;
            (ii) Material financial interests in the contractor;
            (iii) Material affiliations of owners, officers, directors, major stockholders; and
            (iv) The major stockholders if the contractor is not a widely-traded, publicly-held corporation.
            (4) Statement of all forms of compensation to each officer, manager, partner, joint venturer, or proprietor, as appropriate—
            (i) Planned for the current year;
            (ii) Paid during the past 2 years; and
            (iii) Deferred to future periods.
            (5) Business base and forecast that—
            (i) Shows, by significant markets, existing contracts and outstanding offers, including those under negotiation; and
            (ii) Is reconcilable to indirect cost rate projections.
            (6) Cash forecast for the duration of the contract (see 232.072-3).
            (7) Financing arrangement information that discloses—
            (i) Availability of cash to finance contract performance;
            (ii) Contractor's exposure to financial crisis from creditor's demands;
            (iii) Degree to which credit security provisions could conflict with Government title terms under contract financing;
            (iv) Clearly stated confirmations of credit with no unacceptable qualifications;
            (v) Unambiguous written agreement by a creditor if credit arrangements include deferred trade payments or creditor subordinations/repayment suspensions.
            (8) Statement of all state, local, and Federal tax accounts, including special mandatory contributions, e.g., environmental superfund.
            (9) Description and explanation of the financial effect of issues such as—
            (i) Leases, deferred purchase arrangements, or patent or royalty arrangements;
            (ii) Insurance, when relevant to the contract;
            (iii) Contemplated capital expenditures, changes in equity, or contractor debt load;
            (iv) Pending claims either by or against the contractor;
            (v) Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, litigation, environmental, or product liabilities;
            (vi) Validity of accounts receivable and actual value of inventory, as assets; and
            (vii) Status and aging of accounts payable.
            (10) Significant ratios such as—
            (i) Inventory to annual sales;
            (ii) Inventory to current assets;
            (iii) Liquid assets to current assets;
            (iv) Liquid assets to current liabilities;
            (v) Current assets to current liabilities; and
            (vi) Net worth to net debt.

            232.072-3
            Cash flow forecasts.
            (a) A contractor must be able to sustain a sufficient cash flow to perform the contract. When there is doubt regarding the sufficiency of a contractor's cash flow, the contracting officer should require the contractor to submit a cash flow forecast covering the duration of the contract.
            (b) A contractor's inability of refusal to prepare and provide cash flow forecasts or to reconcile actual cash flow with previous forecasts is a strong indicator of serious managerial deficiencies or potential contract cost or performance problems.

            (c) Single or one-time cash flow forecasts are of limited forecasting power. As such, they should be limited to preaward survey situations. Reliability of cash flow forecasts can be established only by comparing a series of previous actual cash flows with the corresponding forecasts and examining the causes of any differences.
            (d) Cash flow forecasts must—
            (1) Show the origin and use of all material amounts of cash within the entire business unit responsible for contract performance, period by period, for the length of the contract (or until the risk of a cash crisis ends); and
            (2) Provide an audit trail to the data and assumptions used to prepare it.
            (e) Cash flow forecasts can be no more reliable than the assumptions on which they are based. Most important of these assumptions are—
            (1) Estimated amounts and timing of purchases and payments for materials, parts, components, subassemblies, and services;
            (2) Estimated amounts and timing of payments of purchase or production of capital assets, test facilities, and tooling;
            (3) Amounts and timing of fixed cash charges such as debt installments, interest, rentals, taxes, and indirect costs;
            (4) Estimated amounts and timing of payments for projected labor, both direct and indirect;
            (5) Reasonableness of projected manufacturing and production schedules;
            (6) Estimated amounts and timing of billings to customers (including progress payments), and customer payments;
            (7) Estimated amounts and timing of cash receipts from lenders or other credit sources, and liquidation of loans; and
            (8) Estimated amount and timing of cash receipt from other sources.
            (f) The contracting officer should review the assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts. In determining whether the assumptions are reasonable and realistic, the contracting officer should consult with—
            (1) The contractor;
            (2) Government personnel in the areas of finance, engineering, production, cost, and price analysis; or
            (3) Prospective supply, subcontract, and loan or credit sources.

              (e)(2) Progress payments based on percentage or stage of completion are authorized only for contracts for construction (as defined in FAR 36.102), shipbuilding, and ship conversion, alteration, or repair. However, percentage or state of completion methods of measuring contractor performance may be used for performance-based payments in accordance with FAR Subpart 32.10.

              Provisional delivery payments.
              (a) The contracting officer may establish provisional delivery payments to pay contractors for the costs of supplies and services delivered to and accepted by the Government under the following contract actions if undefinitized:
              (1) Letter contracts contemplating a fixed-price contract.
              (2) Orders under basic ordering agreements.
              (3) Spares provisioning documents annexed to contracts.
              (4) Unpriced equitable adjustments on fixed-price contracts.
              (5) Orders under indefinite-delivery contracts.
              (b) Provisional delivery payments shall be—
              (1) Used sparingly;
              (2) Priced conservatively; and
              (3) Reduced by liquidating previous progress payments in accordance with the Progress Payments clause.
              (c) Provisional delivery payments shall not—
              (1) Include profit;
              (2) Exceed funds obligated for the undefinitized contract action; or
              (3) Influence the definitized contract price.

              For fixed-price contracts with a period of performance in excess of a year that meet the dollar thresholds established in FAR 32.104(d), and for solicitations expected to result in such contracts, in lieu of the requirement at FAR 32.104(d)(1)(ii) for the contractor to demonstrate actual financial need or the unavailability of private financing, DoD has determined that—
              (1) The use of customary contract financing (see FAR 32.113), other than loan guarantees and advance payments, is in DoD's best interest; and
              (2) Further justification of its use in individual acquisitions is unnecessary.

It should be noted that an offeror's financial condition may be sufficient to make the contractor responsible for award purposes, but may not be adequate security for commercial contract financing.

              (i) Commercial advance payments: The contractor entitlement date specified in the contract, or 30 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.
              (ii) Commercial interim payments: The contractor entitlement date specified in the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later. The prompt payment standards for commercial delivery payments shall be the same as specified in FAR Subpart 32.9 for invoice payments for the item delivered.
              (g) Installment payment financing for commercial items. Installment payment financing shall not be used for DoD contracts, unless market research has established that this form of contract financing is both appropriate and customary in the commercial marketplace. When installment payment financing is used, the contracting officer shall use the ceiling percentage of contract price that is customary in the particular marketplace (not to exceed the maximum rate established in FAR 52.232-30).

              (1) Is a means of financing the performance of more than one contract held by a single contractor;
              (2) Is especially convenient for the financing of cost-type contracts with nonprofit educational or research institutions for experimental or research and development work when several contracts require financing by advance payments. When appropriate, pooled advance payments may also be used to finance other types of contracts held by a single contractor; and
              (3) May be established—
              (i) Without regard to the number of appropriations involved;
              (ii) To finance contracts for one or more department(s) or contracting activity(ies); or
              (iii) In addition to any other advance payment pool agreement at a single contractor location when it is more convenient or otherwise preferable to have more than one agreement.

              (ii) The contracting officer may request the contractor to prepare the supplementary analysis as an attachment to the progress payment request when the contracting officer determines that the contractor's methods of estimating the “Costs to Complete” are reliable, accurate, and not susceptible to improper influences.
              (iii) To maintain an audit trail and permit verification of calculations, do not make the loss ratio adjustments by altering or replacing data on the contractor's original request for progress payment (SF 1443, Contractor's Request for Progress Payment, or computer generated equivalent).

This determination was published in the Federal Register on June 11, 1996, as required by law. Nevertheless, if departments/agencies decide it is in the Government's interests, or if the contracting officer makes a determination in accordance with FAR 32.803(d) concerning a significantly indebted offeror, they may exclude the no-setoff commitment.

              Applicability.
              (1) Except for FAR 32.908, FAR subpart 32.9, Prompt Payment, does not apply when—
              (i) There is—
              (A) An emergency, as defined in the Disaster Relief Act of 1974;
              (B) A contingency operation (see FAR 2.101(b)); or
              (C) The release or threatened release of hazardous substances (as defined in 4 U.S.C. 9606, section 106); and
              (ii) The head of the contracting activity has made a determination, after consultation with the cognizant comptroller, that conditions exist that limit normal business operations; and

              (iii) Payments will be made in the operational area or made contingent upon receiving supporting documentation (i.e., contract, invoice, and receiving report) from the operational area.
              (2) Criteria limiting normal business operations during emergencies and contingency operations that restrict the use of FAR 32.9 may include such conditions as—
              (i) Support infrastructure, hardware, communications capabilities, and bandwidth are not consistently available such that normal business operations can be carried out;
              (ii) Support resources, facilities, and banking needs are not consistently available for use as necessary in carrying out normal business operations;
              (iii) Military mission priorities override the availability of appropriately skilled personnel in support of back-office operations;
              (iv) Mobility impairments and security concerns restrict free movement of personnel and documents necessary for timely processing;

              (v) Foreign vendors are not familiar with or do not understand DoD contract requirements (i.e., proper invoice, receiving documentation, and contracting terms); or
              (vi) Documents received in support of payment requests and shipments require language translations that cannot be performed and documented within normal business processing times.
              (3) Subsequent Determinations. The head of the contracting activity shall make subsequent determinations, after consultation with the cognizant comptroller, as the operational area evolves into either a more stable or less stable environment.
              (i) If the head of the contracting activity determines that the operational area has evolved into a more stable environment, the contracting officer shall notify, by issuance of a contract modification, each contractor performing in the operational area under review. The modification deactivates clause 252.232-7011 and activates the applicable FAR Prompt Payment clause in the contract.
              (ii) If after deactivation of clause 252.232-7011, the head of the contracting activity subsequently determines that the operational area has evolved into a less stable environment, the head of the contracting activity will make a determination that conditions exist that limit normal business operations. The contracting officer will then reactivate clause 252.232-7011 by issuance of a contract modification.

              Responsibilities.

              DoD policy is to assist small business concerns by paying them as quickly as possible after invoices and all proper documentation, including acceptance, are received and before normal payment due dates established in the contract (see 232.906(a)).

              Determining payment due dates.

              (d) In most cases, Government acceptance or approval can occur within the 7-day constructive acceptance period specified in the FAR Prompt Payment clauses. Government payment of construction progress payments can, in most cases, be made within the 14-day period allowed by the Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts clause. While the contracting officer may specify a longer period because the period specified in the contract is not reasonable or practical, such change should be coordinated with the Government offices responsible for acceptance or approval and for payment. Reasons for specifying a longer period include but are not limited to: the nature of the work or supplies or services, inspection or testing requirements, shipping and acceptance terms, and resources available at the acceptance activity. A constructive acceptance period of less than the cited 7 or 14 days is not authorized.

The contract or agreement number under which the order was placed may be omitted from invoices and receiving reports. The contractor may choose to identify both the contract number and the 13-character order number on invoices and receiving reports. Task and delivery orders numbered with a four-position alpha-numeric call or order serial number shall include both the 13-position basic contract Procurement Instrument Identifier and the four-position order number.

              (ii) The restrictions of FAR 32.906 prohibiting early payment do not apply to invoice payments made to small business concerns. However, contractors shall not be entitled to interest penalties if the Government fails to make early payment.

              Policy.
              (a) As with all contract financing, the purpose of performance-based payments is to assist the contractor in the payment of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. Therefore, performance-based payments should never exceed total cost incurred at any point during the contract. See PGI 232.1001(a) for additional information on use of performance-based payments.
              (d) The contracting officer shall use the following standard payment terms for performance-based payments: The contractor entitlement date, if any, specified in the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.

              (i) Agree with the offeror on price using customary progress payments before negotiation begins on the use of performance-based payments, except for modifications to contracts that already use performance-based payments;

              (ii) Analyze the performance-based payment schedule using the performance-based payments (PBP) analysis tool. The PBP analysis tool is on the DPAP Web site in the Cost, Pricing & Finance section, Performance Based Payments—Guide Book & Analysis Tool tab, at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/Performance_based_payments.html.
              
              (A) When considering performance-based payments, obtain from the offeror/contractor a proposed performance-based payments schedule that includes all performance-based payments events, completion criteria and event values along with the projected expenditure profile in order to negotiate the value of the performance events. If performance-based payments are deemed practical, the Government will evaluate and negotiate the details of the performance-based payments schedule.
              (B) For modifications to contracts that already use performance-based payments financing, the basis for negotiation must include performance-based payments. The PBP analysis tool will be used in the same manner to help determine the price for the modification. The only difference is that the baseline assuming customary progress payments will reflect an objective profit rate instead of a negotiated profit rate;
              (iii) Negotiate the consideration to be received by the Government if the performance-based payments payment schedule will be more favorable to the contractor than customary progress payments;
              (iv) Obtain the approval of the business clearance approving official, or one level above the contracting officer, whichever is higher, for the negotiated consideration; and
              (v) Document in the contract file that the performance-based payment schedule provides a mutually beneficial settlement position that reflects adequate consideration to the Government for the improved contractor cash flow.
              (c) Instructions for multiple appropriations. If the contract contains foreign military sales requirements, the contracting officer shall provide instructions for distribution of the contract financing payments to each country's account.

              As used in this subpart—
              
                Electronic form means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to affected systems.
              
                Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the contractor under a contract or task or delivery order.

              232.7002
              Policy.
              (a) Payment requests and receiving reports are required to be submitted in electronic form, except for—
              (1) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests and receiving reports could compromise the safeguarding of classified information or national security;

              (2) Cases in which contractor submission of electronic payment requests and receiving reports is not feasible (e.g., when contract performance is in an environment where internet connectivity is not available);
              (3) Cases in which DoD is unable to receive payment requests or provide acceptance in electronic form;

              (4) Cases in which the contractor has requested permission in writing to submit payment requests and receiving reports by nonelectronic means, and the contracting officer has provided instructions for a temporary alternative method of submission of payment requests and receiving reports in the contract administration data section of the contract or task or delivery order (e.g., section G, an addendum to FAR 52.212-4, or applicable clause); and
              (5) When the Governmentwide commercial purchase card is used as the method of payment, in which case only submission of the receiving report in electronic form is required.

              (b)(1) The only acceptable electronic form for submission of payment requests and receiving reports is Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) (https://wawf.eb.mil/), except as follows:

              (i) For payment of commercial transportation services provided under a Government rate tender, contract, or task or delivery order for transportation services, the use of a DoD-approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted vendor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack, Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System) is permitted.
              (ii) For submitting and processing payment requests and receiving reports for contracts or task or delivery orders for rendered health care services, the use of TRICARE Encounter Data System as the electronic form is permitted.
              (2) Facsimile, email, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms of payment requests or receiving reports.

              Procedures.
              (a) DoD officials receiving payment requests in electronic form shall process the payment requests in electronic form. The WAWF system provides the method to electronically process payment requests and receiving reports.
              (1) Documents necessary for payment, such as receiving reports, invoice approvals, contracts, contract modifications, and required certifications, shall also be processed in electronic form.
              (2) Scanned documents and other commonly used file formats are only acceptable for processing supporting documentation.

              (b) If one of the exceptions to submission in electronic form at 232.7002(a) applies, the contracting officer shall—
              

              (1) Consult the payment office and the contract administration office regarding the alternative method to be used for submission of payment requests or receiving reports (e.g., facsimile or conventional mail); and

              (2) Provide procedures for invoicing in the contract administration data section of the contract or task or delivery order (e.g., section G, an addendum to FAR 52.212-4, or applicable clause) for submission of invoices by nonelectronic means. If submission of invoices by nonelectronic means is temporary, the procedures should specify the time period for which they apply.

              Contract clauses.
              (a) Unless an exception to submission in electronic form at 232.7002(a) applies and instructions for invoices are contained in the contract administration data section of the contract or task or delivery order, use the clause at 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial items.

              234.201
              Policy.
              (1) DoD applies the earned value management system requirement as follows:
              (i) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $20,000,000 or more, the earned value management system shall comply with the guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748).
              (ii) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $50,000,000 or more, the contractor shall have an earned value management system that has been determined by the cognizant Federal agency to be in compliance with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.
              (iii) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at less than $20,000,000—
              (A) The application of earned value management is optional and is a risk-based decision;
              (B) A decision to apply earned value management shall be documented in the contract file; and
              (C) Follow the procedures at PGI 234.201(1)(iii) for conducting a cost-benefit analysis.
              (iv) For firm-fixed-price contracts and subcontracts of any dollar value—
              (A) The application of earned value management is discouraged; and

              (B) Follow the procedures at PGI 234.201(1)(iv) for obtaining a waiver before applying earned value management.
              
              (2) When an offeror proposes a plan for compliance with the earned value management system guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748, follow the review procedures at PGI 234.201(2).
              (3) The Defense Contract Management Agency is responsible for determining earned value management system compliance when DoD is the cognizant Federal agency.
              (4) See PGI 234.201(3) for additional guidance on earned value management.
              (5) The cognizant contracting officer, in consultation with the functional specialist and auditor, shall—
              (i) Determine the acceptability of the contractor's earned value management system and approve or disapprove the system; and
              (ii) Pursue correction of any deficiencies.
              (6) In evaluating the acceptability of a contractor's earned value management system, the contracting officer, in consultation with the functional specialist and auditor, shall determine whether the contractor's earned value management system complies with the system criteria for an acceptable earned value management system as prescribed in the clause at 252.234-7002, Earned Value Management System.
              (7) Disposition of findings—(i) Reporting of findings. The functional specialist or auditor shall document findings and recommendations in a report to the contracting officer. If the functional specialist or auditor identifies any significant deficiencies in the contractor's earned value management system, the report shall describe the deficiencies in sufficient detail to allow the contracting officer to understand the deficiencies.
              (ii) Initial determination. (A) The contracting officer shall review all findings and recommendations and, if there are no significant deficiencies, shall promptly notify the contractor, in writing, that the contractor's earned value management system is acceptable and approved; or
              (B) If the contracting officer finds that there are one or more significant deficiencies (as defined in the clause at 252.234-7002, Earned Value Management System) due to the contractor's failure to meet one or more of the earned value management system criteria in the clause at 252.234-7002, the contracting officer shall—
              (1) Promptly make an initial written determination on any significant deficiencies and notify the contractor, in writing, providing a description of each significant deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the contractor to understand the deficiencies;
              (2) Request the contractor to respond, in writing, to the initial determination within 30 days; and
              (3) Evaluate the contractor's response to the initial determination, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, and make a final determination.
              (iii) Final determination. (A) The contracting officer shall make a final determination and notify the contractor, in writing, that—
              (1) The contractor's earned value management system is acceptable and approved, and no significant deficiencies remain, or
              (2) Significant deficiencies remain. The notice shall identify any remaining significant deficiencies, and indicate the adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action. The contracting officer shall—
              (i) Request that the contractor, within 45 days of receipt of the final determination, either correct the deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the deficiencies;
              (ii) Disapprove the system in accordance with the clause at 252.234-7002, Earned Value Management System, when initial validation is not successfully completed within the timeframe approved by the contracting officer, or the contracting officer determines that the existing earned value management system contains one or more significant deficiencies in high-risk guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 standards (guidelines 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, or 32). When the contracting officer determines that the existing earned value management system contains one or more significant deficiencies in one or more of the remaining 16 guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 standards, the contracting officer shall use discretion to disapprove the system based on input received from functional specialists and the auditor; and
              (iii) Withhold payments in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, if the clause is included in the contract.
              (B) Follow the procedures relating to monitoring a contractor's corrective action and the correction of significant deficiencies at PGI 234.201(7).
              (8) System approval. The contracting officer shall promptly approve a previously disapproved earned value management system and notify the contractor when the contracting officer determines that there are no remaining significant deficiencies.
              (9) Contracting officer notifications. The cognizant contracting officer shall promptly distribute copies of a determination to approve a system, disapprove a system and withhold payments, or approve a previously disapproved system and release withheld payments to the auditor; payment office; affected contracting officers at the buying activities; and cognizant contracting officers in contract administration activities.

              Policy.
              (a) Major weapon systems. (1) A DoD major weapon system may be treated as a commercial item, or acquired under procedures established for the acquisition of commercial items, only if—
              (i) The Secretary of Defense determines that—
              (A) The major weapon system is a commercial item as defined in FAR 2.101; and
              (B) Such treatment is necessary to meet national security objectives; and
              (ii) The congressional defense committees are notified at least 30 days before such treatment or acquisition occurs. Follow the procedures at PGI 234.7002.
              (2) The authority of the Secretary of Defense to make a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may not be delegated below the level of the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
              (b) Subsystems. A subsystem of a major weapon system (other than a commercially available off-the-shelf item) shall be treated as a commercial item and acquired under procedures established for the acquisition of commercial items if—

              (1) The subsystem is intended for a major weapon system that is being acquired, or has been acquired, under procedures established for the acquisition of commercial items in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or
              (2) The contracting officer determines in writing that the subsystem is a commercial item.
              (c) Components and spare parts. (1) A component or spare part for a major weapon system (other than a commercially available off-the-shelf item) may be treated as a commercial item if—
              (i) The component or spare part is intended for—
              (A) A major weapon system that is being acquired, or has been acquired, under procedures established for the acquisition of commercial items in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or
              (B) A subsystem of a major weapon system that is being acquired, or has been acquired, under procedures established for the acquisition of commercial items in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; or
              (ii) The contracting officer determines in writing that the component or spare part is a commercial item.
              (2) This paragraph (c) shall apply only to components and spare parts that are acquired by DoD through a prime contract or a modification to a prime contract, or through a subcontract under a prime contract or modification to a prime contract on which the prime contractor adds no, or negligible, value.
              (d) Relevant information. This section implements 10 U.S.C. 2379.
              (1) To the extent necessary to make a determination of price reasonableness, the contracting officer shall require the offeror to submit prices paid for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial customers.
              (2) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request the offeror to submit information on—
              (i) Prices paid for the same or similar items under different terms and conditions;
              (ii) Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;
              (iii) Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and
              (iv) Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for a price reasonableness determination.
              (3) If the contracting officer determines that the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request the offeror to submit other relevant information, including uncertified cost data. However, no uncertified cost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price.
              (4) An offeror shall not be required to submit information described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section with regard to a commercially available off-the-shelf item. An offeror may be required to submit such information with regard to any other item that was developed exclusively at private expense only after the head of the contracting activity determines in writing that the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price.

            Special use allowances for research facilities acquired by educational institutions.
            (a) Definitions. As used in this subsection—
            (1) Research facility means—
            (i) Real property, other than land; and
            (ii) Includes structures, alterations, and improvements, acquired for the purpose of conducting scientific research under contracts with departments and agencies of the DoD.
            (2) Special use allowance means a negotiated direct or indirect allowance—
            (i) For construction or acquisition of buildings, structures, and real property, other than land; and

            (ii) Where the allowance is computed at an annual rate exceeding the rate which normally would be allowed under FAR subpart 31.3.
            
            (b) Policy. (1) Educational institutions are to furnish the facilities necessary to perform Defense contracts. FAR 31.3 governs how much the Government will reimburse the institution for the research programs. However, in extraordinary situations, the Government may give special use allowances to an educational institution when the institution is unable to provide the capital for new laboratories or expanded facilities needed for Defense contracts.
            (2) Decisions to provide a special use allowance must be made on a case-by-case basis, using the criteria in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
            (c) Authorization for special use allowance. The head of a contracting activity may approve special use allowances only when all of the following conditions are met—
            (1) The research facility is essential to the performance of DoD contracts;
            (2) Existing facilities, either Government or nongovernment, cannot meet program requirements practically or effectively;
            (3) The proposed agreement for special use allowances is a sound business arrangement;
            (4) The Government's furnishing of Government-owned facilities is undesirable or impractical; and
            (5) The proposed use of the research facility is to conduct essential Government research which requires the new or expanded facilities.
            (d) Application of the special use allowance. (1) In negotiating a special use allowance—
            (i) Compare the needs of DoD and of the institution for the research facility to determine the amount of the special use allowance;
            (ii) Consider rental costs for similar space in the area where the research facility is or will be located to establish the annual special use allowance;
            (iii) Do not include or allow—
            (A) The costs of land; or
            (B) Interest charges on capital;
            (iv) Do not include maintenance, utilities, or other operational costs;
            (v) The period of allowance generally will be—
            (A) At least ten years; or
            (B) A shorter period if the total amount to be allowed is less than the construction or acquisition cost for the research facility;
            (vi) Generally, provide for allocation of the special use allowance equitably among the Government contracts using the research facility;
            (vii) Special use allowances apply only in the years in which the Government has contracts in effect with the institution. However, if in any given year there is a reduced level of Government research effort which results in the special use allowance being excessive compared to the Government research funding, a separate special use allowance may be negotiated for that year;
            (viii) Special use allowances may be adjusted for the period before construction is complete if the facility is partially occupied and used for Government research during that period.
            (2) A special use allowance may be based on either total or partial cost of construction or acquisition of the research facility.
            (i) When based on total cost neither the normal use allowance nor depreciation will apply—
            (A) During the special use allowance period; and
            (B) After the educational institution has recovered the total construction or acquisition cost from the Government or other users.
            (ii) When based on partial cost, normal use allowance and depreciation—
            (A) Apply to the balance of costs during the special use allowance period to the extent negotiated in the special use allowance agreement; and
            (B) Do not apply after the special use allowance period, except for normal use allowance applied to the balance.
            (3) During the special use allowance period, the research facility—
            (i) Shall be available for Government research use on a priority basis over nongovernment use; and
            (ii) Cannot be put to any significant use other than that which justified the special use allowance, unless the head of the contracting activity, who approved the special use allowance, consents.

            (4) The Government will pay only an allocable share of the special use allowance when the institution makes any substantial use of the research facility for parties other than the Government during the period when the special use allowance is in effect.
            (5) In no event shall the institution be paid more than the acquisition costs.

              Expediting construction contracts.
              (a) 10 U.S.C. 2858 requires agency head approval to expedite the completion date of a contract funded by a Military Construction Appropriations Act, if additional costs are involved. This approval authority may not be redelegated. The approval authority must—
              (1) Certify that the additional expenditures are necessary to protect the National interest; and
              (2) Establish a reasonable completion date for the project.

              (1) Results in a list of sources determined to be qualified to perform a specific construction contract; and
              (2) Limits offerors to those with proven competence to perform in the required manner.
              (b) The head of the contracting activity must—
              (1) Authorize the use of prequalification by determining, in writing, that a construction project is of an urgency or complexity that requires prequalification; and
              (2) Approve the prequalification procedures.
              (c) For small businesses, the prequalification procedures must require the qualifying authority to—
              (1) Request a preliminary recommendation from the appropriate Small Business Administration regional office, if the qualifying authority believes a small business is not responsible;
              (2) Permit the small business to submit a bid or proposal if the preliminary recommendation is that the small business is responsible; and
              (3) Follow the procedures in FAR 19.6, if the small business is in line for award and is found nonresponsible.

              237.104
              Personal services contracts.
              (b)(i) Authorization to acquire the personal services of experts and consultants is included in 10 U.S.C. 129b. Personal service contracts for expert and consultant services must also be authorized by a determination and findings (D&F) in accordance with department/agency regulations.
              (A) Generally, the D&F should authorize one contract at a time; however, an authorizing official may issue a blanket D&F for classes of contracts.
              (B) Prepare each D&F in accordance with FAR 1.7 and include a determination that—
              (1) The duties are of a temporary or intermittent nature;
              (2) Acquisition of the services is advantageous to the national defense;
              (3) DoD personnel with necessary skills are not available;
              (4) Excepted appointment cannot be obtained;
              (5) A nonpersonal services contract is not practicable;
              (6) Statutory authority, 5 U.S.C. 3109 and other legislation, apply; and
              (7) Any other determination required by statutes has been made.
              (ii) Personal services contracts for health care are authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1091.
              (A) This authority may be used to acquire—
              (1) Direct health care services provided in medical treatment facilities;
              (2) Health care services at locations outside of medical treatment facilities (such as the provision of medical screening examinations at military entrance processing stations); and
              (3) Services of clinical counselors, family advocacy program staff, and victim's services representatives to members of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries who require such services, provided in medical treatment facilities or elsewhere. Persons with whom a personal services contract may be entered into under this authority include clinical social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other comparable professionals who have advanced degrees in counseling or related academic disciplines and who meet all requirements for State licensure and board certification requirements, if any, within their fields of specialization.
              (B) Sources for personal services contracts with individuals under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1091 shall be selected through the procedures in this section. These procedures do not apply to contracts awarded to business entities other than individuals. Selections made using the procedures in this section are exempt by statute from FAR part 6 competition requirements (see 206.001(b)).
              (C) Approval requirements for—
              (1) Direct health care personal services contracts (see paragraphs (b)(ii)(A)(1) and (2) of this section) and a pay cap are in DoDI 6025.5, Personal Services Contracts for Health Care Providers.
              (i) A request to enter into a personal services contract for direct health care services must be approved by the commander of the medical/dental treatment facility where the services will be performed.
              (ii) A request to enter into a personal services contract for a location outside of a medical treatment facility must be approved by the chief of the medical facility who is responsible for the area in which the services will be performed.
              (2) Services of clinical counselors, family advocacy program staff, and victim's services representatives (see paragraph (b)(ii)(A)(3) of this section), shall be in accordance with agency procedures.
              
              (D) The contracting officer must ensure that the requiring activity provides a copy of the approval with the purchase request.
              (E) The contracting officer must provide adequate advance notice of contracting opportunities to individuals residing in the area of the facility. The notice must include the qualification criteria against which individuals responding will be evaluated. The contracting officer shall solicit applicants through at least one local publication which serves the area of the facility. Acquisitions under this section for personal service contracts are exempt from the posting and synopsis requirements of FAR part 5.
              (F) The contracting officer shall provide the qualifications of individuals responding to the notice to the commander of the facility for evaluation and ranking in accordance with agency procedures. Individuals must be considered solely on the basis of the professional qualifications established for the particular personal services being acquired and the Government's estimate of reasonable rates, fees, or other costs. The commander of the facility shall provide the contracting officer with rationale for the ranking of individuals, consistent with the required qualifications.
              (G) Upon receipt from the facility of the ranked listing of applicants, the contracting officer shall either—
              (1) Enter into negotiations with the highest ranked applicant. If a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, the contracting officer shall terminate negotiations with the highest ranked applicant and enter into negotiations with the next highest.
              (2) Enter into negotiations with all qualified applicants and select on the basis of qualifications and rates, fees, or other costs.
              (H) In the event only one individual responds to an advertised requirement, the contracting officer is authorized to negotiate the contract award. In this case, the individual must still meet the minimum qualifications of the requirement and the contracting officer must be able to make a determination that the price is fair and reasonable.
              (I) If a fair and reasonable price cannot be obtained from a qualified individual, the requirement should be canceled and acquired using procedures other than those set forth in this section.
              (iii) (A) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 129b(d), an agency may enter into a personal services contract if—
              (1) The personal services—
              (i) Are to be provided by individuals outside the United States, regardless of their nationality;
              (ii) Directly support the mission of a defense intelligence component or counter-intelligence organization of DoD; or
              (iii) Directly support the mission of the special operations command of DoD; and
              (2) The head of the contracting activity provides written approval for the proposed contract. The approval shall include a determination that addresses the following:
              (i) The services to be procured are urgent or unique;
              (ii) It would not be practical to obtain such services by other means; and
              (iii) For acquisition of services in accordance with paragraph (b)(iii)(A)(1)(i) of this section, the services to be acquired are necessary and appropriate for supporting DoD activities and programs outside the United States.

              (B) The contracting officer shall ensure that the applicable requirements of paragraph (b)(iii)(A)(2) of this section have been satisfied and shall include the approval documentation in the contract file.
              (iv) The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 3109, Employment of Experts and Consultants; Temporary or Intermittent, do not apply to contracts entered into in accordance with paragraph (b)(iii) of this section.
              (d) See 237.503(c) for requirements for certification and approval of requirements for services to prevent contracts from being awarded or administered in a manner that constitutes an unauthorized personal services contract.

              (f)(i) Payment to each expert or consultant for personal services under 5 U.S.C. 3109 shall not exceed the highest rate fixed by the Classification Act Schedules for grade GS-15 (see 5 CFR 304.105(a)).
              
              (ii) The contract may provide for the same per diem and travel expenses authorized for a Government employee, including actual transportation and per diem in lieu of subsistence for travel between home or place of business and official duty station.
              (iii) Coordinate with the civilian personnel office on benefits, taxes, personnel ceilings, and maintenance of records.

Contracting officers shall follow the procedures at PGI 237.503, include substantially similar certifications in conjunction with service contract requirements, and place the certification in the contract file. The program manager or other official responsible for the requirement, at a level specified by the agency, should execute the certification. In addition, contracting officers and program managers should remain aware of the descriptive elements at FAR 37.104(d) to ensure that a service contract does not inadvertently become administered as a personal-services contract.

              General.
              Generally, agencies will acquire services of students at institutions of higher learning by contract between a nonprofit organization employing the student and the Government. When it is in the best interest of the Government, contracts may be made directly with students. These services are not subject to the requirements of FAR part 19, FAR 13.003(b)(1), or DFARS part 219. Award authority for these contracts is 10 U.S.C. 2304(a)(1) and 10 U.S.C. 2360.

              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              
                Covered item of supply means an item of information technology that is purchased for inclusion in a covered system, and the loss of integrity of which could result in a supply chain risk for a covered system (see 10 U.S.C. 2339a).
              
                Covered system means a national security system, as that term is defined at 44 U.S.C. 3552(b) (see 10 U.S.C. 2339a). It is any information system, including any telecommunications system, used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency—
              (1) The function, operation, or use of which—
              (i) Involves intelligence activities;
              (ii) Involves cryptologic activities related to national security;
              (iii) Involves command and control of military forces;
              (iv) Involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or
              (v) Is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions but this does not include a system that is to be used for routine administrative and business applications, including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications; or
              (2) Is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.
              
                Information technology (see 40 U.S.C 11101(6)) means, in lieu of the definition at FAR 2.1, any equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment, that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency.
              (1) For purposes of this definition, equipment is used by an agency if the equipment is used by the agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires—
              (i) Its use; or
              (ii) To a significant extent, its use in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.
              (2) The term “information technology” includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources.
              (3) The term “information technology” does not include any equipment acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract.
              
                Supply chain risk means the risk that an adversary may sabotage, maliciously introduce unwanted function, or otherwise subvert the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of a covered system so as to surveil, deny, disrupt, or otherwise degrade the function, use, or operation of such system (see 10 U.S.C. 2339a).

              Applicability.
              Notwithstanding FAR 39.001, this subpart shall be applied to acquisition of information technology for covered systems (see 10 U.S.C. 2339a), for procurements involving—
              (a) A source selection for a covered system or a covered item of supply involving either a performance specification (see 10 U.S.C. 2305(a)(1)(C)(ii)), or an evaluation factor (see 10 U.S.C. 2305(a)(2)(A)), relating to supply chain risk;

              (b) The consideration of proposals for and issuance of a task or delivery order for a covered system or a covered item of supply where the task or delivery order contract concerned includes a requirement relating to supply chain risk (see 10 U.S.C. 2304c(d)(3) and FAR 16.505(b)(1)(iv)(D)); or
              (c) Any contract action involving a contract for a covered system or a covered item of supply where such contract includes a requirement relating to supply chain risk.

              Delegated authority for telecommunications resources.
              The contracting officer may enter into a telecommunications service contract on a month-to-month basis or for any longer period or series of periods, not to exceed a total of 10 years. See PGI 239.7405 for documents relating to this contracting authority, which the General Services Administration has delegated to DoD.

              Certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data.
              (a) Common carriers are not required to submit certified cost or pricing data before award of contracts for tariffed services. Rates or preliminary estimates quoted by a common carrier for tariffed telecommunications services are considered to be prices set by regulation within the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2306a. This is true even if the tariff is set after execution of the contract.
              (b) Rates or preliminary estimates quoted by a common carrier for nontariffed telecommunications services or by a noncommon carrier for any telecommunications service are not considered prices set by law or regulation.

              (c) Contracting officers shall obtain sufficient data to determine that the prices are reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.403-3 or 15.403-4. See PGI 239.7406 for examples of instances where additional data may be necessary to determine price reasonableness.

              Special construction.
            
            
              239.7408-1
              General.
              (a) Special construction normally involves a common carrier giving a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements.
              This may include—
              (1) Moving or relocating equipment;
              (2) Providing temporary facilities;
              (3) Expediting provision of facilities; or
              (4) Providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements.
              (b) Use this subpart instead of FAR part 36 for acquisition of “special construction.”
              (c) Special construction costs may be—

              (1) A contingent liability for using telecommunications services for a shorter time than the minimum to reimburse the contractor for unamortized nonrecoverable costs. These costs are usually expressed in terms of a termination liability, as provided in the contract or by tariff;
              (2) A onetime special construction charge;
              (3) Recurring charges for constructed facilities;
              (4) A minimum service charge;
              (5) An expediting charge; or
              (6) A move or relocation charge.
              (d) When a common carrier submits a proposal or quotation which has special construction requirements, the contracting officer shall require a detailed special construction proposal. Analyze all special construction proposals to—
              (1) Determine the adequacy of the proposed construction;
              (2) Disclose excessive or duplicative construction; and
              (3) When different forms of charge are possible, provide for the form of charge most advantageous to the Government.
              (e) When possible, analyze and approve special construction charges before receiving the service. Impose a ceiling on the special construction costs before authorizing the contractor to proceed, if prior approval is not possible. The contracting officer must approve special construction charges before final payment.

              239.7408-2
              Applicability of construction labor standards for special construction.
              (a) The construction labor standards in FAR Subpart 22.4 ordinarily do not apply to special construction. However, if the special construction includes construction, alteration, or repair (as defined in FAR 22.401) of a public building or public work, the construction labor standards may apply. Determine applicability under FAR 22.402.
              (b) Each CSA or other type contract which is subject to construction labor standards under FAR 22.402 shall cite that fact.

              239.7409
              Special assembly.
              (a) Special assembly is the designing, manufacturing, arranging, assembling, or wiring of equipment to provide telecommunications services that cannot be provided with general use equipment.
              (b) Special assembly rates and charges shall be based on estimated costs. The contracting officer should negotiate special assembly rates and charges before starting service. When it is not possible to negotiate in advance, use provisional rates and charges subject to adjustment, until final rates and charges are negotiated. The CSAs authorizing the special assembly shall be modified to reflect negotiated final rates and charges.

              Cancellation and termination.
              (a)(1) Cancellation is stopping a requirement after placing of an order but before service starts.
              (2) Termination is stopping a requirement after placing an order and after service starts.
              (b) Determine cancellation or termination charges under the provisions of the applicable tariff or agreement/contract.
            
            
              239.7411
              Contract clauses.
              (a) In addition to other appropriate FAR and DFARS clauses, use the following clauses in solicitations, contracts, and basic agreements for telecommunications services. Modify the clauses only if necessary to meet the requirements of a governmental regulatory agency.

              (3) Rates established by an independent regulatory body—
              (i) Are considered “prices set by law or regulation”;
              (ii) Are sufficient to set prices without obtaining certified cost or pricing data (see FAR subpart 15.4); and
              (iii) Are a valid basis on which prices can be determined fair and reasonable.
              (4) Compliance with the regulations, practices, and decisions of independent regulatory bodies as a matter of comity is not a substitute for the procedures at FAR 41.202(a).

              Procedures.
              (1) Connection and service charges. The Government may pay a connection charge when required to cover the cost of the necessary connecting facilities. A connection charge based on the estimated labor cost of installing and removing the facility shall not include salvage cost. A lump-sum connection charge shall be no more than the agreed cost of the connecting facilities less net salvage. The order of precedence for contractual treatment of connection and service charges is—
              (i) No connection charge.
              (ii) Termination liability. Use when an obligation is necessary to secure the required services. The obligation must be not more than the agreed connection charge, less any net salvage material costs. Use of a termination liability instead of a connection charge requires the approval of the service power procurement officer or designee.
              (iii) Connection charge, refundable. Use a refundable connection charge when the supplier refuses to provide the facilities based on lack of capital or published rules which prohibit providing up-front funding. The contract should provide for refund of the connection charge within five years unless a longer period or omission of the refund requirement is authorized by the service power procurement officer or designee.
              (iv) Connection and service charges, nonrefundable. The Government may pay certain nonrefundable, nonrecurring charges including service initiation charges, a contribution in aid of construction, membership fees, and charges required by the supplier's rules and regulations to be paid by the customer. If possible, consider sharing with other than Government users the use of (and costs for) facilities when large nonrefundable charges are required.
              (2) Construction and labor requirements. Follow the procedures at PGI 241.202(2) for construction and labor requirements associated with connection and service charges.

              (2) Use a clause substantially the same as the clause at FAR 52.241-8, Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for Unregulated Services, when the utility services to be provided are not subject to a regulatory body or are subject to a nonindependent regulatory body.

              (b) Use the clause at 252.241-70001, Government Access, when the clause at FAR 52.241-5, Contractor's Facilities, is used.

                “(7)(i) Except as set forth in subparagraph (7)(ii) below, the Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related increases, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from the transfer or this Agreement, other than those that the Government in the absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been obligated to pay or reimburse under the terms of the contracts.
                (ii) The Government recognizes that restructuring by the Transferee incidental to the acquisition/merger may be in the best interests of the Government. Restructuring costs that are allowable under Part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or Part 231 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) may be reimbursed under flexibily-priced novated contracts, provided the Transferee demonstrates that the restructuring will reduce overall costs to the Department of Defense (DoD) (and to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), where there is a mix of DoD and NASA contracts), and the requirements included in DFARS 231.205-70 are met. Restructuring costs shall not be allowed on novated contracts unless there is an audit of the restructuring proposal; a determination by the contracting officer of overall reduced costs to DoD/NASA; and an Advance Agreement setting forth a cumulative cost ceiling for restructuring projects and the period to which such costs shall be assigned.”

              (a) Definitions. As used in this subpart—
              
                Acceptable contractor business systems and contractor business systems are defined in the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems.
              
                Covered contract means a contract that is subject to the Cost Accounting Standards under 41 U.S.C. chapter 15, as implemented in regulations found at 48 CFR 9903.201-1 (see the FAR Appendix) (10 U.S.C. 2302 note, as amended by section 816 of Pub. L. 112-81).
              
                Significant deficiency is defined in the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems.
              (b) Determination to withhold payments. If the contracting officer makes a final determination to disapprove a contractor's business system in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, the contracting officer shall—
              (1) In accordance with agency procedures, identify one or more covered contracts containing the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, from which payments will be withheld. When identifying the covered contracts from which to withhold payments, the contracting officer shall ensure that the total amount of payment withholding under 252.242-7005, does not exceed 10 percent of progress payments, performance-based payments, and interim payments under cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contracts billed under each of the identified covered contracts. Similarly, the contracting officer shall ensure that the total amount of payment withholding under the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, for each business system does not exceed five percent of progress payments, performance-based payments, and interim payments under cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contracts billed under each of the identified covered contracts. The contracting officer has the sole discretion to identify the covered contracts from which to withhold payments.
              (2) Promptly notify the contractor, in writing, of the contracting officer's determination to implement payment withholding in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems. The notice of payment withholding shall be included in the contracting officer's written final determination for the contractor business system and shall inform the contractor that—
              (i) Payments shall be withheld from the contract or contracts identified in the written determination in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, until the contracting officer determines that there are no remaining significant deficiencies; and
              (ii) The contracting officer reserves the right to take other actions within the terms and conditions of the contract.
              (3) Provide all contracting officers administering the selected contracts from which payments will be withheld, a copy of the determination. The contracting officer shall also provide a copy of the determination to the auditor; payment office; affected contracting officers at the buying activities; and cognizant contracting officers in contract administration activities.
              (c) Monitoring contractor's corrective action. The contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, shall monitor the contractor's progress in correcting the deficiencies. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor of any decision to decrease or increase the amount of payment withholding in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems.
              (d) Correction of significant deficiencies. (1) If the contractor notifies the contracting officer that the contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the contracting officer shall request the auditor or functional specialist to review the correction to verify that the deficiencies have been corrected. If, after receipt of verification, the contracting officer determines that the contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the contracting officer's final determination, the contracting officer shall discontinue the withholding of payments, release any payments previously withheld, and approve the system, unless other significant deficiencies remain.
              (2) Prior to the receipt of verification, the contracting officer may discontinue withholding payments pending receipt of verification, and release any payments previously withheld, if the contractor submits evidence that the significant deficiencies have been corrected, and the contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, determines that there is a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented and are expected to correct the significant deficiencies.
              (3) Within 90 days of receipt of the contractor notification that the contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the contracting officer shall—
              (i) Make a determination that—
              
              (A) The contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the contracting officer's final determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section;
              (B) There is a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or
              (C) The contractor has not corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the contracting officer's final determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or there is not a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or
              (ii) Reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies covered under the corrective action plan by at least 50 percent of the amount being withheld from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the contractor, in writing, to reduce the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers by at least 50 percent, until the contracting officer makes a determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.
              (4) If, at any time, the contracting officer determines that the contractor has failed to correct the significant deficiencies identified in the contractor's notification, the contracting officer will continue, reinstate, or increase withholding from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the contractor, in writing, to continue, reinstate, or increase the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to the percentage initially withheld, until the contracting officer determines that the contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the contracting officer's final determination.
              (e) For sample formats for written notifications of contracting officer determinations to initiate payment withholding, reduce payment withholding, and discontinue payment withholding in accordance with the clause at DFARS 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, see PGI 242.7000.

              Scope of subpart.

              (a) This subpart provides policies, procedures, and standards for use in the evaluation of a contractor's material management and accounting system (MMAS).
              
              (b) The policies, procedures, and standards in this subpart—
              (1) Apply only when the contractor has contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that are not for the acquisition of commercial items and are either—
              (i) Cost-reimbursement contracts; or
              (ii) Fixed-price contracts with progress payments made on the basis of costs incurred by the contractor as work progresses under the contract; and
              (2) Do not apply to small businesses, educational institutions, or nonprofit organizations.

              Definitions.
              
                Acceptable material management and accounting system, material management and accounting system, and valid time-phased requirements are defined in the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management and Accounting System.
              
                Significant deficiency is defined in the clause at 252.242.7004, Material Management and Accounting System.

              242.7202
              Policy.
              (a) DoD policy is for its contractors to have an MMAS that conforms to the standards in paragraph (d) of the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management and Accounting System, so that the system—
              (1) Reasonably forecasts material requirements;
              (2) Ensures the costs of purchased and fabricated material charged or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements; and
              (3) Maintains a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for costing of material transactions.
              (b) The cognizant contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor and functional specialist, if appropriate, shall—
              (1) Determine the acceptability of the contractor's MMAS and approve or disapprove the system; and
              (2) Pursue correction of any deficiencies.
              (c) In evaluating the acceptability of the contractor's MMAS, the contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor and functional specialist, if appropriate, shall determine whether the contractor's MMAS complies with the system criteria for an acceptable MMAS as prescribed in the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management and Accounting System.

              242.7203
              Review procedures.
              (a) Criteria for conducting reviews. Conduct an MMAS review when—
              (1) A contractor has $40 million of qualifying sales to the Government during the contractor's preceding fiscal year; and
              (2) The administrative contracting officer (ACO), with advice from the auditor, determines an MMAS review is needed based on a risk assessment of the contractor's past experience and current vulnerability.
              (b) Qualifying sales. Qualifying sales are sales for which certified cost or pricing data were required under 10 U.S.C. 2306a, as implemented in FAR 15.403, or that are contracts priced on other than a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis. Sales include prime contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to such contracts and subcontracts.
              (c) Disposition of findings—(1) Reporting of findings. The auditor or functional specialist shall document findings and recommendations in a report to the contracting officer. If the auditor or functional specialist identifies any significant MMAS deficiencies, the report shall describe the deficiencies in sufficient detail to allow the contracting officer to understand the deficiencies.
              (2) Initial determination. (i) The contracting officer shall review findings and recommendations and, if there are no significant deficiencies, shall promptly notify the contractor, in writing, that the contractor's MMAS is acceptable and approved; or

              (ii) If the contracting officer finds that there are one or more significant deficiencies (as defined in the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management and Accounting System) due to the contractor's failure to meet one or more of the MMAS system criteria in the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management and Accounting System, the contracting officer shall—
              
              (A) Promptly make an initial written determination on any significant deficiencies and notify the contractor, in writing, providing a description of each significant deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the contractor to understand the deficiency;
              (B) Request the contractor to respond, in writing, to the initial determination within 30 days; and
              (C) Promptly evaluate the contractor's response to the initial determination in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, and make a final determination.
              (3) Final determination. (i) The ACO shall make a final determination and notify the contractor that—
              (A) The contractor's MMAS is acceptable and approved, and no deficiencies remain, or
              (B) Significant deficiencies remain. The notice shall identify any remaining significant deficiencies, and indicate the adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action. The contracting officer shall—
              (1) Request that the contractor, within 45 days of receipt of the final determination, either correct the deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the deficiencies;
              (2) Disapprove the system in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management and Accounting System; and
              (3) Withhold payments in accordance with the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, if the clause is included in the contract.
              (ii) Follow the procedures relating to monitoring a contractor's corrective action and the correction of significant deficiencies in PGI 242.7203.
              (d) System approval. The contracting officer shall promptly approve a previously disapproved MMAS and notify the contractor when the contracting officer determines that there are no remaining significant deficiencies.
              (e) Contracting officer notifications. The cognizant contracting officer shall promptly distribute copies of a determination to approve a system, disapprove a system and withhold payments, or approve a previously disapproved system and release withheld payments to the auditor; payment office; affected contracting officers at the buying activities; and cognizant contracting officers in contract administration activities.

            Subpart 242.73—Contractor Insurance/Pension Review
            
              242.7301
              General.
              (a) The administrative contracting officer (ACO) is responsible for determining the allowability of insurance/pension costs in Government contracts and for determining the need for a Contractor/Insurance Pension Review (CIPR). Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) insurance/pension specialists and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) auditors assist ACOs in making these determinations, conduct CIPRs when needed, and perform other routine audits as authorized under FAR 42.705 and 52.215-2. A CIPR is a DCMA/DCAA joint review that—
              (1) Provides an in-depth evaluation of a contractor's—
              (i) Insurance programs;
              (ii) Pension plans;
              (iii) Other deferred compensation plans; and
              (iv) Related policies, procedures, practices, and costs; or

              (2) Concentrates on specific areas of the contractor's insurance programs, pension plans, or other deferred compensation plans.
              
              (b) DCMA is the DoD Executive Agent for the performance of all CIPRs.
              (c) DCAA is the DoD agency designated for the performance of contract audit responsibilities related to Cost Accounting Standards administration as described in FAR subparts 30.2 and 30.6 as they relate to a contractor's insurance programs, pension plans, and other deferred compensation plans.

              242.7302
              Requirements.
              (a)(1) An in-depth CIPR as described at DFARS 242.7301(a)(1) shall be conducted only when—
              (i) A contractor has $50 million of qualifying sales to the Government during the contractor's preceding fiscal year; and
              (ii) The ACO, with advice from DCMA insurance/pension specialists and DCAA auditors, determines a CIPR is needed based on a risk assessment of the contractor's past experience and current vulnerability.
              (2) Qualifying sales are sales for which certified cost or pricing data were required under 10 U.S.C. 2306a, as implemented in FAR 15.403, or that are contracts priced on other than a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis. Sales include prime contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to such contracts and subcontracts.
              (b) A special CIPR that concentrates on specific areas of a contractor's insurance programs, pension plans, or other deferred compensation plans shall be performed for a contractor (including, but not limited to, a contractor meeting the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section) when any of the following circumstances exists, but only if the circumstance(s) may result in a material impact on Government contract costs:
              (1) Information or data reveals a deficiency in the contractor's insurance/pension program.
              (2) The contractor proposes or implements changes in its insurance, pension, or deferred compensation plans.
              (3) The contractor is involved in a merger, acquisition, or divestiture.
              (4) The Government needs to follow up on contractor implementation of prior CIPR recommendations.
              (c) The DCAA auditor shall use relevant findings and recommendations of previously performed CIPRs in determining the scope of any audits of insurance and pension costs.
              (d) When a Government organization believes that a review of the contractor's insurance/pension program should be performed, that organization should provide a recommendation for a review to the ACO. If the ACO concurs, the review should be performed as part of an ACO-initiated special CIPR or as part of a CIPR already scheduled for the near future.

              242.7400
              General.
              (a) Program managers may conclude that they need technical representation in contractor facilities to perform non-contract administration service (CAS) technical duties and to provide liaison, guidance, and assistance on systems and programs. In these cases, the program manager may assign technical representatives under the procedures in 242.7401.
              (b) A technical representative is a representative of a DoD program, project, or system office performing non-CAS technical duties at or near a contractor facility. A technical representative is not—
              (1) A representative of a contract administration or contract audit component; or
              (2) A contracting officer's representative (see 201.602).

              (2) Initial determination. (i) The contracting officer shall review findings and recommendations and, if there are no significant deficiencies, shall promptly notify the contractor, in writing, that the contractor's accounting system is acceptable and approved; or
              (ii) If the contracting officer finds that there are one or more significant deficiencies (as defined in the clause at 252.242-7006, Accounting System Administration) due to the contractor's failure to meet one or more of the accounting system criteria in the clause at 252.242-7006, the contracting officer shall—

              (1) Field pricing teams shall discuss identified accounting system deficiencies and their impact in all reports on contractor proposals until the deficiencies are resolved.

              (2) The contracting officer responsible for negotiation of a proposal generated by an accounting system with an identified deficiency shall evaluate whether the deficiency impacts the negotiations. See also PGI 242.7502(g)(2). If it does not, the contracting officer should proceed with negotiations. If it does, the contracting officer should consider other alternatives, e.g.—
              (i) Allowing the contractor additional time to correct the accounting system deficiency and submit a corrected proposal;
              (ii) Considering another type of contract;
              (iii) Using additional cost analysis techniques to determine the reasonableness of the cost elements affected by the accounting system's deficiency;

              (i) Clearly identify the amounts and items that are in question at the time of negotiation;
              (ii) Indicate a specific time or subsequent event by which the contractor will submit a supplemental proposal, including certified cost or pricing data, identifying the cost impact adjustment necessitated by the deficient accounting system;
              (iii) Provide for the contracting officer to adjust the contract price unilaterally if the contractor fails to submit the supplemental proposal; and
              (iv) Provide that failure of the Government and the contractor to agree to the price adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause.

              (a) This subsection applies to unpriced change orders with an estimated value exceeding $5 million.
              (b) Unpriced change orders for foreign military sales and special access programs are not subject to this subsection, but the contracting officer shall apply the policy and procedures to them to the maximum extent practicable. If the contracting officer determines that it is impracticable to adhere to the policy and procedures of this subsection for an unpriced change order for a foreign military sale or a special access program, the contracting officer shall provide prior notice, through agency channels, to the Deputy Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (Contract Policy and International Contracting), 3060 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3060.

              Definitization schedule.
              (a) Unpriced change orders shall contain definitization schedules that provide for definitization by the earlier of—
              (1) The date that is 180 days after issuance of the change order (this date may be extended but may not exceed the date that is 180 days after the contractor submits a qualifying proposal); or
              (2) The date on which the amount of funds obligated under the change order is equal to more than 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price.

              (b) Submission of a qualifying proposal in accordance with the definitization schedule is a material element of the contract. If the contractor does not submit a timely qualifying proposal, the contracting officer may suspend or reduce progress payments under FAR 32.503-6, or take other appropriate action.

              (a) The Government shall not obligate more than 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price before definitization. However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal before 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price has been obligated by the Government, the limitation on obligations before definitization may be increased to no more than 75 percent (see 232.102-70 for coverage on provisional delivery payments).
              (b) Obligations should be consistent with the contractor's requirements for the undefinitized period.

              (b) The limitations in 243.204-70-4(a) do not apply to unpriced change orders for ship construction and ship repair.
              (c) The head of the agency may waive the limitations in 243.204-70-2, 243.204-70-3, and 243.204-70-4 for unpriced change orders if the head of the agency determines that the waiver is necessary to support—

              Allowable profit.
              When the final price of an unpriced change order is negotiated after a substantial portion of the required performance has been completed, the head of the contracting activity shall ensure the profit allowed reflects—
              (a) Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs incurred during contract performance before negotiation of the final price;
              (b) Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs expected to be incurred during performance of the remainder of the contract; and
              (c) The extent to which costs have been incurred prior to definitization of the unpriced change order (see 215.404-71-3(d)(2)). The risk assessment shall be documented in the price negotiation memorandum .

              Certification of requests for equitable adjustment.
              (a) A request for equitable adjustment to contract terms that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold may not be paid unless the contract certifies the request in accordance with the clause at 252.243-7002.
              (b) To determine if the dollar threshold for requiring certification is met, add together the absolute value of each cost increase and each cost decrease. See PGI 243.204-71(b) for an example.

              (c) The certification required by 10 U.S.C. 2410(a), as implemented in the clause at 252.243-7002, is different from the certification required by 41 U.S.C. 7103, Disputes. If the contractor has certified a request for equitable adjustment in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2410(a), and desires to convert the request to a claim under the Contract Disputes statute, the contractor shall certify the claim in accordance with FAR Subpart 33.2.

              (ii) If the contracting officer finds that there are one or more significant deficiencies (as defined in the clause at 252.244-7001, Contractor Purchasing System Administration) due to the contractor's failure to meet one or more of the purchasing system criteria in the clause at 252.244-7001, the contracting officer shall—

              (1) Source selection evaluation teams shall discuss identified purchasing system deficiencies and their impact in all reports on contractor proposals until the deficiencies are resolved.

              (2) The contracting officer responsible for negotiation of a proposal generated by a purchasing system with an identified deficiency shall evaluate whether the deficiency impacts the negotiations. If it does not, the contracting officer should proceed with negotiations. If it does, the contracting officer should consider other alternatives, e.g.—
              (i) Allowing the contractor additional time to correct the purchasing system deficiency and submit a corrected proposal;
              (ii) Considering another type of contract, e.g., a fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract instead of firm-fixed-price;
              (iii) Using additional cost analysis techniques to determine the reasonableness of the cost elements affected by the purchasing system's deficiency;
              (iv) Segregating the questionable areas as a cost-reimbursable line item;
              (v) Reducing the negotiation objective for profit or fee; or
              (vi) Including a contract (reopener) clause that provides for adjustment of the contract amount after award.
              (3) The contracting officer who incorporates a reopener clause into the contract is responsible for negotiating price adjustments required by the clause. Any reopener clause necessitated by a purchasing system deficiency should—
              (i) Clearly identify the amounts and items that are in question at the time of negotiation;
              (ii) Indicate a specific time or subsequent event by which the contractor will submit a supplemental proposal, including certified cost or pricing data, identifying the cost impact adjustment necessitated by the deficient purchasing system;
              (iii) Provide for the contracting officer to adjust the contract price unilaterally if the contractor fails to submit the supplemental proposal; and
              (iv) Provide that failure of the Government and the contractor to agree to the price adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause.

              Policy.
              (See the policy guidance at PGI 245.102-70.)
              (1) Mapping, charting, and geodesy property. All Government-furnished mapping, charting, and geodesy (MC&G) property is under the control of the Director, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.
              (i) MC&G property shall not be duplicated, copied, or otherwise reproduced for purposes other than those necessary for contract performance.
              (ii) Upon completion of contract performance, the contracting officer shall—
              (A) Contact the Director, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, 7500 Geoint Drive, Springfield, VA 22150, for disposition instructions;
              (B) Direct the contractor to destroy or return all Government-furnished MC&G property not consumed during contract performance; and
              (C) Specify the destination and means of shipment for property to be returned to the Government.
              (2) Government supply sources. When a contractor will be responsible for preparing requisitioning documentation to acquire Government-furnished property from Government supply sources, include in the contract the requirement to prepare the documentation in accordance with DoD 4000.25-1-M, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP). Copies are available from the address cited at PGI 251.102.
              (3) Acquisition and management of industrial resources. See Subpart 237.75 for policy relating to facilities projects.
              (4) Government-furnished property identification.
              
              (i) It is DoD policy that Government-furnished property be tagged, labeled, or marked based on DoD marking standards (MIL Standard 130) or other standards, when the requiring activity determines that such items are subject to serialized item management (serially-managed items). The list of Government-furnished property subject to serialized item management will be identified in the contract in accordance with PGI 245.103-72, GFP attachments to solicitations and awards.
              (ii) Exceptions. The Contractor will not be required to tag, label, or mark—
              (A) Government-furnished property that was previously tagged, labeled, or marked;
              (B) Items, as determined by the head of the agency, that are to be used to support a contingency operation; or to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack;
              (C) Items for which a determination and findings has been executed concluding that it is more cost effective for the Government requiring activity to assign, mark, and register the unique item identification after delivery of an item acquired from a small business concern or a commercial item acquired under FAR part 12 or part 8.
              (1) The determination and findings shall be executed by—
              (i) The Component Acquisition Executive for an Acquisition Category (ACAT) I program; or
              (ii) The head of the contracting activity for all other programs.
              (2) A copy of the executed determination and findings shall be provided to the DoD Unique Item Identification Policy Office at this address: OUSD (AT&L) DPAP/Program Development and Implementation, Room 3B855, 3060 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-3060; or by facsimile to 703-602-6047.
              (D) Items that are contractor-acquired property;
              (E) Property under any statutory leasing authority;
              (F) Property to which the Government has acquired a lien or title solely because of partial, advance, progress, or performance-based payments;
              (G) Intellectual property or software; or
              (H) Real property.
              
              (5) Reporting loss of Government property. The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) eTools software application is the DoD data repository for reporting loss of Government property in the possession of contractors. The requirements and procedures for reporting loss of Government property to eTools are set forth in the clause at 252.245-7002, Reporting Loss of Government Property, prescribed at 245.107.

              (d) Disposition of findings—(1) Reporting of findings. The property administrator shall document findings and recommendations in a report to the contracting officer.

              (ii) If the contracting officer finds that there are one or more significant deficiencies (as defined in the clause at 252.245-7003, Contractor Property Management System Administration) due to the contractor's failure to meet one or more of the property management system criteria in the clause at 252.245-7003, the contracting officer shall—

              Contracts with foreign governments or international organizations.
              (1) General.
              
              (i) Approval. A contractor may use Government property on work for foreign governments and international organizations only when approved in writing by the contracting officer having cognizance of the property. The contracting officer may grant approval, provided—
              (A) The use will not interfere with foreseeable requirements of the United States;
              (B) The work is undertaken as a DoD foreign military sale; or
              (C) For a direct commercial sale, the foreign country or international organization would be authorized to contract with the department concerned under the Arms Export Control Act.
              (ii) Use charges.
              
              (A) The Use and Charges clause is applicable on direct commercial sales to foreign governments or international organizations.
              (B) When a particular foreign government or international organization has funded the acquisition of property, do not assess the foreign government or international organization rental charges or nonrecurring recoupments for the use of such property.
              (2) Special tooling and special test equipment.
              
              (i) DoD normally recovers a fair share of nonrecurring costs of special tooling and special test equipment by including these costs in its calculation of the nonrecurring cost recoupment charge when major defense equipment is sold by foreign military sales or direct commercial sales to foreign governments or international organizations. “Major defense equipment” is defined in DoD Directive 2140.2, Recoupment of Nonrecurring Costs on Sales of U.S. Items, as any item of significant military equipment on the United States Munitions List having a nonrecurring research, development, test, and evaluation cost of more than $50 million or a total production cost of more than $200 million.
              (ii) When the cost thresholds in paragraph (2)(i) of this section are not met, the contracting officer shall assess rental charges for use of special tooling and special test equipment pursuant to the Use and Charges clause if administratively practicable.
              (3) Waivers.
                
              
              (i) Rental charges for use of U.S. production and research property on commercial sales transactions to the Government of Canada are waived for all commercial contracts. This waiver is based on an understanding wherein the Government of Canada has agreed to waive its rental charges.
              (ii) Requests for waiver or reduction of charges for the use of Government property on work for foreign governments or international organizations shall be submitted to the contracting officer, who is authorized to approve the requests in consultation with the appropriate functional specialist.

              Inventory disposal schedules.
              For termination inventory, plant clearance officers shall verify inventory schedules, either directly or through appropriate technical personnel, to determine the following:
              (a) Allocability.
              
              (1) Review contract requirements, delivery schedules, bills of material, and other pertinent documents to determine whether schedules include property that—
              (i) Is appropriate for use on the contract; or
              (ii) Exceeds the quantity required for completion of the contract, but could be diverted to other commercial work or Government use.
              (2) Review the contractor's—
              (i) Recent purchases of similar material;
              (ii) Plans for current and scheduled production;
              (iii) Stock record entries; and
              (iv) Bills of material for similar items.
              (b) Quantity. Take measures to provide assurance that available inventory is in accordance with quantities listed on the inventory schedules. Quantities may be verified by actual item count, acceptance of labeled quantities in unopened/sealed packages, scale counts, or other appropriate methods.
              (c) Condition. Ensure that the physical condition of the property is reasonably consistent with the Federal Condition Code supplied by the contractor.
            
            
              245.602-3
              Screening.

              Property will be screened DoD-wide, including the contracting agency, requiring agency, and, as appropriate, the General Services Administration. The requiring agency shall have priority for retention of listed items. All required screening must be completed before any sale of contractor inventory, including contractor inventory in overseas locations (foreign excess personal property) can take place. Upon request of the prospective reutilization, transfer, donation, or sales customer, the plant clearance officer shall arrange for inspection of property at the contractor's plant in such a manner as to avoid interruption of the contractor's operations, and consistent with any security requirements.
            
            
              245.602-70

              245.604-3
              Sale of surplus property.
              (a) Plant clearance officers shall determine a best value sales approach (formal or informal sales), to include due consideration for costs, risks, and benefits, e.g., potential sales proceeds.
              (b) Informal bid procedures. The plant clearance officer may direct the contractor to issue informal invitations for bid (orally, telephonically, or by other informal media), provided—
              (1) Maximum practical competition is obtained;
              (2) Sources solicited are recorded; and
              (3) Informal bids are confirmed in writing.
              (c) Sale approval and award. Plant clearance officers shall—
              (1) Evaluate bids to establish that the sale price is fair and reasonable, taking into consideration—
              (i) Knowledge or tests of the market;
              (ii) Current published prices for the property;
              (iii) The nature, condition, quantity, and location of the property; and
              (iv) Past sale history for like or similar items;
              (2) Approve award to the responsible bidder whose bid is most advantageous to the Government. The plant clearance officer shall not approve award to any bidder who is an ineligible transferee, as defined in 252.245-7004, Reporting, Reutilization, and Disposal; and
              (3) Notify the contractor of the bidder to whom an award will be made within five working days from receipt of bids.
              (d) Noncompetitive sales.
              
              (1) Noncompetitive sales include purchases or retention at less than cost by the contractor. Noncompetitive sales may be made when—
              (i) The plant clearance officer determines that this method is essential to expeditious plant clearance; and
              (ii) The Government's interests are adequately protected.
              (2) Noncompetitive sales shall be at fair and reasonable prices, not less than those reasonably expected under competitive sales.
              (3) Conditions justifying noncompetitive sales are—
              (i) No acceptable bids are received under competitive sale;
              (ii) Anticipated sales proceeds do not warrant competitive sale;
              (iii) Specialized nature of the property would not create bidder interest;
              (iv) Removal of the property would reduce its value or result in disproportionate handling expenses; or
              (v) Such action is essential to the Government's interests.
              (e) Plant clearance officers shall consider any special disposal requirements such as demilitarization or trade security control requirements in accordance with DoDM 4160.28-M, Defense Demilitarization Manual, and DoDI 2030.08, Implementation of Trade Security Controls, respectively (See PGI 245.6).]

              (a) General. (1) Ordinarily, a representative of the contract administration office signs or stamps the shipping papers that accompany Government source-inspected supplies to release them for shipment. This is done for both prime and subcontracts.
              (2) An alternative procedure (see paragraph (b) of this section) permits the contractor to assume the responsibility for releasing the supplies for shipment.
              (3) The alternative procedure may include prime contractor release of supplies inspected at a subcontractor's facility.
              (4) The use of the alternative procedure releases DoD manpower to perform technical functions by eliminating routine signing or stamping of the papers accompanying each shipment.

              (1) For foreign military sales contracts, do not use alternative procedures.(2) The contract administration office may authorize, in writing, the contractor to release supplies for shipment when—

              (i) The stamping or signing of the shipping papers by a representative of the contract administration office interferes with the operation of the Government contract quality assurance program or takes too much of the Government representative's time;
              (ii) There is sufficient continuity of production to permit the Government to establish a systematic and continuing evaluation of the contractor's control of quality; and
              (iii) The contractor has a record of satisfactory quality, including that pertaining to preparation for shipment.
              (3) The contract administration office shall withdraw, in writing, the authorization when there is an indication that the conditions in paragraph (b)(2) of this subsection no longer exist.
              (4) When the alternative procedure is used, require the contractor to—

              (i) Type or stamp, and sign, the following statement on the required copy or copies of the shipping paper(s), or on an attachment—

                Defect means any condition or characteristic in any supply or service furnished by the contractor under the contract that is not in compliance with the requirements of the contract.
              
                Enterprise means the entity (e.g., a manufacturer or vendor) responsible for granting the warranty and/or assigning unique item identifiers to serialized warranty items.
              
                Enterprise identifier means a code that is uniquely assigned to an enterprise by an issuing agency.
              
                Issuing agency means an organization responsible for assigning a globally unique identifier to an enterprise, as indicated in the Register of Issuing Agency Codes for International Standards Organization/International Electrotechnical Commission 15459, located at http://www.aimglobal.org/?Reg_Authority15459.

              246.708
              Warranties of data.
              Obtain warranties on technical data when practicable and cost effective. Consider the factors in FAR 46.703 in deciding whether to obtain warranties of technical data. Consider the following in deciding whether to use extended liability provisions—
              (1) The likelihood that correction or replacement of the nonconforming data, or a price adjustment, will not give adequate protection to the Government; and
              (2) The effectiveness of the additional remedy as a deterrent against furnishing nonconforming data.
            
            
              246.710
              Solicitation provision and contract clauses.
              (1) Use a clause substantially the same as the basic or one of the alternates of the clause at 252.246-7001, Warranty of Data, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software, when there is a need for greater protection or period of liability than provided by the inspection and warranty clauses prescribed in FAR part 46.

              (i) Use the basic clause in solicitations and contracts that are not firm-fixed price or fixed-price incentive.
              
              (ii) Use alternate I in fixed-price-incentive solicitations and contracts.
              (iii) Use alternate II in firm-fixed-price solicitations and contracts.
              (2) Use the clause at 252.246-7002, Warranty of Construction (Germany), instead of the clause at FAR 52.246-21, Warranty of Construction, in solicitations and contracts for construction when a fixed-price contract will be awarded and contract performance will be in Germany.
              (3) When the solicitation includes the clause at 252.211-7003, Item Unique Identification and Valuation, which is prescribed in 211.274-6(a), and it is anticipated that the resulting contract will include a warranty for serialized items—
              (i) Use the provision at 252.246-7005, Notice of Warranty Tracking of Serialized Items, in the solicitation if the Government does not specify a warranty and offerors will be required to enter data with the offer;
              (ii) Use the clause at 252.246-7006, Warranty Tracking of Serialized Items, in the solicitation and contract; and

              (iii) Include the following warranty attachments, available at https://www.pdrep.csd.disa.mil/pdrep_files/other/wsr.htm, in the solicitation and contract and see 246.710-70:
              (A) Warranty Tracking Information.

              Policy.
              (a) Sources of electronic parts. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Government requires contractors and subcontractors at all tiers, to—
              (i) Obtain electronic parts that are in production by the original manufacturer or an authorized aftermarket manufacturer or currently available in stock from—
              (A) The original manufacturers of the parts;
              (B) Their authorized suppliers; or
              (C) Suppliers that obtain such parts exclusively from the original manufacturers of the parts or their authorized suppliers; and

              (ii) Obtain electronic parts that are not in production by the original manufacturer or an authorized aftermarket manufacturer, and that are not currently available in stock from a source listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, from suppliers identified by the Contractor as contractor-approved suppliers, provided that—

              (A) For identifying and approving such contractor-approved suppliers, the contractor uses established counterfeit prevention industry standards and processes (including inspection, testing, and authentication), such as the DoD-adopted standards at https://assist.dla.mil;
              
              (B) The contractor assumes responsibility for the authenticity of parts provided by such contractor-approved suppliers (see 231.205-71); and
              (C) The selection of such contractor-approved suppliers is subject to review, audit, and approval by the Government, generally in conjunction with a contractor purchasing system review or other surveillance of purchasing practices by the contract administration office, or if the Government obtains credible evidence that a contractor-approved supplier has provided counterfeit parts. The contractor may proceed with the acquisition of electronic parts from a contractor-approved supplier unless otherwise notified by DoD.
              (2) The Government requires contractors and subcontractors to comply with the notification, inspection, testing, and authentication requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(iv) of the clause at 252.246-7008, Sources of Electronic Parts, if the contractor—
              (i) Obtains an electronic part from—

              (ii) Cannot confirm that an electronic part is new or not previously used and that it has not been comingled in supplier new production or stock with used, refurbished, reclaimed, or returned parts.
              (3) Contractors and subcontractors are still required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable, if—
              (i) Authorized to purchase electronic parts from the Federal Supply Schedule;
              (ii) Purchasing electronic parts from suppliers accredited by the Defense Microelectronics Activity; or
              (iii) Requisitioning electronic parts from Government inventory/stock under the authority of the clause at 252.251-7000, Ordering from Government Supply Sources.
              (A) The cost of any required inspection, testing, and authentication of such parts may be charged as a direct cost.
              (B) The Government is responsible for the authenticity of the requisitioned electronic parts. If any such part is subsequently found to be counterfeit or suspect counterfeit, the Government will—
              (1) Promptly replace such part at no charge; and
              (2) Consider an adjustment in the contract schedule to the extent that replacement of the counterfeit or suspect counterfeit electronic parts caused a delay in performance.

(1) Contractors that are subject to the cost accounting standards and that supply electronic parts or products that include electronic parts, and their subcontractors that supply electronic parts or products that include electronic parts, are required to establish and maintain an acceptable counterfeit electronic part detection and avoidance system. Failure to do so may result in disapproval of the purchasing system by the contracting officer and/or withholding of payments (see 252.244-7001, Contractor Purchasing System Administration).
              (2) System criteria. A counterfeit electronic part detection and avoidance system shall include risk-based policies and procedures that address, at a minimum,the following areas (see the clause at 252.246-7007, Contractor Counterfeit Electronic Part Detection and Avoidance System):
              (i) The training of personnel.
              (ii) The inspection and testing of electronic parts, including criteria for acceptance and rejection.

              (iii) Processes to abolish counterfeit parts proliferation.
              
              (iv) Processes for maintaining electronic part traceability.
              (v) Use of suppliers in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
              (vi) The reporting and quarantining of counterfeit electronic parts and suspect counterfeit electronic parts.

              (2) Computed by dividing the hourly stevedoring gang cost by the estimated number of tons of the specified commodity that can be handled in 1 hour.
              
                Gang cost is—
              (1) The total hourly wages paid to the workers in the gang, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement between the maritime industry and the unions at a specific port; and

              Scope.
              This subpart—
              (a) Implements—
              (1) The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (“the 1904 Act”), 10 U.S.C. 2631, which applies to the ocean transportation of cargo owned by, or destined for use by, DoD;
              (2) Section 1017 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Pub. L. 109-364), which requires consideration, in solicitations requiring a covered vessel, of the extent to which offerors have had overhaul, repair, and maintenance work performed in shipyards located in the United States or Guam; and
              (3) Section 3504 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417), which addresses requirements that apply to riding gang members and DoD-exempted individuals (see 252.247-7027(c)) who perform work on U.S.-flag vessels under DoD contracts for transportation services documented under chapter 121, title 46 U.S.C.
              (b) Does not specifically implement the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 (“the 1954 Act”), 46 U.S.C. 1241(b). The 1954 Act is applicable to DoD, but DFARS coverage is not required because compliance with the 1904 Act historically has resulted in DoD exceeding the 1954 Act's requirements; and
              (c) Does not apply to ocean transportation of the following products, in which case FAR subpart 47.5 applies:
              (1) Products obtained for contributions to foreign assistance programs.
              (2) Products owned by agencies other than DoD, unless the products are clearly identifiable for eventual use by DoD.

              (1) Those vessels are not available;
              (2) The proposed charges to the Government are higher than charges to private persons for the transportation of like goods; or
              (3) The proposed freight charges are excessive or unreasonable.

              (b) Contracts must provide for the use of Government-owned vessels when security classifications prohibit the use of other than Government-owned vessels.
              (c) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2631(b)—
              (1) Any vessel used under a time charter contract for the transportation of supplies under this section shall have any reflagging or repair work, as defined in the clause at 252.247-7025, Reflagging or Repair Work, performed in the United States or its outlying areas, if the reflagging or repair work is performed—
              (i) On a vessel for which the contractor submitted an offer in response to the solicitation for the contract; and
              (ii) Prior to the acceptance of the vessel by the Government.
              (2) The Secretary of Defense may waive this requirement if the Secretary determines that such waiver is critical to the national security of the United States.
              (d) In accordance with Section 1017 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Public Law 109-364)—
              (1) When obtaining carriage requiring a covered vessel, the contracting officer must consider the extent to which offerors have had overhaul, repair, and maintenance work for covered vessels performed in shipyards located in the United States or Guam; and
              (2) DoD must submit an annual report to the congressional defense committees, addressing the information provided by offerors with regard to overhaul, repair, and maintenance for covered vessels performed in the United States or Guam.
              (e) In accordance with section 3504 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417), DoD may not award, renew or extend, or exercise an option under a charter of, or contract for carriage of cargo by, a U.S.-flag vessel documented under chapter 121 of title 46 U.S.C., unless the contract contains the clause at 252.247-7027.

              249.501-70
              Special termination costs.
              (a) The clause at 252.249-7000, Special Termination Costs, may be used in an incrementally funded contract when its use is approved by the agency head.
              (b) The clause is authorized when—
              (1) The contract term is 2 years or more;
              (2) The contract is estimated to require—
              (i) Total RDT&E financing in excess of $25 million; or
              (ii) Total production investment in excess of $100 million; and
              (3) Adequate funds are available to cover the contingent reserve liability for special termination costs.
              (c) The contractor and the contracting officer must agree upon an amount that represents their best estimate of the total special termination costs to which the contractor would be entitled in the event of termination of the contract. Insert this amount in paragraph (c) of the clause.
              (d)(1) Consider substituting an alternate paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic clause when—
              (i) The contract covers an unusually long performance period; or
              (ii) The contractor's cost risk associated with contingent special termination costs is expected to fluctuate extensively over the period of the contract.
              (2) The alternate paragraph (c) should provide for periodic negotiation and adjustment of the amount reserved for special termination costs. Occasions for periodic adjustment may include—
              (i) The Government's incremental assignment of funds to the contract;
              (ii) The time when certain performance milestones are accomplished by the contractor; or
              (iii) Other specific time periods agreed upon by the contracting officer and the contractor.

              249.7000
              Terminated contracts with Canadian Commercial Corporation.
              (a) Terminate contracts with the Canadian Commercial Corporation in accordance with—

              (1) The Letter of Agreement (LOA) between the Department of Defence Production (Canada) and the U.S. DoD, “Canadian Agreement” (for a copy of the LOA or for questions on its currency, contact the Office of the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (Contract Policy and International Contracting), osd.pentagon.ousd-atl.mbx.cpic@mail.mil);
              (2) Policies in the Canadian Agreement and part 249; and

              (3) The Canadian Supply Manual, Chapter 8, Annex 8.3, available at http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/ga-sm/index-eng.html, “Termination for Convenience Process, Public Works and Government Services Canada.”
              (b) Contracting officers shall ensure that the Canadian Commercial Corporation submits termination settlement proposals in the format prescribed in FAR 49.602 and that they contain the amount of settlements with subcontractors. The termination contracting officer (TCO) shall prepare an appropriate settlement agreement. (See FAR 49.603.) The letter transmitting a settlement proposal must certify—
              (1) That disposition of inventory has been completed; and
              (2) That the Contract Claims Resolution Board of the Public Works and Government Services Canada has approved settlements with Canadian subcontractors when the Procedures Manual on Termination of Contracts requires such approval.
              (c)(1) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will—
              (i) Settle all Canadian subcontractor termination claims under the Canadian Agreement; and
              (ii) Submit schedules listing serviceable and usable contractor inventory for screening to the TCO (see FAR 45.6).
              (2) After screening, the TCO must provide guidance to the Canadian Commercial Corporation for disposition of the contractor inventory.
              (3) Settlement of Canadian subcontractor claims are not subject to the approval and ratification of the TCO. However, when the proposed negotiated settlement exceeds the total contract price of the prime contract, the TCO shall obtain from the U.S. contracting officer prior to final settlement—
              (i) Ratification of the proposed settlement; and
              (ii) A contract modification increasing the contract price and obligating the additional funds.
              (d) The Canadian Commercial Corporation should send all termination settlement proposals submitted by U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to the TCO of the cognizant contract administration office of the Defense Contract Management Agency for settlement. The TCO will inform the Canadian Commercial Corporation of the amount of the net settlement of U.S. subcontractors and suppliers so that this amount can be included in the Canadian Commercial Corporation termination proposal. The Canadian Commercial Corporation is responsible for execution of the settlement agreement with these subcontractors.
              (e) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will continue administering contracts that the U.S. contracting officer terminates.
              (f) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will settle all Canadian subcontracts in accordance with the policies, practices, and procedures of the Canadian Government.
              (g) The U.S. agency administering the contract with the Canadian Commercial Corporation shall provide any services required by the Canadian Commercial Corporation, including disposal of inventory, for settlement of any subcontracts placed in the United States. Settlement of such U.S. subcontracts will be in accordance with this regulation.

              Congressional notification is required for any termination involving a reduction in employment of 100 or more contractor employees. Proposed terminations must be cleared through department/agency liaison offices before release of the termination notice, or any information on the proposed termination, to the contractor.

              (b) Departments and agencies are responsible for establishing procedures to:
              (1) Identify which contracts (if any) under major defense programs will be terminated or substantially reduced as a result of the funding levels provided in an appropriations act.
              (2) Within 60 days of the enactment of such an act, provide notice of the anticipated termination of or substantial reduction in the funding of affected contracts—
              (i) Directly to the Secretary of Labor; and
              (ii) Through the contracting officer to each prime contractor.
              (c) Use the clause at 252.249-7002, Notification of Anticipated Contract Termination or Reduction, in all contracts under a major defense program.

                  (2) For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply:

                  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, “Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations” (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171) in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.

                  (ii)(A) The Contractor shall implement NIST SP 800-171, as soon as practical, but not later than December 31, 2017. For all contracts awarded prior to October 1, 2017, the Contractor shall notify the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), via email at osd.dibcsia@mail.mil, within 30 days of contract award, of any security requirements specified by NIST SP 800-171 not implemented at the time of contract award.
                  (B) The Contractor shall submit requests to vary from NIST SP 800-171 in writing to the Contracting Officer, for consideration by the DoD CIO. The Contractor need not implement any security requirement adjudicated by an authorized representative of the DoD CIO to be nonapplicable or to have an alternative, but equally effective, security measure that may be implemented in its place.
                  (C) If the DoD CIO has previously adjudicated the contractor's requests indicating that a requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally effective, a copy of that approval shall be provided to the Contracting Officer when requesting its recognition under this contract.

                  (D) If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the Government for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.

                  (3) Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.
                  (c) Cyber incident reporting requirement.
                  
                  (1) When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall—
                  (i) Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractor's network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and
                  (ii) Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
                  
                  (2) Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.
                    
                  
                  (3) Medium assurance certificate requirement. In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents. For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, see http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/Pages/index.aspx.
                  (d) Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.
                  (e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.
                  (f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.
                  (g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.
                  (h) DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.
                  (i) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD—
                  (1) To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;
                  (2) To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents;
                  (3) To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations;
                  (4) For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or
                  (5) To a support services contractor (“recipient”) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.
                  (j) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government's use and release of such information.
                  (k) The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.
                  (l) Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.
                  (m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall—

                  (1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and
                  
                  (2) Require subcontractors to—
                  (i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and
                  (ii) Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.

                  (1) Lead system integrator includes lead system integrator with system responsibility and lead system integrator without system responsibility.
                  
                  (2) Lead system integrator with system responsibility means a prime contractor for the development or production of a major system, if the prime contractor is not expected at the time of award to perform a substantial portion of the work on the system and the major subsystems.

L. 111-23), if awarded the contract, the contractor or any affiliate of the contractor is prohibited from participating as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor in the development or production of a weapon system under the major defense acquisition program or pre-major defense acquisition program, unless the offeror submits, and the Government approves, an Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan.
                  (d) Request for an exception. If the offeror requests an exception to the prohibition of paragraph (c) of this provision, then the offeror shall submit an Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan with its offer for evaluation.
                  (e) Incorporation of Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan in contract.

                  (d) Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan. If the Contractor submitted an acceptable Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan that has been incorporated into this contract, then the prohibition in paragraph (c) of this clause does not apply. The Contractor shall comply with the Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan. Compliance with the Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan is a material requirement of the contract.

                252.215-7010
                Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data.
                
                  Basic. As prescribed in 215.408(5)(i) and (5)(i)(A), use the following provision:
                
                  Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data—Basic (JUL 2019)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this provision—
                  
                    Market prices means current prices that are established in the course of ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be substantiated through competition or from sources independent of the offerors.
                  
                    Non-Government sales means sales of the supplies or services to non-Governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes.
                  
                    Relevant sales data means information provided by an offeror on sales of the same or similar items that can be used to establish price reasonableness taking into consideration the age, volume, and nature of the transactions (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments).
                  
                    Sufficient non-Government sales means relevant sales data that reflects market pricing and contains enough information to make adjustments covered by FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)(B).
                  
                    Uncertified cost data means the subset of “data other than certified cost or pricing data” (see FAR 2.101) that relates to cost.
                  (b) Exceptions from certified cost or pricing data. (1) In lieu of submitting certified cost or pricing data, the Offeror may submit a written request for exception by submitting the information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this provision. The Contracting Officer may require additional supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether an exception should be granted and whether the price is fair and reasonable.
                  (i) Exception for prices set by law or regulation—Identification of the law or regulation establishing the prices offered. If the prices are controlled under law by periodic rulings, reviews, or similar actions of a governmental body, attach a copy of the controlling document, unless it was previously submitted to the contracting office.
                  (ii) Commercial item exception. For a commercial item exception, the Offeror shall submit, at a minimum, information that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition, including prices at which the same item or similar items have been sold in the commercial market. Such information shall include—
                  (A) For items previously determined to be commercial, the contract number and military department, defense agency, or other DoD component that rendered such determination, and if available, a Government point of contact;
                  (B) For items priced based on a catalog—
                  (1) A copy of or identification of the Offeror's current catalog showing the price for that item; and
                  (2) If the catalog pricing provided with this proposal is not consistent with all relevant sales data, a detailed description of differences or inconsistencies between or among the relevant sales data, the proposed price, and the catalog price (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments);
                  
                  (C) For items priced based on market pricing, a description of the nature of the commercial market, the methodology used to establish a market price, and all relevant sales data. The description shall be adequate to permit the DoD to verify the accuracy of the description;
                  (D) For items included on an active Federal Supply Service Multiple Award Schedule contract, proof that an exception has been granted for the schedule item; or
                  (E) For items provided by nontraditional defense contractors, a statement that the entity is not currently performing and has not performed, for at least the 1-year period preceding the solicitation of sources by DoD for the procurement or transaction, any contract or subcontract for DoD that is subject to full coverage under the cost accounting standards prescribed pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 1502 and the regulations implementing such section.
                  (2) The Offeror grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine, at any time before award, books, records, documents, or other directly pertinent records to verify any request for an exception under this provision, and to determine the reasonableness of price.
                  (c) Requirements for certified cost or pricing data. If the Offeror is not granted an exception from the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data, the following applies:
                  (1) The Offeror shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data and supporting attachments in accordance with the instructions contained in Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408, which is incorporated by reference with the same force and effect as though it were inserted here in full text. The instructions in Table 15-2 are incorporated as a mandatory format to be used in any resultant contract, unless the Contracting Officer and the Offeror agree to a different format and change this provision to use Alternate I.
                  (2) As soon as practicable after agreement on price, but before contract award (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts), the Offeror shall submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2.

                  (3) The Offeror is responsible for determining whether a subcontractor qualifies for an exception from the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data on the basis of adequate price competition, i.e., two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Government's expressed requirement in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(c)(1)(i).
                  (d) Requirements for data other than certified cost or pricing data. (1) Data other than certified cost or pricing data submitted in accordance with this provision shall include the minimum information necessary to permit a determination that the proposed price is fair and reasonable, to include the requirements in DFARS 215.402(a)(i) and 215.404-1(b).
                  (2) In cases in which uncertified cost data is required, the information shall be provided in the form in which it is regularly maintained by the Offeror or prospective subcontractor in its business operations.
                  (3) Within 10 days of a written request from the Contracting Officer for additional information to permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price in accordance with FAR 15.403-3, the Offeror shall provide either the requested information, or a written explanation for the inability to fully comply.
                  (4) Subcontract price evaluation. (i) Offerors shall obtain from subcontractors the minimum information necessary to support a determination of price reasonableness, as described in FAR part 15 and DFARS part 215.
                  (ii) No cost data may be required from a prospective subcontractor in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price.
                  (iii) If the Offeror relies on relevant sales data for similar items to determine the price is reasonable, the Offeror shall obtain only that technical information necessary—
                  (A) To support the conclusion that items are technically similar; and
                  (B) To explain any technical differences that account for variances between the proposed prices and the sales data presented.
                  (e) Subcontracts. The Offeror shall insert the substance of this provision, including this paragraph (e), in subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold defined in FAR part 2. The Offeror shall require prospective subcontractors to adhere to the requirements of—
                  (1) Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this provision for subcontracts above the threshold for submission of certified cost or pricing data in FAR 15.403-4; and
                  (2) Paragraph (d) of this provision for subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold defined in FAR part 2.
                
                (End of provision)
                
                
                  Alternate I. As prescribed in 215.408(5)(i) and (5)(i)(B), use the following provision, which includes a different paragraph (c)(1).
                
                  Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data—Alternate I (JUN 2019)

                    Market prices means current prices that are established in the course of ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be substantiated through competition or from sources independent of the offerors.
                  
                  
                    Non-Government sales means sales of the supplies or services to non-Governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes.
                  
                    Relevant sales data means information provided by an offeror on sales of the same or similar items that can be used to establish price reasonableness taking into consideration the age, volume, and nature of the transactions (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments).
                  
                    Sufficient non-Government sales means relevant sales data that reflects market pricing and contains enough information to make adjustments covered by FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)(B).

                  (b) Exceptions from certified cost or pricing data. (1) In lieu of submitting certified cost or pricing data, the Offeror may submit a written request for exception by submitting the information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this provision. The Contracting Officer may require additional supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether an exception should be granted and whether the price is fair and reasonable.
                  (i) Exception for price set by law or regulation—Identification of the law or regulation establishing the price offered.

                  (1) A copy of or identification of the Offeror's current catalog showing the price for that item; and
                  (2) If the catalog pricing provided with this proposal is not consistent with all relevant sales data, a detailed description of differences or inconsistencies between or among the relevant sales data, the proposed price, and the catalog price (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments);
                  (C) For items priced based on market pricing, a description of the nature of the commercial market, the methodology used to establish a market price, and all relevant sales data. The description shall be adequate to permit the DoD to verify the accuracy of the description;
                  (D) For items included on an active Federal Supply Service Multiple Award Schedule contract, proof that an exception has been granted for the schedule item; or
                  (E) For items provided by nontraditional defense contractors, a statement that the entity is not currently performing and has not performed, for at least the 1-year period preceding the solicitation of sources by the DoD for the procurement or transaction, any contract or subcontract for the DoD that is subject to full coverage under the cost accounting standards prescribed pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 1502 and the regulations implementing such section.

                Exception from Certified Cost or Pricing Data Requirements for Foreign Military Sales Indirect Offsets.
                As prescribed in 215.408(8), use the following clause:
                
                  Exception From Certified Cost or Pricing Data Requirements for Foreign Military Sales Indirect Offsets (JUN 2018)
                  (a) Definition. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Offset means a benefit or obligation agreed to by a contractor and a foreign government or international organization as an inducement or condition to purchase supplies or services pursuant to a foreign military sale (FMS). There are two types of offsets: Direct offsets and indirect offsets.
                  (i) A direct offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are directly related to the item being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.

                  (ii) An indirect offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are not directly related to the specific item(s) being purchased and are not integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road or other facility. Indirect offsets would also include projects that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract (e.g., a project to develop or advance a capability, technology transfer, or know-how in a foreign company). Indirect offsets may be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.
                  (b) Exceptions from certified cost or pricing data requirements. Notwithstanding the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-20, Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data, in the case of this contract or a subcontract, and FAR 52.215-21, Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data—Modifications, in the case of modification of this contract or a subcontract, submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required to the extent such data relates to an indirect offset (10 U.S.C. 2306a(b)(1)).

                  Economic Price Adjustment—Basic Steel, Aluminum, Brass, Bronze, or Copper Mill Products (MAR 2012)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Established price means a price which is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public.
                  
                    Unit price excludes any part of the price which reflects requirements for preservation, packaging, and packing beyond standard commercial practice.

                  (b) As represented by the Contractor in its offer, the unit price stated for ________ (Identify the item) is not in excess of the Contractor's established price in effect on the date set for opening of bids (or the contract date if this is a negotiated contract) for like quantities of the same item. This price is the net price after applying any applicable standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor from its catalog, list, or schedule price.
                  (c) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any established price.
                  (1) Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased.
                  (2) This decrease shall apply to items delivered on or after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price.
                  (3) This contract shall be modified accordingly.
                  (d) If the Contractor's established price is increased after the date set for opening of bids (or the contract date if this is a negotiated contract), upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and this contract shall be modified accordingly, provided—
                  (1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this contract shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit price;

                  (2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective on the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contractor's written request is received by the Contracting Officer within ten days of the change. If it is not, the effective date of the increased unit price shall be the date of receipt of the request by the Contracting Officer; and
                  (3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price unless the Contractor's failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause of this contract.
                  (4) The Contracting Officer shall not execute a modification incorporating an increase in a contract unit price under this clause until the increase is verified.
                  (e) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any portion of the contract affected by the requested increase and not delivered at the time of such cancellation, except as follows—
                  (1) The Contractor may, after that time, deliver any items that were completed or in the process of manufacture at the time of receipt of the cancellation notice, provided the Contractor notifies the Contracting Officer of such items within 10 days after the Contractor receives the cancellation notice.
                  (2) The Government shall pay for those items at the contract unit price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.
                  (3) Any standard steel supply item shall be deemed to be in the process of manufacture when the steel for that item is in the state of processing after the beginning of the furnace melt.
                  (f) Pending any cancellation of this contract under paragraph (e) of this clause, or if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the delivery schedule of the contract. The Contractor shall be paid for those deliveries at the contract unit price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.

                Economic price adjustment—nonstandard steel items.
                As prescribed in 216.203-4-70(b), use the following clause:
                
                  Economic Price Adjustment—Nonstandard Steel Items (JUL 1997)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Base labor index means the average of the labor indices for the three months which consist of the month of bid opening (or offer submission) and the months immediately preceding and following that month.
                  
                    Base steel index means the Contractor's established price (see note 6) including all applicable extras of $____ per _____ (see note 1) for _____ (see note 2) on the date set for bid opening (or the date of submission of the offer).
                  
                    Current labor index means the average of the labor indices for the month in which delivery of supplies is required to be made and the month preceding.
                  
                    Current steel index means the Contractor's established price (see note 6) for that item, including all applicable extras in effect ____ days (see note 3) prior to the first day of the month in which delivery is required.
                  
                    Established price is—
                  (1) A price which is an established catalog or market price of a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and
                  (2) The net price after applying any applicable standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor from its catalog, list, or schedule price. (But see Note 6.)
                  
                    Labor index means the average straight time hourly earnings of the Contractor's employees in the ____ shop of the Contractor's _____ plant (see note 4) for any particular month.
                  
                    Month means calendar month. However, if the Contractor's accounting period does not coincide with the calendar month, then that accounting period shall be used in lieu of month.
                  

                  (b) Each contract unit price shall be subject to revision, under the terms of this clause, to reflect changes in the cost of labor and steel. For purpose of this price revision, the proportion of the contract unit price attributable to costs of labor not otherwise included in the price of the steel item identified under the base steel index definition in paragraph (a) shall be ___ percent, and the proportion of the contract unit price attributable to the cost of steel shall be ___ percent. (See note 5.)
                  (c)(1) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the labor index shall be computed by dividing the total straight time earnings of the Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) for any given month by the total number of straight time hours worked by those employees in that month.

                  (2) Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the cost of labor shall be computed solely by reference to the “base labor index” and the “current labor index.”

                  (d) Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the cost of steel shall be computed solely by reference to the “base steel index” and the “current steel index.”

                  (e)(1) Each contract unit price shall be revised for each month in which delivery of supplies is required to be made.
                  
                  (2) The revised contract unit price shall apply to the deliveries of those quantities required to be made in that month regardless of when actual delivery is made.
                  (3) Each revised contract unit price shall be computed by adding—
                  (i) The adjusted cost of labor (obtained by multiplying ___ percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the current labor index and the denominator shall be the base labor index);
                  (ii) The adjusted cost of steel (obtained by multiplying ___ percent of the contract unit price by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the current steel index and the denominator shall be the base steel index); and
                  (iii) The amount equal to ___ percent of the original contract unit price (representing that portion of the unit price which relates neither to the cost of labor nor the cost of steel, and which is therefore not subject to revision (see note 5)).
                  (4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this contract shall not exceed ten percent of the original contract unit price.
                  (5) Computations shall be made to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent.
                  (f)(1) Pending any revisions of the contract unit prices, the Contractor shall be paid the contract unit price for deliveries made.
                  (2) Within 30 days after final delivery (or such other period as may be authorized by the Contracting Officer), the Contractor shall furnish a statement identifying the correctness of—

                  (i) The average straight time hourly earnings of the Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) that are relevant to the computations of the base labor index and the current labor index; and

                  (ii) The Contractor's established prices (see note 6), including all applicable extras for like quantities of the item that are relevant to the computation of the base steel index and the current steel index.
                  
                  (3) Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall make available all records used in the computation of the labor indices.
                  (4) Upon receipt of the statement, the Contracting Officer will compute the revised contract unit prices and modify the contract accordingly. No modification to this contract will be made pursuant to this clause until the Contracting Officer has verified the revised established price (see note 6).
                  (g)(1) In the event any item of this contract is subject to a total or partial termination for convenience, the month in which the Contractor receives notice of the termination, if prior to the month in which delivery is required, shall be considered the month in which delivery of the terminated item is required for the purposes of determining the current labor and steel indices under paragraphs (c) and (d).
                  (2) For any item which is not terminated for convenience, the month in which delivery is required under the contract shall continue to apply for determining those indices with respect to the quantity of the non-terminated item.
                  (3) If this contract is terminated for default, any price revision shall be limited to the quantity of the item which has been delivered by the Contractor and accepted by the Government prior to receipt by the Contractor of the notice of termination.

                  (h) If the Contractor's failure to make delivery of any required quantity arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the clause of this contract entitled “Default,” the quantity not delivered shall be delivered as promptly as possible after the cessation of the cause of the failure, and the delivery schedule set forth in this contract shall be amended accordingly.

                  (1) For increases in established wage rates or material prices, the increase in contract unit price(s) shall be effective on the same date that the government named in paragraph (a) of this clause increased the applicable wage rate(s) or material price(s), but only if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request for contract adjustment within 10 days of the change. If the Contractor's request is received later, the effective date shall be the date that the Contracting Officer received the Contractor's request.

                  Payments (DEC 1991)
                  (a) Progress payments, as used in this clause, means payments made before completion of work in progress under a job order.
                  (b) Upon submission by the Contractor of invoices in the form and number of copies directed by the Contracting Officer, and as approved by the Contracting Officer, the Government will make progress payments as work progresses under the job order.
                  (1) Generally, the Contractor may submit invoices on a semi-monthly basis, unless expenditures justify a more frequent submission.
                  (2) The Government need not make progress payments for invoices aggregating less than $5,000.
                  (3) The Contracting Officer shall approve progress payments based on the value, computed on the price of the job order, of labor and materials incorporated in the work, materials suitably stored at the site of the work, and preparatory work completed, less the aggregate of any previous payments.

                  (4) Upon request, the Contractor will furnish the Contracting Officer any reports concerning expenditures on the work to date that the Contracting Officer may require.
                  
                  (c) The Government will retain until final completion and acceptance of all work covered by the job order, an amount estimated or approved by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (b) of this clause. The amount retained will be in accordance with the rate authorized by Congress for Naval vessel repair contracts at the time of job order award.
                  (d) The Contracting Officer may direct that progress payments be based on the price of the job order as adjusted as a result of change orders under the Changes clause of the Master Agreement. If the Contracting Officer does not so direct—
                  (1) Payments of any increases shall be made from time to time after the amount of the increase is determined under the Changes clause of the Master Agreement; and
                  (2) Reductions resulting from decreases shall be made for the purposes of subsequent progress payments as soon as the amounts are determined under the Changes clause of the Master Agreement.
                  (e) Upon completion of the work under a job order and final inspection and acceptance, and upon submission of invoices in such form and with such copies as the Contracting Officer may prescribe, the Contractor shall be paid for the price of the job order, as adjusted pursuant to the Changes clause of the Master Agreement, less any performance reserves deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, and less the amount of any previous payments.
                  (f) All materials, equipment, or any other property or work in process covered by the progress payments made by the Government, upon the making of those progress payments, shall become the sole property of the Government, and are subject to the provisions of the Title clause of the Master Agreement.
                
                (End of clause)

                  Bonds (DEC 1991)
                  (a) If the solicitation requires an offeror to submit a bid bond, the Offeror may furnish, instead, an annual bid bond (or evidence thereof) or an annual performance and payment bond (or evidence thereof).
                  (b) If the solicitation does not require a bid bond, the Offeror shall not include in the price any contingency to cover the premium of such a bond.
                  (c) Even if the solicitation does not require bonds, the Contracting Officer may nevertheless require a performance and payment bond, in form, amount, and with a surety acceptable to the Contracting Officer. Where performance and payment bond is required, the offer price shall be increased upon the award of the job order in an amount not to exceed the premium of a corporate surety bond.
                  (d) If any surety upon any bond furnished in connection with a job order under this agreement fails to submit requested reports as to its financial condition or otherwise becomes unacceptable to the Government, the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to furnish whatever additional security the Contracting Officer determines necessary to protect the interests of the Government and of persons supplying labor or materials in the performance of the work contemplated under the Master Agreement.

                Default.
                As prescribed in 217.7104(a), use the following clause:
                
                  Default (DEC 1991)
                  (a) The Government may, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this clause, by written notice of default to the Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of a job order if the Contractor fails to—
                  (1) Make delivery of the supplies or to perform the services within the time specified in a job order or any extension;
                  (2) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of the job order; or
                  (3) Perform any of the other provisions of this agreement or a job order.
                  (b) Except for defaults of subcontractors, the Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if failure to perform the job order arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather.
                  (c) If the Contractor's failure to perform is caused by the default of a subcontractor, and if such default arises out of causes beyond the control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs for failure to perform, unless the supplies or services to be furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time to permit the Contractor to perform the job order within the time specified.

                  (d) If the Government terminates the job order in whole or in part as provided in paragraph (a) of this clause—
                  
                  (1) The Government may, upon such terms and in such manner as the Contracting Officer may deem appropriate, arrange for the completion of the work so terminated, at such plant or plants, including that of the Contractor, as may be designated by the Contracting Officer.
                  (i) The Contractor shall continue the performance of the job order to the extent not terminated under the provisions of this clause.
                  (ii) If the work is to be completed at the plant, the Government may use all tools, machinery, facilities, and equipment of the Contractor determined by the Contracting Office to be necessary for that purpose.
                  (iii) If the cost to the Government of the work procured or completed (after adjusting such cost to exclude the effect of changes in the plans and specifications made subsequent to the date of termination) exceeds the price fixed for work under the job order (after adjusting such price on account of changes in the plans and specifications made before the date of termination), the Contractor, or the Contractor's surety, if any, shall be liable for such excess.
                  (2) The Government, in addition to any other rights provided in this clause, may require the Contractor to transfer title and delivery to the Government, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting Officer, any completed supplies and such partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tools, dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information and contract rights (hereinafter called “manufacturing materials”) as the Contractor has specifically produced or specifically acquired for the performance of the terminated part of the job order.
                  (i) The Contractor shall, upon direction of the Contracting Officer, protect and preserve property in possession of the Contractor in which the Government has an interest.
                  (ii) The Government shall pay to the Contractor the job order price for completed items of work delivered to and accepted by the Government, and the amount agreed upon by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer for manufacturing materials delivered to and accepted by the Government, and for the protection and preservation of property. Failure to agree shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause.
                  (e) If, after notice of termination of the job order, it is determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the notice of termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government.
                  (f) If the Contractor fails to complete the performance of a job order within the time specified, or any extension, the actual damage to the Government for the delay will be difficult or impossible to determine.
                  (1) In lieu of actual damage, the Contractor shall pay to the Government as fixed, agreed, and liquidated damages for each calendar day of delay the amount, if any, set forth in the job order (prorated to the nearest hour for fractional days).
                  (2) If the Government terminates the job order, the Contractor shall be liable, in addition to the excess costs provided in paragraph (d) of this clause, for liquidated damages accruing until such time as the Government may reasonably obtain completion of the work.
                  (3) The Contractor shall not be charged with liquidated damages when the delay arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Subject to the provisions of the Disputes clause of the Master Agreement, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of the delay and shall extend the time for performance when in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, the findings of fact justify an extension.
                  (g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law under this agreement.

                  (5) Furnish suitable offices, office equipment and telephones at or near the site of the work for the Government's use.
                  (d) The job order will state whether dock and sea trials are required to determine whether or not the Contractor has satisfactorily performed the work.
                  (1) If dock and sea trials are required, the vessel shall be under the control of the vessel's commander and crew.
                  (2) The Contractor shall not conduct dock and sea trials not specified in the job order without advance approval of the Contracting Officer. Dock and sea trials not specified in the job order shall be at the Contractor's expense and risk.

                  (a) The Contractor shall exercise its best efforts to prevent accidents, injury, or damage to all employees, persons, and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part of the vessel upon which work is done.
                  (b) Loss or damage to the vessel, materials, or equipment. (1) Unless otherwise directed or approved in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not carry insurance against any form of loss or damage to the vessel(s) or to the materials or equipment to which the Government has title or which have been furnished by the Government for installation by the Contractor.

The Contractor indemnifies the Government and the vessel and its owners against all claims, demands, or causes of action to which the Government, the vessel or its owner(s) might be subject as a result of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of anyone other than the Government or its employees, or the vessel or its owner, arising in whole or in part from the negligence or other wrongful act of the Contractor or its agents or employees, or any subcontractor, or its agents or employees.

                  (iii) Payments by the Government to the Contractor under this clause are outside the scope of and shall not affect the pricing structure of the contract, and are additional to the compensation otherwise payable to the Contractor under this contract; or

                  (2) In the event the Contracting Officer decides that the loss or damage shall not be replaced or repaired, the Contracting Officer shall—
                  
                  (i) Modify the contract appropriately, consistent with the reduced requirements reflected by the unreplaced or unrepaired loss or damage; or

                  (b) If the Contractor or any subcontractor has a guarantee for work performed or materials furnished that exceeds the 90 day period, the Government shall be entitled to rely upon the longer guarantee until its expiration.
                  (c) With respect to any individual work item identified as incomplete at the time of redelivery of the vessel(s), the guarantee period shall run from the date the item is completed.

                  (1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is not practicable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel(s) to the Contractor, or the Contractor fails to proceed with the repairs promptly, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the Contractor's expense.
                  (2) If correction and repairs are performed by other than the Contractor, the Contracting Officer may discharge the Contractor's liability by making an equitable deduction in the price of the job order.
                  (e) The Contractor's liability shall extend for an additional 90 day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies that the Contractor corrected.
                  (f) At the option of the Contracting Officer, defects and deficiencies may be left uncorrected.

                  (a) A ___(insert specific type of contract action) is contemplated. The Contractor agrees to begin promptly negotiating with the Contracting Officer the terms of a definitive contract that will include (1) all clauses required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on the date of execution of the underfinitized contract action, (2) all clauses required by law on the date of execution of the definitive contract action, and (3) any other mutually agreeable clauses, terms, and conditions. The Contractor agrees to submit a ___(insert type of proposal; e.g., fixed-price or cost-and-fee) proposal and certified cost or pricing data supporting its proposal.

                  (c) If agreement on a definitive contract action to supersede this undefinitized contract action is not reached by the target date in paragraph (b) of this clause, or within any extension of it granted by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may, with the approval of the head of the contracting activity, determine a reasonable price or fee in accordance with subpart 15.4 and part 31 of the FAR, subject to Contractor appeal as provided in the Disputes clause. In any event, the Contractor shall proceed with completion of the contract, subject only to the Limitation of Government Liability clause.

Work requests shall contain data on the type of discrepancy disclosed, the specific location of the discrepancy, and the estimated labor hours and material required to correct the discrepancy.

                  (3) Verify that the proposed corrective action is appropriate; and
                  (4) Authorize over and above work as necessary.
                  (e) The Contractor shall promptly submit to the Contracting Officer, a proposal for the over and above work. The Government and Contractor will then negotiate a settlement for the over and above work. Contract modifications will be executed to definitize all over and above work.
                  (f) Failure to agree on the price of over and above work shall be a dispute within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.

                  (ii) Provide its contract number, its unique entity identifier, and the email address of the Contractor's official responsible for acknowledging or rejecting the ISR to all first-tier subcontractors, who will be required to submit ISRs, so they can enter this information into the eSRS when submitting their reports.
                  (iii) Require that each subcontractor with a subcontracting plan provide the prime contract number, its own unique entity identifier, and the email address of the subcontractor's official responsible for acknowledging or rejecting the ISRs to its subcontractors with subcontracting plans who will be required to submit ISRs.
                  (iv) Acknowledge receipt or reject all ISRs submitted by its subcontractors using eSRS.

                  (3) The Contractor shall submit SSRs using eSRS at http://www.esrs.gov. The reports shall provide information on subcontract awards to small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns. Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the prime Contractor or subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract award data reported by prime contractors and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards made to lower-tier subcontractors unless the Contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged business credit from a member firm of the Alaska Native—Corporations or an Indian tribe. Only subcontracts involving performance in the U.S. or its outlying areas should be included in these reports.
                  (i) This report may be submitted on a corporate, company, or subdivision (e.g., plant or division operating as a separate profit center) basis, as negotiated in the comprehensive subcontracting plan with the Defense Contract Management Agency.
                  (ii) This report encompasses all subcontracting under prime contracts and subcontracts with the Department of Defense, regardless of the dollar value of the subcontracts, and is based on the negotiated comprehensive subcontracting plan.
                  (iii) The report shall be submitted semiannually for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending September 30. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period.
                  (iv) The authority to acknowledge receipt of or reject the SSR resides with the Defense Contract Management Agency.
                  (e) Failure to comply. The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with the clause of this contract entitled “Utilization of Small Business Concerns,” or an approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract.
                  (f) Liquidated damages. The Contracting Officer designated to manage the comprehensive subcontracting plan will exercise the functions of the Contracting Officer, as identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this clause, on behalf of all DoD departments and agencies that awarded contracts covered by the Contractor's comprehensive subcontracting plan.
                  (1) To determine the need for liquidated damages, the Contracting Officer will conduct a compliance review during the fiscal year after the close of the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable. The Contracting Officer will compare the approved percentage or dollar goals to the total, actual subcontracting dollars covered by the plan.
                  (2) If the Contractor has failed to meet its approved subcontracting goal(s), the Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising of the potential for assessment of liquidated damages, and permitting the Contractor to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made. The Contracting Officer may take the Contractor's failure to respond to the notice within 15 working days (or longer period at the Contracting Officer's discretion) as an admission that no valid explanation exists.

                  (3) If, after consideration of all relevant information, the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the comprehensive subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor to that effect and require the Contractor to pay liquidated damages to the Government in the amount identified in the comprehensive subcontracting plan.
                  
                  (4) The Contractor shall have the right of appeal under the clause in this contract entitled “Disputes” from any final decision of the Contracting Officer.
                  (g) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include in subcontracts that offer subcontracting opportunities, are expected to exceed the applicable threshold specified in FAR 19.702(a) on the date of subcontract award, and are required to include the clause at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, the clauses at—

Accordingly, the SBA, even if not identified in Section A of this contract, is the prime contractor and retains responsibility for 8(a) certification, for 8(a) eligibility determinations and related issues, and for providing counseling and assistance to the 8(a) Contractor under the 8(a) Program. The cognizant SBA district office is:

                  (b) The contracting office is responsible for administering the contract and for taking any action on behalf of the Government under the terms and conditions of the contract; provided that the contracting office shall give advance notice to the SBA before it issues a final notice terminating performance, either in whole or in part, under the contract. The contracting office also shall coordinate with the SBA prior to processing any novation agreement. The contracting office may assign contract administration functions to a contract administration office.
                  (c) The 8(a) Contractor agrees that it will notify the Contracting Officer, simultaneous with its notification to the SBA (as required by SBA's 8(a) regulations at 13 CFR 124.515), when the owner or owners upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based plan to relinquish ownership or control of the concern. Consistent with section 407 of Public Law 100-656, transfer of ownership or control shall result in termination of the contract for convenience, unless the SBA waives the requirement for termination prior to the actual relinquishing of ownership and control.

The Contractor shall also comply with any other additional requirements included in the schedule of this contract.
                  (2) The Contractor shall allow the Government access to the Contractor's facilities, personnel, and safety program documentation. The Contractor shall allow authorized Government representatives to evaluate safety programs, implementation, and facilities.
                  (c) Noncompliance with the manual. (1) If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of any noncompliance with the manual or schedule provisions, the Contractor shall take immediate steps to correct the noncompliance. The Contractor is not entitled to reimbursement of costs incurred to correct noncompliances unless such reimbursement is specified elsewhere in the contract.
                  (2) The Contractor has 30 days from the date of notification by the Contracting Officer to correct the noncompliance and inform the Contracting Officer of the actions taken. The Contracting Officer may direct a different time period for the correction of noncompliances.
                  (3) If the Contractor refuses or fails to correct noncompliances within the time period specified by the Contracting Officer, the Government has the right to direct the Contractor to cease performance on all or part of this contract. The Contractor shall not resume performance until the Contracting Officer is satisfied that the corrective action was effective and the Contracting Officer so informs the Contractor.
                  (4) The Contracting Officer may remove Government personnel at any time the Contractor is in noncompliance with any safety requirement of this clause.
                  (5) If the direction to cease work or the removal of Government personnel results in increased costs to the Contractor, the Contractor shall not be entitled to an adjustment in the contract price or a change in the delivery or performance schedule unless the Contracting Officer later determines that the Contractor had in fact complied with the manual or schedule provisions. If the Contractor is entitled to an equitable adjustment, it shall be made in accordance with the Changes clause of this contract.
                  (d) Mishaps. If a mishap involving ammunition or explosives occurs, the Contractor shall—
                  (1) Notify the Contracting Officer immediately;

                  (3) Submit a written report to the Contracting Officer.
                  (e) Contractor responsibility for safety. (1) Nothing in this clause, nor any Government action or failure to act in surveillance of this contract, shall relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for the safety of—
                  (i) The Contractor's personnel and property;
                  (ii) The Government's personnel and property; or
                  (iii) The general public.
                  (2) Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, ordinances, codes, and regulations (including those requiring the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with the performance of this contract.
                  (f) Contractor responsibility for contract performance. (1) Neither the number or frequency of inspections performed by the Government, nor the degree of surveillance exercised by the Government, relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for contract performance.

                  (2) If the Government acts or fails to act in surveillance or enforcement of the safety requirements of this contract, this does not impose or add to any liability of the Government.
                  (g) Subcontractors. (1) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), in every subcontract that involves ammunition or explosives.
                  (i) The clause shall include a provision allowing authorized Government safety representatives to evaluate subcontractor safety programs, implementation, and facilities as the Government determines necessary.
                  (ii) Note: The Government Contracting Officer or authorized representative shall notify the prime Contractor of all findings concerning subcontractor safety and compliance with the manual. The Contracting Officer or authorized representative may furnish copies to the subcontractor. The Contractor in turn shall communicate directly with the subcontractor, substituting its name for references to “the Government”. The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors shall also include provisions to allow direction to cease performance of the subcontract if a serious uncorrected or recurring safety deficiency potentially causes an imminent hazard to DoD personnel, property, or contract performance.
                  (2) The Contractor agrees to ensure that the subcontractor complies with all contract safety requirements. The Contractor will determine the best method for verifying the adequacy of the subcontractor's compliance.
                  (3) The Contractor shall ensure that the subcontractor understands and agrees to the Government's right to access to the subcontractor's facilities, personnel, and safety program documentation to perform safety surveys. The Government performs these safety surveys of subcontractor facilities solely to prevent the occurrence of any mishap which would endanger the safety of DoD personnel or otherwise adversely impact upon the Government's contractual interests.
                  (4) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or authorized representative before issuing any subcontract when it involves ammunition or explosives. If the proposed subcontract represents a change in the place of performance, the Contractor shall request approval for such change in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Change in Place of Performance—Ammunition and Explosives”.

                As prescribed in 223.570-2, use the following clause:
                
                  Drug-Free Work Force (SEP 1988)
                  (a) Definitions. (1) Employee in a sensitive position, as used in this clause, means an employee who has been granted access to classified information; or employees in other positions that the Contractor determines involve national security, health or safety, or functions other than the foregoing requiring a high degree of trust and confidence.
                  (2) Illegal drugs, as used in this clause, means controlled substances included in Schedules I and II, as defined by section 802(6) of title 21 of the United States Code, the possession of which is unlawful under chapter 13 of that title. The term “illegal drugs” does not mean the use of a controlled substance pursuant to a valid prescription or other uses authorized by law.
                  (b) The Contractor agrees to institute and maintain a program for achieving the objective of a drug-free work force. While this clause defines criteria for such a program, contractors are encouraged to implement alternative approaches comparable to the criteria in paragraph (c) that are designed to achieve the objectives of this clause.
                  (c) Contractor programs shall include the following, or appropriate alternatives:

                  (1) Employee assistance programs emphasizing high level direction, education, counseling, rehabilitation, and coordination with available community resources;
                  
                  (2) Supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressing illegal drug use by Contractor employees;
                  (3) Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent with safety and security issues;
                  (4) Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing on a controlled and carefully monitored basis. Employee drug testing programs shall be established taking account of the following:
                  (i) The Contractor shall establish a program that provides for testing for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions. The extent of and criteria for such testing shall be determined by the Contractor based on considerations that include the nature of the work being performed under the contract, the employee's duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and the risks to health, safety, or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.
                  (ii) In addition, the Contractor may establish a program for employee drug testing—
                  (A) When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee uses illegal drugs; or
                  (B) When an employee has been involved in an accident or unsafe practice;
                  (C) As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use;
                  (D) As part of a voluntary employee drug testing program.
                  (iii) The Contractor may establish a program to test applicants for employment for illegal drug use.
                  (iv) For the purpose of administering this clause, testing for illegal drugs may be limited to those substances for which testing is prescribed by section 2.1 of subpart B of the “Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs” (53 FR 11980 (April 11 1988)), issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.
                  (d) Contractors shall adopt appropriate personnel procedures to deal with employees who are found to be using drugs illegally. Contractors shall not allow any employee to remain on duty or perform in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs until such times as the Contractor, in accordance with procedures established by the Contractor, determines that the employee may perform in such a position.
                  (e) The provisions of this clause pertaining to drug testing program shall not apply to the extent they are inconsistent with state or local law, or with an existing collective bargaining agreement; provided that with respect to the latter, the Contractor agrees that those issues that are in conflict will be a subject of negotiation at the next collective bargaining session.

A charge may be assessed for any storage or disposal authorized under any of the exceptions to 10 U.S.C. 2692. If a charge is to be assessed, then such assessment shall be identified elsewhere in the contract with payment to the Government on a reimbursable cost basis.
                  (c) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts that require, may require, or permit a subcontractor access to a DoD installation, at any subcontract tier.

                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Storage means a non-transitory, semi-permanent or permanent holding, placement, or leaving of material. It does not include a temporary accumulation of a limited quantity of a material used in or a waste generated or resulting from authorized activities, such as servicing, maintenance, or repair of Department of Defense (DoD) items, equipment, or facilities.
                  
                    Toxic or hazardous materials means—
                  (i) Materials referred to in section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601(14)) and materials designated under section 102 of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9602) (40 CFR Part 302);
                  (ii) Materials that are of an explosive, flammable, or pyrotechnic nature; or
                  (iii) Materials otherwise identified by the Secretary of Defense as specified in DoD regulations.
                  (b) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2692, the Contractor is prohibited from storing, treating, or disposing of toxic or hazardous materials not owned by DoD on a DoD installation, except to the extent authorized by a statutory exception to 10 U.S.C. 2692 or as authorized by the Secretary of Defense. A charge may be assessed for any storage or disposal authorized under any of the exceptions to 10 U.S.C. 2692. If a charge is to be assessed, then such assessment shall be identified elsewhere in the contract with payment to the Government on a reimbursable cost basis.
                  (c) With respect to treatment or disposal authorized pursuant to DFARS 223.7104(10) (10 U.S.C. 2692(b)(10), and notwithstanding any other provision of the contract, the Contractor assumes all financial and environmental responsibility and liability resulting from any treatment or disposal of toxic or hazardous materials not owned by DoD on a military installation. The Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Government harmless for all costs, liability, or penalties resulting from the Contractor's treatment or disposal of toxic or hazardous materials not owned by DoD on a military installation.
                  (d) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts that require, may require, or permit a subcontractor access to a DoD installation, at any tier. Inclusion of the substance of this clause in subcontracts does not relieve the prime Contractor of liability to the Government under paragraph (c) of this clause.

                  (A) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial item” in section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation);
                  (B) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
                  (C) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and
                  (ii) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.

                  (i) A satisfactory quality;
                  (ii) A sufficient quantity; and
                  (iii) The required form.

                  (6) End items containing a minimal amount of otherwise noncompliant specialty metals (i.e., specialty metals not melted or produced in the United States, an outlying area, or a qualifying country, that are not covered by one of the other exceptions in this paragraph (c)), if the total weight of such noncompliant metals does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of all specialty metals in the end item, as estimated in good faith by the Contractor. This exception does not apply to high performance magnets containing specialty metals.
                  (d) Compliance for commercial derivative military articles. (1) As an alternative to the compliance required in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor may purchase an amount of domestically melted or produced specialty metals in the required form, for use during the period of contract performance in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, if—
                  (i) The Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor of the items to be delivered under this contract that have been determined by the Government to meet the definition of “commercial derivative military article”; and

                  (ii) For each item that has been determined by the Government to meet the definition of “commercial derivative military article,” the Contractor has certified, as specified in the provision of the solicitation entitled “Commercial Derivative Military Article—Specialty Metals Compliance Certificate” (DFARS 252.225-7010), that the Contractor and its subcontractor(s) will enter into a contractual agreement or agreements to purchase an amount of domestically melted or produced specialty metal in the required form, for use during the period of contract performance in the production of each commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article, that is not less than the Contractor's good faith estimate of the greater of—
                  (A) An amount equivalent to 120 percent of the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the production of the commercial derivative military article (including the work performed under each subcontract); or
                  (B) An amount equivalent to 50 percent of the amount of specialty metal that will be purchased by the Contractor and its subcontractors for use during such period in the production of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial article.
                  (2) For the purposes of this alternative, the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out production of the commercial derivative military article includes specialty metal contained in any item, including COTS items.
                  (e) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor shall exclude and reserve paragraph (d) and this paragraph (e)(1) when flowing down this clause to subcontracts.
                  (2) The Contractor shall insert paragraphs (a) through (c) and this paragraph (e)(2) of this clause in subcontracts, including subcontracts for commercial items, that are for items containing specialty metals to ensure compliance of the end products that the Contractor will deliver to the Government. When inserting this clause in subcontracts, the Contractor shall—
                  (i) Modify paragraph (c)(6) of this clause only as necessary to facilitate management of the minimal content exception at the prime contract level. The minimal content exception does not apply to specialty metals contained in high-performance magnets; and
                  (ii) Not further alter the clause other than to identify the appropriate parties.

                    Bahrainian end product means an article that—
                  (i) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Bahrain; or

                  (A) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial item” in section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation);
                  (B) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
                  (C) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and

Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic.

                  (2) It is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American statute; or

                  (i) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Panama; or

                  (ii) Applicable laws and regulations of the United States and the host country and applicable treaties and international agreements regarding performance of private security functions;
                  (iii) Orders, directives, and instructions issued by the applicable Combatant Commander or relevant Chief of Mission relating to weapons, equipment, force protection, security, health, safety, or relations and interaction with locals; and
                  (iv) Rules on the use of force issued by the applicable Combatant Commander or relevant Chief of Mission for personnel performing private security functions;
                  (3) Provide full cooperation with any Government-authorized investigation of incidents reported pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this clause and incidents of alleged misconduct by personnel performing private security functions under this contract by providing—
                  (i) Access to employees performing private security functions; and
                  (ii) Relevant information in the possession of the Contractor regarding the incident concerned; and

                252.225-7040
                Contractor Personnel Supporting U.S. Armed Forces Deployed Outside the United States.
                As prescribed in 225.371-5(a), use the following clause:
                
                  Contractor Personnel Supporting U.S. Armed Forces Deployed Outside the United States (OCT 2015)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Combatant Commander means the commander of a unified or specified combatant command established in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 161.
                  
                    Contractors authorized to accompany the Force, or CAAF, means contractor personnel, including all tiers of subcontractor personnel, who are authorized to accompany U.S. Armed Forces in applicable operations and have been afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. CAAF generally include all U.S. citizen and third-country national employees not normally residing within the operational area whose area of performance is in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces and who routinely are collocated with the U.S. Armed Forces (especially in non-permissive environments). Personnel collocated with U.S. Armed Forces shall be afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. In some cases, Combatant Commander subordinate commanders may designate mission-essential host nation or local national contractor employees (e.g., interpreters) as CAAF. CAAF includes contractors previously identified as contractors deploying with the U.S. Armed Forces. CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.
                  
                    Designated operational area means a geographic area designated by the combatant commander or subordinate joint force commander for the conduct or support of specified military operations.
                  
                    Designated reception site means the designated place for the reception, staging, integration, and onward movement of contractors deploying during a contingency. The designated reception site includes assigned joint reception centers and other Service or private reception sites.
                  
                    Law of war means that part of international law that regulates the conduct of armed hostilities. The law of war encompasses all international law for the conduct of hostilities binding on the United States or its individual citizens, including treaties and international agreements to which the United States is a party, and applicable customary international law.
                  
                    Non-CAAF means personnel who are not designated as CAAF, such as local national (LN) employees and non-LN employees who are permanent residents in the operational area or third-country nationals not routinely residing with U.S. Armed Forces (and third-country national expatriates who are permanent residents in the operational area) who perform support functions away from the close proximity of, and do not reside with, U.S. Armed Forces. Government-furnished support to non-CAAF is typically limited to force protection, emergency medical care, and basic human needs (e.g., bottled water, latrine facilities, security, and food when necessary) when performing their jobs in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces. Non-CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.
                  
                    Subordinate joint force commander means a sub-unified commander or joint task force commander.
                  (b) General. (1) This clause applies to both CAAF and non-CAAF when performing in a designated operational area outside the United States to support U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States in—
                  (i) Contingency operations;
                  (ii) Peace operations, consistent with Joint Publication 3-07.3; or
                  (iii) Other military operations or military exercises, when designated by the Combatant Commander or as directed by the Secretary of Defense.
                  (2) Contract performance in support of U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States may require work in dangerous or austere conditions. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor accepts the risks associated with required contract performance in such operations.
                  (3) When authorized in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause to carry arms for personal protection, Contractor personnel are only authorized to use force for individual self-defense.
                  (4) Unless immune from host nation jurisdiction by virtue of an international agreement or international law, inappropriate use of force by contractor personnel supporting the U.S. Armed Forces can subject such personnel to United States or host nation prosecution and civil liability (see paragraphs (d) and (j)(3) of this clause).
                  (5) Service performed by Contractor personnel subject to this clause is not active duty or service under 38 U.S.C. 106 note.
                  (c) Support. (1)(i) The Combatant Commander will develop a security plan for protection of Contractor personnel in locations where there is not sufficient or legitimate civil authority, when the Combatant Commander decides it is in the interests of the Government to provide security because—
                  (A) The Contractor cannot obtain effective security services;
                  (B) Effective security services are unavailable at a reasonable cost; or
                  (C) Threat conditions necessitate security through military means.
                  (ii) In appropriate cases, the Combatant Commander may provide security through military means, commensurate with the level of security provided DoD civilians.
                  (2)(i) Generally, CAAF will be afforded emergency medical and dental care if injured while supporting applicable operations. Additionally, non-CAAF employees who are injured while in the vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces will normally receive emergency medical and dental care. Emergency medical and dental care includes medical care situations in which life, limb, or eyesight is jeopardized. Examples of emergency medical and dental care include examination and initial treatment of victims of sexual assault; refills of prescriptions for life-dependent drugs; repair of broken bones, lacerations, infections; and traumatic injuries to the dentition. Hospitalization will be limited to stabilization and short-term medical treatment with an emphasis on return to duty or placement in the patient movement system.

                  (ii) When the Government provides medical treatment or transportation of Contractor personnel to a selected civilian facility, the Contractor shall ensure that the Government is reimbursed for any costs associated with such treatment or transportation.
                  
                  (iii) Medical or dental care beyond this standard is not authorized.
                  (3) Contractor personnel must have a Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT)-generated letter of authorization signed by the Contracting Officer in order to process through a deployment center or to travel to, from, or within the designated operational area. The letter of authorization also will identify any additional authorizations, privileges, or Government support that Contractor personnel are entitled to under this contract. Contractor personnel who are issued a letter of authorization shall carry it with them at all times while deployed.
                  (4) Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, the Contractor is responsible for all other support required for its personnel engaged in the designated operational area under this contract.
                  (d) Compliance with laws and regulations. (1) The Contractor shall comply with, and shall ensure that its personnel supporting U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause are familiar with and comply with, all applicable—
                  (i) United States, host country, and third country national laws;
                  (ii) Provisions of the law of war, as well as any other applicable treaties and international agreements;
                  (iii) United States regulations, directives, instructions, policies, and procedures; and
                  (iv) Orders, directives, and instructions issued by the Combatant Commander, including those relating to force protection, security, health, safety, or relations and interaction with local nationals.
                  (2) The Contractor shall institute and implement an effective program to prevent violations of the law of war by its employees and subcontractors, including law of war training in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this clause.
                  (3) The Contractor shall ensure that CAAF and non-CAAF are aware—
                  (i) Of the DoD definition of “sexual assault” in DoDD Directive 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program;
                  (ii) That many of the offenses addressed by the definition are covered under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (see paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this clause). Other sexual misconduct may constitute offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Federal law, such as the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, or host nation laws;
                  (iii) That the offenses not covered by the Uniform Code of Military Justice may nevertheless have consequences to the contractor employees (see paragraph (h)(1) of this clause).
                  (4) The Contractor shall report to the appropriate investigative authorities, identified in paragraph (d)(6) of this clause, any alleged offenses under—
                  (i) The Uniform Code of Military Justice (chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code) (applicable to contractors serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field during a declared war or contingency operations); or
                  (ii) The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (chapter 212 of title 18, United States Code).
                  (5) The Contractor shall provide to all contractor personnel who will perform work on a contract in the deployed area, before beginning such work, information on the following:
                  (i) How and where to report an alleged crime described in paragraph (d)(4) of this clause.
                  (ii) Where to seek victim and witness protection and assistance available to contractor personnel in connection with an alleged offense described in paragraph (d)(4) of this clause.
                  (iii) That this section does not create any rights or privileges that are not authorized by law or DoD policy.
                  (6) The appropriate investigative authorities to which suspected crimes shall be reported include the following—

                  (8)(i) The Contractor shall ensure that Contractor employees supporting the U.S. Armed Forces are aware of their rights to—
                  (A) Hold their own identity or immigration documents, such as passport or driver's license, regardless of the documents' issuing authority;

                  (h) Contractor personnel. (1) The Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor, at its own expense, to remove and replace any Contractor personnel who jeopardize or interfere with mission accomplishment or who fail to comply with or violate applicable requirements of this contract. Such action may be taken at the Government's discretion without prejudice to its rights under any other provision of this contract, including the Termination for Default clause.
                  (2) The Contractor shall identify all personnel who occupy a position designated as mission essential and ensure the continuity of essential Contractor services during designated operations, unless, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's representative, or local commander, the Contracting Officer directs withdrawal due to security conditions.
                  (3) The Contractor shall ensure that Contractor personnel follow the guidance at paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this clause and any specific Combatant Commander guidance on reporting offenses alleged to have been committed by or against Contractor personnel to appropriate investigative authorities.
                  (4) Contractor personnel shall return all U.S. Government-issued identification, to include the Common Access Card, to appropriate U.S. Government authorities at the end of their deployment (or, for non-CAAF, at the end of their employment under this contract).
                  (i) Military clothing and protective equipment. (1) Contractor personnel are prohibited from wearing military clothing unless specifically authorized in writing by the Combatant Commander. If authorized to wear military clothing, Contractor personnel must—

                  (ii) Carry the written authorization with them at all times.
                  (2) Contractor personnel may wear military-unique organizational clothing and individual equipment (OCIE) required for safety and security, such as ballistic, nuclear, biological, or chemical protective equipment.
                  (3) The deployment center, or the Combatant Commander, shall issue OCIE and shall provide training, if necessary, to ensure the safety and security of Contractor personnel.
                  (4) The Contractor shall ensure that all issued OCIE is returned to the point of issue, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer.
                  (j) Weapons.

                  (i) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is—
                  (A) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial item” in section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation);
                  (B) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
                  (C) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and
                  (ii) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.

The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material.
                  
                    Cost of components means—
                  (i) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or

                    Domestic construction material means—
                  (i) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or
                  (ii) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if—
                  (A) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which nonavailability determinations have been made are treated as domestic; or
                  (B) The construction material is a COTS item.
                  
                    United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.
                  (b) Domestic preference. This clause implements the Balance of Payments Program by providing a preference for domestic construction material. The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except for—
                  (1) Construction material valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold in part 2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation;
                  (2) Information technology that is a commercial item; or

As prescribed in 225.7503(a) and (a)(2), use the following clause, which adds definitions for South Caucasus/Central and South Asian (SC/CASA) state and SC/CASA state construction material to paragraph (a), and uses “domestic construction material or SC/CASA state construction material” instead of “domestic construction material” in the second sentence of paragraph (b):

                    South Caucasus/Central and South Asian (SC/CASA) state means Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, or Uzbekistan.
                  
                    SC/CASA state construction material means construction material that—

                252.227-7013
                Rights in technical data—Noncommercial items.
                As prescribed in 227.7103-6(a), use the following clause:
                
                  Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items (FEB 2014)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  (1) Computer data base means a collection of data recorded in a form capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include computer software.
                  (2) Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.
                  (3) Computer software means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled. Computer software does not include computer data bases or computer software documentation.
                  (4) Computer software documentation means owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.
                  (5) Covered Government support contractor means a contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014)under a contract, the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), provided that the contractor—
                  (i) Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and
                  (ii) Receives access to technical data or computer software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
                  (6) Detailed manufacturing or process data means technical data that describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.
                  (7) Developed means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.
                  (8) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.
                  (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.
                  (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.
                  (9) Developed exclusively with government funds means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
                  (10) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.
                  (11) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.
                  (12) Government purpose means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.
                  (13) Government purpose rights means the rights to—
                  (i) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data within the Government without restriction; and
                  (ii) Release or disclose technical data outside the Government and authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for United States government purposes.
                  (14) Limited rights means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—
                  (i) The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—
                  (A) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
                  (B) A release or disclosure to—
                  (1) A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contract for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or
                  (2) A foreign government, of technical data other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use of such data by the foreign government is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;
                  (ii) The recipient of the technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and
                  (iii) The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.
                  (15) Technical data means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation). The term does not include computer software or data incidental to contract administration, such as financial and/or management information.
                  (16) Unlimited rights means rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose technical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so.
                  (b) Rights in technical data. The Contractor grants or shall obtain for the Government the following royalty free, world-wide, nonexclusive, irrevocable license rights in technical data other than computer software documentation (see the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract for rights in computer software documentation):
                  (1) Unlimited rights. The Government shall have unlimited rights in technical data that are—
                  (i) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;
                  (ii) Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced for this contract, when the study, analysis, test, or similar work was specified as an element of performance;
                  (iii) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;
                  (iv) Form, fit, and function data;
                  (v) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);
                  (vi) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the Contractor by the Government;
                  (vii) Otherwise publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the Contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure, other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;
                  (viii) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or
                  (ix) Data furnished to the Government, under this or any other Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—
                  (A) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or
                  (B) Government purpose rights and the Contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.
                  (2) Government purpose rights. (i) The Government shall have government purpose rights for a five-year period, or such other period as may be negotiated, in technical data—
                  (A) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights in such data as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iv) through (b)(1)(ix) of this clause; or
                  (B) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
                  (ii) The five-year period, or such other period as may have been negotiated, shall commence upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the items, components, or processes or creation of the data described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this clause. Upon expiration of the five-year or other negotiated period, the Government shall have unlimited rights in the technical data.
                  (iii) The Government shall not release or disclose technical data in which it has government purpose rights unless—
                  (A) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); or
                  (B) The recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
                  (iv) The Contractor has the exclusive right, including the right to license others, to use technical data in which the Government has obtained government purpose rights under this contract for any commercial purpose during the time period specified in the government purpose rights legend prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of this clause.
                  (3) Limited rights. (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iv) through (b)(1)(ix) of this clause, the Government shall have limited rights in technical data—
                  (A) Pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense and marked with the limited rights legend prescribed in paragraph (f) of this clause; or
                  (B) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.
                  (ii) The Government shall require a recipient of limited rights data for emergency repair or overhaul to destroy the data and all copies in its possession promptly following completion of the emergency repair/overhaul and to notify the Contractor that the data have been destroyed.

                  (iii) The Contractor, its subcontractors, and suppliers are not required to provide the Government additional rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data furnished to the Government with limited rights. However, if the Government desires to obtain additional rights in technical data in which it has limited rights, the Contractor agrees to promptly enter into negotiations with the Contracting Officer to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. All technical data in which the Contractor has granted the Government additional rights shall be listed or described in a license agreement made part of the contract. The license shall enumerate the additional rights granted the Government in such data.
                  (iv) The Contractor acknowledges that—
                  (A) Limited rights data are authorized to be released or disclosed to covered Government support contractors;
                  (B) The Contractor will be notified of such release or disclosure;
                  (C) The Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions as identified in the limited rights legend) may require each such covered Government support contractor to enter into a non-disclosure agreement directly with the Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions) regarding the covered Government support contractor's use of such data, or alternatively, that the Contractor (or party asserting restrictions) may waive in writing the requirement for a non-disclosure agreement; and
                  (D) Any such non-disclosure agreement shall address the restrictions on the covered Government support contractor's use of the limited rights data as set forth in the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends. The non-disclosure agreement shall not include any additional terms and conditions unless mutually agreed to by the parties to the non-disclosure agreement.
                  (4) Specifically negotiated license rights. The standard license rights granted to the Government under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this clause, including the period during which the Government shall have government purpose rights in technical data, may be modified by mutual agreement to provide such rights as the parties consider appropriate but shall not provide the Government lesser rights than are enumerated in paragraph (a)(14) of this clause. Any rights so negotiated shall be identified in a license agreement made part of this contract.
                  (5) Prior government rights. Technical data that will be delivered, furnished, or otherwise provided to the Government under this contract, in which the Government has previously obtained rights shall be delivered, furnished, or provided with the pre-existing rights, unless—
                  (i) The parties have agreed otherwise; or
                  (ii) Any restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the data have expired or no longer apply.
                  (6) Release from liability. The Contractor agrees to release the Government from liability for any release or disclosure of technical data made in accordance with paragraph (a)(14) or (b)(2)(iii) of this clause, in accordance with the terms of a license negotiated under paragraph (b)(4) of this clause, or by others to whom the recipient has released or disclosed the data and to seek relief solely from the party who has improperly used, modified, reproduced, released, performed, displayed, or disclosed Contractor data marked with restrictive legends.
                  (c) Contractor rights in technical data. All rights not granted to the Government are retained by the Contractor.
                  (d) Third party copyrighted data. The Contractor shall not, without the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any copyrighted data in the technical data to be delivered under this contract unless the Contractor is the copyright owner or has obtained for the Government the license rights necessary to perfect a license or licenses in the deliverable data of the appropriate scope set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause, and has affixed a statement of the license or licenses obtained on behalf of the Government and other persons to the data transmittal document.
                  (e) Identification and delivery of data to be furnished with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure. (1) This paragraph does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.
                  (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, technical data that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure are identified in an attachment to this contract (the Attachment). The Contractor shall not deliver any data with restrictive markings unless the data are listed on the Attachment.
                  (3) In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other assertions may be identified after award when based on new information or inadvertent omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have materially affected the source selection decision. Such identification and assertion shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer as soon as practicable prior to the scheduled date for delivery of the data, in the following format, and signed by an official authorized to contractually obligate the Contractor: Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data.
                  The Contractor asserts for itself, or the persons identified below, that the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose the following technical data should be restricted—
                  
                    
                      Technical data to be furnished with restrictions 1
                      
                      Basis for assertion 2
                      
                      Asserted rights category 3
                      
                      Name of person asserting restrictions 4

                      1 If the assertion is applicable to items, components or processes developed at private expense, identify both the data and each such item, component, or process.
                    
                    
                      2 Generally, the development of an item, component, or process at private expense, either exclusively or partially, is the only basis for asserting restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose technical data pertaining to such items, components, or processes. Indicate whether development was exclusively or partially at private expense. If development was not at private expense, enter the specific reason for asserting that the Government's rights should be restricted.
                    
                      3 Enter asserted rights category (e.g., government purpose license rights from a prior contract, rights in SBIR data generated under another contract, limited or government purpose rights under this or a prior contract, or specifically negotiated licenses).
                    
                      4 Corporation, individual, or other person, as appropriate.

                (End of identification and assertion)
                
                  (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract.
                  (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
                  (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all technical data that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. Reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.
                  (2) Government purpose rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:
                  Government Purpose Rights

                  Contractor Address
                  
                  
                  
                  Expiration Date
                  The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply after the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.
                
                (End of legend)
                
                  (3) Limited rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with limited rights shall be marked with the following legend:

                  Contractor Name
                  
                  Contractor Address
                  
                  
                  The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named Contractor.
                
                (End of legend)
                
                  (4) Special license rights markings. (i) Data in which the Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend:
                  Special License Rights

                  The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these data are restricted by Contract No. ________ (Insert contract number) ________, License No. ________ (Insert license identifier) ________. Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.
                
                (End of legend)
                
                  (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(5) of this clause).
                  (5) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data deliverable under this contract, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.
                  (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, shall—
                  (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and
                  (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data delivered under this contract.
                  (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings—(1) Unjustified technical data markings. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the procedures in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.
                  (2) Nonconforming technical data markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such marking within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming marking.
                  (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.
                  (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data to be delivered under this contract when—
                  (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data; or
                  (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
                  (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause—
                  (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and
                  (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will be delivered.
                  (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) The Contractor shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.
                  (2) Whenever any technical data for noncommercial items, or for commercial items developed in any part at Government expense, is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, including subcontracts or other contractual instruments for commercial items, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. This clause will govern the technical data pertaining to noncommercial items or to any portion of a commercial item that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher-tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data.

                  (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
                  (4) The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.
                  (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligations to the Government.

                  (2) The Government shall not publish a deliverable technical data item or items identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause or authorize others to publish such data on its behalf if, prior to publication for sale by the Government and within twenty-four (24) months following the date specified in this contract for delivery of such data or the removal of any national security or export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication shall include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in the published data.
                  (3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale shall continue as long as the data are reasonably available to the public for purchase.

                  (c) Rights in derivative computer software or computer software documentation. The Government shall retain its rights in the unchanged portions of any computer software or computer software documentation delivered under this contract that the Contractor uses to prepare, or includes in, derivative computer software or computer software documentation.
                  (d) Third party copyrighted computer software or computer software documentation. The Contractor shall not, without the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any copyrighted computer software or computer software documentation in the software or documentation to be delivered under this contract unless the Contractor is the copyright owner or has obtained for the Government the license rights necessary to perfect a license or licenses in the deliverable software or documentation of the appropriate scope set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause, and prior to delivery of such—
                  (1) Computer software, has provided a statement of the license rights obtained in a form acceptable to the Contracting Officer; or
                  (2) Computer software documentation, has affixed to the transmittal document a statement of the license rights obtained.
                  (e) Identification and delivery of computer software and computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure. (1) This paragraph does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright.
                  (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, computer software that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure is identified in an attachment to this contract (the Attachment). The Contractor shall not deliver any software with restrictive markings unless the software is listed on the Attachment.
                  (3) In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other assertions may be identified after award when based on new information or inadvertent omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have materially affected the source selection decision. Such identification and assertion shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer as soon as practicable prior to the scheduled data for delivery of the software, in the following format, and signed by an official authorized to contractually obligate the Contractor: Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Computer Software.
                  The Contractor asserts for itself, or the persons identified below, that the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose the following computer software should be restricted:

                  (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software by marking the deliverable software or documentation subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract; the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
                  (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmitted document or software storage container and each page, or portions thereof, of printed material containing computer software for which restrictions are asserted. Computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of computer software or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.
                  (2) Government purpose rights markings. Computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:

                (End of legend)
                
                  (4) Special license rights markings. (i) Computer software or computer documentation in which the Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend:
                  Special License Rights
                  The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by Contract No. ____(Insert contract number)____, License No.____(Insert license identifier)____.

                  (5) Pre-existing markings. If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such software or documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the software qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.
                  (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, shall—
                  (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and
                  (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on computer software or computer software documentation delivered under this contract.
                  (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings—(1) Unjustified computer software or computer software documentation markings. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on computer software or computer software documentation furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software and the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.
                  (2) Nonconforming computer software or computer software documentation markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software or the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.
                  (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.
                  (j) Limitation on charges for rights in computer software or computer software documentation. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under this contract when—
                  (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the software or documentation; or
                  (ii) The software or documentation are available to the public without restrictions.
                  (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause—
                  (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier computer software or computer software documentation, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and
                  (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the software or documentation will be delivered.
                  (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) Whenever any noncommercial computer software or computer software documentation is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in its subcontracts or other contractual instruments, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's computer software or computer software documentation.
                  (2) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in computer software or computer software documentation from their subcontractors or suppliers.
                  (3) The Contractor shall ensure that subcontractor or supplier rights are recognized and protected in the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause.
                  (4) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in computer software or computer software documentation as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

                  (2) The Government shall not publish a deliverable item or items of computer software or computer software documentation identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause or authorize others to publish such software or documentation on its behalf if, prior to publication for sale by the Government and within twenty-four (24) months following the date specified in this contract for delivery of such software or documentation, or the removal of any national security or export control restrictions, whichever is later, the Contractor publishes that item or items for sale and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication shall include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in the published software or documentation.

                  (3) This limitation on the Government's rights to publish for sale shall continue as long as the software or documentation are reasonably available to the public for purchase.

                  (i) Technical data covered by paragraph (b)(2) of this clause are authorized to be released or disclosed to covered Government support contractors;
                  (ii) The Contractor will be notified of such release or disclosure;

                  (iii) The Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions as identified in a restrictive legend) may require each such covered Government support contractor to enter into a non-disclosure agreement directly with the Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions) regarding the covered Government support contractor's use of such data, or alternatively, that the Contractor (or party asserting restrictions) may waive in writing the requirement for an non-disclosure agreement; and

                  (iv) Any such non-disclosure agreement shall address the restrictions on the covered Government support contractor's use of the data as set forth in the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.

                Rights in noncommercial technical data and computer software—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program.
                As prescribed in 227.7104(a), use the following clause:
                
                  Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program (FEB 2014)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  (1) Commercial computer software means software developed or regularly used for nongovernmental purposes which—
                  (i) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the public;
                  (ii) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the public;
                  (iii) Has not been offered, sold, leased, or licensed to the public but will be available for commercial sale, lease, or license in time to satisfy the delivery requirements of this contract; or
                  (iv) Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this clause and would require only minor modification to meet the requirements of this contract.
                  (2) Computer database means a collection of recorded data in a form capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include computer software.
                  (3) Computer program means a set of instructions, rules, or routines, recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.
                  (4) Computer software means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, re-created, or recompiled. Computer software does not include computer databases or computer software documentation.
                  (5) Computer software documentation means owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.
                  
                  (6) Covered Government support contractor means a contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014) under a contract, the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), provided that the contractor—
                  (i) Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and
                  (ii) Receives access to the technical data or computer software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.
                  (7) Detailed manufacturing or process data means technical data that describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.
                  (8) Developed means—
                  (i) (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.) An item, component, or process, exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code;
                  (ii) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;
                  (iii) Computer software, other than computer programs, has been tested or analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose; or
                  (iv) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to comply with requirements under that contract.
                  (9) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.
                  (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.
                  (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.
                  (10) Developed exclusively with government funds means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.
                  (11) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.
                  (12) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that describe the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.
                  (13) Generated means technical data or computer software first created in the performance of this contract.
                  (14) Government purpose means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.

                  (15) “Limited rights” means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—
                  
                  (i) The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—
                  (A) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or
                  (B) A release or disclosure to—
                  (1) A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contracts for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or

                  (ii) The recipient of the technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and
                  (iii) The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.
                  (16) Minor modification means a modification that does not significantly alter the nongovernmental function or purpose of computer software or is of the type customarily provided in the commercial marketplace.
                  (17) Noncommercial computer software means software that does not qualify as commercial computer software under paragraph (a)(1) of this clause.
                  (18) “Restricted rights” apply only to noncommercial computer software and mean the Government's rights to—
                  (i) Use a computer program with one computer at one time. The program may not be accessed by more than one terminal or central processing unit or time shared unless otherwise permitted by this contract;
                  (ii) Transfer a computer program to another Government agency without the further permission of the Contractor if the transferor destroys all copies of the program and related computer software documentation in its possession and notifies the licensor of the transfer.

                  (v) Permit contractors or subcontractors performing service contracts (see 37.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) in support of this or a related contract to use computer software to diagnose and correct deficiencies in a computer program, to modify computer software to enable a computer program to be combined with, adapted to, or merged with other computer programs or when necessary to respond to urgent tactical situations, provided that—
                  (A) The Government notifies the party which has granted restricted rights that a release or disclosure to particular contractors or subcontractors was made;
                  (B) Such contractors or subcontractors are subject to the non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement or are Government contractors receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;
                  (C) The Government shall not permit the recipient to decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the software, or use software decompiled, disassembled, or reverse engineered by the Government pursuant to paragraph (a)(18)(iv) of this clause, for any other purpose; and
                  (D) Such use is subject to the limitations in paragraphs (a)(18)(i) through (iii) of this clause;
                  (vi) Permit contractors or subcontractors performing emergency repairs or overhaul of items or components of items procured under this or a related contract to use the computer software when necessary to perform the repairs or overhaul, or to modify the computer software to reflect the repairs or overhaul made, provided that—
                  (A) The intended recipient is subject to the non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 or is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;

                  (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertions, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software and/or Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clauses of this contract.
                  (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data or software subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this clause, only the following markings are authorized under this contract: the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause, the SBIR data rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause, or the special license rights legend at paragraphs (f)(5) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.
                  (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data or computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.
                  (2) Limited rights markings. Technical data not generated under this contract that pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense and delivered or otherwise furnished with limited rights shall be marked with the following legend:
                  Limited Rights
                  Contract No.
                  
                  Contractor Name
                  
                  Contractor Address
                  
                  
                  
                  The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named Contractor.
                
                (End of legend)
                
                  (3) Restricted rights markings. Computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with restricted rights shall be marked with the following legend:
                  Restricted Rights
                  Contract No.
                  
                  Contractor Name
                  
                  Contractor Address
                  
                  
                  
                  The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of computer software or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named Contractor.
                
                (End of legend)
                
                  (4) SBIR data rights markings: Except for technical data or computer software in which the Government has acquired unlimited rights under paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, or negotiated special license rights as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this clause, technical data or computer software generated under this contract shall be marked with the following legend. The Contractor shall enter the expiration date for the SBIR data rights period on the legend:
                  SBIR Data Rights
                  Contract No.
                  
                  Contractor Name
                  
                  Address
                  
                  
                  
                  Expiration of SBIR Data Rights Period
                  
                  The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software marked with this legend are restricted during the period shown as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program clause contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply after the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical data, computer software, or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.
                
                (End of legend)
                
                  (5) Special license rights markings. (i) Technical data or computer software in which the Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend:
                  Special License Rights
                  The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this technical data or computer software are restricted by Contract No. ________ (Insert contract number) ________, License No. ________ (Insert license identifier) ________. Any reproduction of technical data, computer software, or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.
                
                (End of legend)
                
                  (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(6) of this clause).
                  (6) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.
                  (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data or computer software with other than unlimited rights, shall—
                  (1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and
                  (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data or computer software delivered under this contract.
                  (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings—(1) Unjustified markings. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data or computer software furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data and the Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.
                  (2) Nonconforming markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (6)) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.
                  (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.
                  (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer software. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract when—
                  
                  (i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data or software; or
                  (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.
                  (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause—
                  (i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and
                  (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or computer software will be delivered.
                  (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) the Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.
                  (2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data—Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.
                  (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
                  (4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.
                  (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

                  Alternate I (JUN 1995). As prescribed in 227.7104(d), add the following paragraph (l) to the basic clause:
                
                
                  (l) Publication for sale. (1) This paragraph applies only to technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with SBIR data rights.
                  (2) Upon expiration of the SBIR data rights period, the Government will not exercise its right to publish or authorize others to publish an item of technical data or computer software identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause if the Contractor, prior to the expiration of the SBIR data rights period, or within two years following delivery of the data or software item, or within twenty-four months following the removal of any national security or export control restrictions, whichever is later, publishes such data or software item(s) and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication(s) shall include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in the published data.
                  (3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale shall continue as long as the technical data or computer software are reasonably available to the public for purchase.
                
                [60 FR 33499, June 28, 1995, as amended at 60 FR 61602, Nov. 30, 1995; 76 FR 3538, Jan. 20, 2011; 76 FR 11369, Mar. 2, 2011; 78 FR 30239, May 22, 2013; 79 FR 11341, Feb. 28, 2014]
              
              
                252.227-7019
                Validation of asserted restrictions—Computer software.
                As prescribed in 227.7104(e)(3) or 227.7203-6(c), use the following clause:
                
                  Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software (SEP 2016)
                  (a) Definitions. (1) As used in this clause, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “Contractor” means the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers.
                  (2) Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract.
                  (b) Justification. The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d) or a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.
                  (c) Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at any tier who assert restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software. Neither this clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.
                  (d) Requests for information. (1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.
                  (2) Based upon the information provided, if the—
                  (i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the Contracting Officer may—
                  (A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or
                  (B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike the unjustified restrictions and return the corrected software to the Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software, the Contracting Officer may correct the strike the markings at the Contractor's expense.
                  (ii) Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify the Contractor in writing.
                  (3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a Contracting Officer's request for information or failure to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.
                  (e) Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions. (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government, or three years following final payment under this contract, whichever is later.
                  (2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation under this clause. Only a Contracting Officer's final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.
                  (f) Challenge procedures. (1) A challenge must be in writing and shall—
                  (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;
                  (ii) Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days;
                  (iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the assertion based upon records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available to the Contractor, in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and
                  (iv) State that a Contracting Officer's final decision, during the three-year period preceding this challenge, or action of a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the validity of an identical assertion made by the Contractor (or a licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.
                  (2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response if the Contractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
                  (3) The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting documentation if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor's explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor agrees to promptly respond to the Contracting Officer's request for additional supporting documentation.
                  (4) Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any time prior to a Contracting Officer's final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.

                  (5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information or additional information under paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.
                  (6) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing any available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has—
                  (i) Not been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction; or
                  (ii) Been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, validating the asserted restriction.
                  (7) A Contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted restriction(s) from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer who initiated the first in time unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other Contracting Officers who have challenged the restrictions and the Contractor, shall formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a reasonable opportunity for responding to each challenge.
                  (g) Contractor appeal—Government obligation. (1) The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restriction—
                  (i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision to allow the Contractor to appeal to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an appropriate court;
                  (ii) For a period of one year from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90) days following the Contracting Officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided notice of an intent to file suit in an appropriate court; or
                  (iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has: (A) appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit an appropriate court within ninety (90) days; or (B) submitted, within ninety (90) days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed suit within one year.
                  (2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor fails to—
                  (i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision;
                  (ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from such date; or
                  (iii) File suit within one year after the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided notice of intent to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision.
                  (3) The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling circumstances. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) government purpose legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do so; or (ii) restricted or special license rights for government purposes only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), or is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends. The agency head's determination may be made at any time after the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against the United States, or other relief provided by law, if its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld.

                  (ii) The Contractor will take all reasonable steps to protect the technical data or computer software against any unauthorized release or disclosure;
                  (iii) The Contractor will ensure that the party whose name appears in the legend is notified of the access or use within thirty (30) days of the Contractor's access or use of such data or software;

                  (2) That the party whose name appears on the restrictive legend, in addition to any other rights it may have, is a third party beneficiary who has the right of direct action against the Contractor, or any person to whom the Contractor has released or disclosed such data or software, for the unauthorized duplication, release, or disclosure of technical data or computer software subject to restrictive legends.
                  (d) The Contractor shall ensure that its employees are subject to use and non-disclosure obligations consistent with this clause prior to the employees being provided access to or use of any GFI covered by this clause.

                  (b) The withholding of any amount or subsequent payment to the Contractor shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights accruing to the Government under this contract.

                As prescribed in 227.7102-4(c), 227.7103-6(e)(3), 27.7104(e)(5), or 227.7203-6(f), use the following clause:
                
                  Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (SEP 2016)
                  (a) Definitions. The terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause of this contract.
                  (b) Presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense—(1) Commercial items. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will presume that the Contractor's or a subcontractor's asserted use or release restrictions with respect to a commercial item is justified on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense.
                  (ii) The Contracting Officer will not challenge such assertions unless the Contracting Officer has information that demonstrates that the commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense.
                  (2) Major weapon systems. In the case of a challenge to a use or release restriction that is asserted with respect to data of the Contractor or a subcontractor for a major weapon system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the major weapon system, subsystem, or component was developed exclusively at private expense—
                  (i) The presumption in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause applies to—
                  (A) A commercial subsystem or component of a major weapon system, if the major weapon system was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with DFARS subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(a));
                  (B) A component of a subsystem, if the subsystem was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with DFARS subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(b)); and
                  (C) Any other component, if the component is a commercially available off-the-shelf item or a commercially available off-the-shelf item with modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace or minor modifications made to meet Federal Government requirements; and
                  (ii) In all other cases, the challenge to the use or release restriction will be sustained unless information provided by the Contractor or a subcontractor demonstrates that the item or process was developed exclusively at private expense.
                  (c) Justification. The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is responsible for maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity of its markings that impose restrictions on the Government and others to use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to be delivered under the contract or subcontract. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of this clause.
                  (d) Prechallenge request for information. (1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use technical data. If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.

                  (2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the marking and that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this clause.
                  (3) If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.
                  (e) Challenge. (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the Contracting Officer shall send a written challenge notice to the Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. Such challenge shall—
                  (i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;
                  (ii) Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted restriction;
                  (iii) State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and
                  (iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this clause.
                  (2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.
                  (3) The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be considered a claim within the meaning of the 41 U.S.C. 7101, Contract Disputes and shall be certified in the form prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless of dollar amount.
                  (4) A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, shall formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule shall afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.
                  (f) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond. Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and the Disputes clause of this contract pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction. This final decision shall be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2) of this clause. Following issuance of the final decision, the Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this clause.
                  (g) Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds. (1) if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking. This final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.
                  (2)(i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the longer period that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.

                  (ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking of a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.
                  (iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.
                  (iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.
                  (h) Final disposition of appeal or suit. (1) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained—
                  (i) The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be cancelled, corrected or ignored; and
                  (ii) If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.
                  (2) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is not sustained—
                  (i) The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive marking; and
                  (ii) The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith.
                  (i) Duration of right to challenge. The Government may review the validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor. During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data—
                  (1) Is publicly available;
                  (2) Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or
                  (3) Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes “validation” as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.
                  (j) Decision not to challenge. A decision by the Government, or a determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute “validation.”
                  (k) Privity of contract. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings. However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract between the Government and subcontractors.
                  (l) Flowdown. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in contractual instruments, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial items, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data.

                  (B) Will not revoke the license in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public; and
                  (C) May revoke or modify the license in any foreign country to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
                  (iii) Before revoking or modifying the license, the agency—
                  (A) Will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license; and
                  (B) Will allow the Contractor 30 days (or such other time as the funding agency may authorize for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified.

                  (ii) Include in the disclosure—
                  (A) The inventor(s) and the contract under which the invention was made;
                  (B) Sufficient technical detail to convey a clear understanding of the invention; and
                  (C) Any publication, on sale (i.e., sale or offer for sale), or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication; and
                  (iii) After submission of the disclosure, promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication and of any on sale or public use.
                  (2) The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain ownership of any subject invention by notifying the Contracting Officer at the time of disclosure or within 8 months of disclosure, as to those countries (including the United States) in which the Contractor will retain ownership. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the agency may shorten the period of election of title to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.
                  (3) The Contractor shall—
                  (i) File either a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application on an elected subject invention within 1 year after election, provided that in all cases the application is filed prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use;
                  (ii) File a nonprovisional application within 10 months of the filing of any provisional application; and
                  (iii) File patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either 10 months of the first filed patent application (whether provisional or nonprovisional) or 6 months from the date the Commissioner of Patents grants permission to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
                  (4) The Contractor may request extensions of time for disclosure, election, or filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause. The Contracting Officer will normally grant the extension unless there is reason to believe the extension would prejudice the Government's interests.
                  (d) Government's rights—(1) Ownership. The Contractor shall assign to the agency, upon written request, title to any subject invention—
                  (i) If the Contractor elects not to retain title to a subject invention;
                  (ii) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause and the agency requests title within 60 days after learning of the Contractor's failure to report or elect within the specified times;
                  (iii) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, provided that, if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain ownership in that country; and

                  (A) Disclose each subject invention promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters, so that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions in paragraph (c) of this clause; and

                  (B) Provide the disclosure in the Contractor's format, which should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;
                  
                  (ii) Instruct its employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or statutory foreign bars; and

                  (iii) Upon request, furnish the Contracting Officer a description of these procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.
                  (6) The Contractor shall, when licensing a subject invention, arrange to—

                  (ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work, listing all subject inventions or stating that there were no subject inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent rights clause or stating that there were no subcontracts.
                  (8)(i) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying—
                  (A) The subcontractor;
                  (B) The applicable patent rights clause;
                  (C) The work to be performed under the subcontract; and
                  (D) The dates of award and estimated completion.
                  (ii) The Contractor shall furnish, upon request, a copy of the subcontract, and no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.
                  (9) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept one of the clauses specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this clause, the Contractor—
                  (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for the refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and
                  (ii) Shall not proceed with that subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.
                  (10) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer, upon request, the following information for any subject invention for which the Contractor has retained ownership:
                  (i) Filing date.
                  (ii) Serial number and title.

                  (2) To the extent permitted by law, the agency shall not disclose the information provided under paragraph (f)(1) of this clause to persons outside the Government without the Contractor's permission, if the data or information is considered by the Contractor or its licensee or assignee to be “privileged and confidential” (see 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) and is so marked.
                  (g) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless the person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the agency may waive the requirement for an exclusive license agreement upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that—
                  (1) Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States; or
                  (2) Under the circumstances, domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
                  (h) March-in rights. The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has retained ownership, the agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), 37 CFR 401.6, and any supplemental regulations of the agency in effect on the date of contract award.
                  (i) Other inventions. Nothing contained in this clause shall be deemed to grant to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a subject invention.
                  (j) Examination of records relating to inventions. (1) The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or first reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether—
                  (i) Any inventions are subject inventions;
                  (ii) The Contractor has established procedures required by paragraph (e)(5) of this clause; and
                  (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.
                  (2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contractor shall be required to disclose the invention to the agency for a determination of ownership rights.
                  (3) Any examination of records under this paragraph (j) shall be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.
                  (k) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to subcontracts). (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of the contract, whichever is less, is set aside if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to—
                  (i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this clause;
                  (ii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;
                  (iii) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this clause; or
                  (iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to paragraph (e)(8) of this clause.
                  (2) The reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.
                  (3) The Government will not make final payment under this contract before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer—
                  (i) All disclosures of subject inventions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;
                  (ii) An acceptable final report pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this clause; and
                  (iii) All past due confirmatory instruments.
                  (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized in paragraph (k)(1) of this clause. No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government right.
                  (l) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor—
                  (i) Shall include the substance of the Patent Rights-Ownership by the Contractor clause set forth at 52.227-11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), in all subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small business concern or nonprofit organization; and

                  (ii) Shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (l), in all other subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work, unless a different patent rights clause is required by FAR 27.303.
                  (2) For subcontracts at any tier—
                  (i) The patents rights clause included in the subcontract shall retain all references to the Government and shall provide to the subcontractor all the rights and obligations provided to the Contractor in the clause. The Contractor shall not, as consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions; and
                  (ii) The Government, the Contractor, and the subcontractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Government with respect to those matters covered by this clause. However, nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes statute in connection with proceedings under paragraph (h) of this clause.

                  (i) For land-based aircraft, “flight” begins with the taxi roll from a flight line on the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has completed the taxi roll in returning to a flight line on the Contractor's premises.
                  (ii) For seaplanes, “flight” begins with the launching from a ramp on the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has completed its landing run and is beached at a ramp on the Contractor's premises.
                  (iii) For helicopters, “flight” begins upon engagement of the rotors for the purpose of take-off from the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has returned to the ground on the Contractor's premises and the rotors are disengaged.

                  (1) The Contracting Officer, when finding that the Contractor has failed to comply with paragraph (b) of this clause or that the aircraft is in the open under unreasonable conditions, shall notify the Contractor in writing and shall require the Contractor to make corrections within a reasonable time.
                  (2) Upon receipt of the notice, the Contractor shall promptly correct the cited conditions, regardless of whether there is agreement that the conditions are unreasonable.
                  (i) If the Contracting Officer later determines that the cited conditions were not unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs incurred in correcting the conditions.
                  (ii) Any dispute as to the unreasonableness of the conditions or the equitable adjustment shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
                  (3) If the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor failed to act promptly to correct the cited conditions or failed to correct the conditions within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may terminate the Government's assumption of risk for any aircraft in the open under the cited conditions. The termination will be effective at 12:01 a.m. on the fifteenth day following the day the written notice is received by the Contractor.
                  (i) If the Contracting Officer later determines that the Contractor acted promptly to correct the cited conditions or that the time taken by the Contractor was not unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs incurred as a result of termination of the Government's assumption of risk.
                  (ii) Any dispute as to the timeliness of the Contractor's action or the equitable adjustment shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
                  (4) If the Government terminates its assumption of risk pursuant to the terms of this clause—
                  (i) The Contractor shall thereafter assume the entire risk for damage, loss, or destruction of the affected aircraft;
                  (ii) Any costs incurred by the Contractor (including the costs of the Contractor's self-insurance, insurance premiums paid to insure the Contractor's assumption of risk, deductibles associated with such purchased insurance, etc.) to mitigate its assumption of risk are unallowable costs; and
                  (iii) The liability provisions of the Government Property clause of this contract are not applicable to the affected aircraft.
                  (5) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer when unreasonable conditions have been corrected.
                  (i) If, upon receipt of the Contractor's notice of the correction of the unreasonable conditions, the Government elects to again assume the risk of loss and relieve the Contractor of its liability for damage, loss, or destruction of the aircraft, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the Contracting Officer's decision to resume the Government's risk of loss. The Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any insurance costs extending from the end of the third working day after the Government's receipt of the Contractor's notice of correction until the Contractor is notified that the Government will resume the risk of loss.
                  (ii) If the Government does not again assume the risk of loss and the unreasonable conditions have been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for insurance costs, if any, extending after the third working day after the Government's receipt of the Contractor's notice of correction.
                  (6) The Government's termination of its assumption of risk of loss does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to comply with all other provisions of this clause, including the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations.”
                  (e) Exclusions from the Government's assumption of risk. The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft which—

                  (1) Results from failure of the Contractor, due to willful misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the Contractor's managerial personnel, to maintain and administer a program for the protection and preservation of aircraft in the open and during operation in accordance with sound industrial practice, including oversight of a subcontractor's program;
                  (2) Is sustained during flight if either the flight or the flight crew members have not been approved in advance of any flight in writing by the Government Flight Representative, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations”;
                  (3) Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance on public streets, highways, or waterways, except for Government-furnished property;
                  (4) Is covered by insurance;

                  (5) Consists of wear and tear; deterioration (including rust and corrosion); freezing; or mechanical, structural, or electrical breakdown or failure, unless these are the result of other loss, damage or destruction covered by this clause. (This exclusion does not apply to Government-furnished property if damage consists of reasonable wear and tear or deterioration, or results from inherent vice, e.g., a known condition or design defect in the property); or
                  (6) Is sustained while the aircraft is being worked on and is a direct result of the work unless such damage, loss, or destruction would be covered by insurance which would have been maintained by the Contractor, but for the Government's assumption of risk.
                  (f) Contractor's share of loss and Contractor's deductible under the Government's self-insurance. (1) The Contractor assumes the risk of loss and shall be responsible for the Contractor's share of loss under the Government's self-insurance. That share is the lesser of—
                  (i) The first $100,000 of loss or damage to aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight resulting from each separate event, except for reasonable wear and tear and to the extent the loss or damage is caused by negligence of Government personnel; or
                  (ii) Twenty percent of the price or estimated cost of this contract.
                  (2) If the Government elects to require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition immediately prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price authorized by paragraph (j) of this clause shall not include the dollar amount of the risk assumed by the Contractor.
                  (3) In the event the Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees to credit the contract price or pay the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, the lesser of—
                  (i) $100,000;
                  (ii) Twenty percent of the price or estimated cost of this contract; or
                  (iii) The amount of the loss.
                  (4) For task order and delivery order contracts, the Contractor's share of the loss shall be the lesser of $100,000 or twenty percent of the combined total price or total estimated cost of those orders issued to date to which the clause applies.
                  (5) The costs incurred by the Contractor for its share of the loss and for insuring against that loss are unallowable costs, including but not limited to—
                  (i) The Contractor's share of loss under the Government's self-insurance;
                  (ii) The costs of the Contractor's self-insurance;
                  (iii) The deductible for any Contractor-purchased insurance;
                  (iv) Insurance premiums paid for Contractor-purchased insurance; and
                  (v) Costs associated with determining, litigating, and defending against the Contractor's liability.
                  (g) Subcontractor possession or control. The Contractor shall not be relieved from liability for damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft while such aircraft is in the possession or control of its subcontractors, except to the extent that the subcontract, with the written approval of the Contracting Officer, provides for relief from each liability. In the absence of approval, the subcontract shall contain provisions requiring the return of aircraft in as good condition as when received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for the utilization of the property in accordance with the provisions of this contract.
                  (h) Contractor's exclusion of insurance costs. The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and will not include, except as may be authorized in this clause, any charge or contingency reserve for insurance covering damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in flight when the risk has been assumed by the Government, including the Contractor share of loss in this clause, even if the assumption may be terminated for aircraft in the open.
                  (i) Procedures in the event of loss. (1) In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor shall take all reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further damage, to separate damaged and undamaged aircraft, and to put all aircraft in the best possible order. Except in cases covered by paragraph (f)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a statement of—
                  (i) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;
                  (ii) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;
                  (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft are a part; and

                  (iv) The insurance, if any, covering the interest in commingled property.
                  
                  (2) The Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing the obligations under this paragraph.
                  (j) Loss prior to delivery. (1) If prior to delivery and acceptance by the Government, aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government assumed the risk, the Government shall either—
                  (i) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to the condition immediately prior to the damage, in which event the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the contract price and the time for contract performance; or
                  (ii) Terminate this contract with respect to the aircraft. Notwithstanding the provisions in any other termination clause under this contract, in the event of termination, the Contractor shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft (or, if applicable, any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any amount the Contracting Officer determines—
                  (A) It would have cost the Contractor to complete the aircraft (or any work to be performed on the aircraft) together with anticipated profit on uncompleted work; and
                  (B) Would be the value of the damaged aircraft or any salvage retained by the Contractor.
                  (2) The Contracting Officer shall prescribe the manner of disposition of the damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft, or any parts of the aircraft. If any additional costs of such disposition are incurred by the Contractor, a further equitable adjustment will be made in the amount due the Contractor. Failure of the parties to agree upon termination costs or an equitable adjustment with respect to any aircraft shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
                  (k) Reimbursement from a third party. In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or compensated by a third party for damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft and has also been compensated by the Government, the Contractor shall equitably reimburse the Government. The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's right to recover against third parties for damage, loss, or destruction. Upon the request of the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the Contractor shall at Government expense furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment or subrogation) in obtaining recovery.
                  (l) Government acceptance of liability. To the extent the Government has accepted such liability under other provisions of this contract, the Contractor shall not be reimbursed for liability to third persons for loss or damage to property or for death or bodily injury caused by aircraft during flight unless the flight crew members previously have been approved for this flight in writing by the Government Flight Representative, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation entitled “Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations”.
                  (m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall incorporate the requirements of this clause, including this paragraph (m), in all subcontracts.

                Status of contractors as a direct contractor (Spain).
                As prescribed in 229.402-70(d), use the following clause:
                
                  Status of Contractor as a Director Contractor (Spain) (JUN 1997)
                  (a) “Direct Contractor,” as used in this clause, means an individual, company, or entity with whom an agency of the United States Department of Defense has executed a written agreement that allows duty-free import of equipment, materials, and supplies into Spain for the construction, development, maintenance, and operation of Spanish-American installations and facilities.

                  (b) The Contractor is hereby designated as a Direct Contractor under the provisions of Complementary Agreement 5, articles 11, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the Agreement on Friendship, Defense and Cooperation between the United States Government and the Kingdom of Spain, dated July 2, 1982. The Agreement relates to contacts to be performed in whole or part in Spain, the provisions of which are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this contract by reference.
                  
                  (c) The Contractor shall apply to the appropriate Spanish authorities for approval of status as a Direct Contractor in order to complete duty-free import of non-Spanish equipment, materials, and supplies represented as necessary for contract performance by the Contracting Officer. Orders for equipment, materials, and supplies placed prior to official notification of such approval shall be at the Contractor's own risk. The Contractor must submit its documentation in sufficient time to permit processing by the appropriate United States and Spanish Government agencies prior to the arrival of the equipment, material, or supplies in Spain. Seasonal variations in processing times are common, and the Contractor should program its projects accordingly. Any delay or expense arising directly or indirectly from this process shall not excuse untimely performance (except as expressly allowed in other provisions of this contract), constitute a direct or constructive change, or otherwise provide a basis for additional compensation or adjustment of any kind.
                  (d) To ensure that all duty-free imports are properly accounted for, exported, or disposed of, in accordance with Spanish law, the Contractor shall obtain a written bank letter of guaranty payable to the Treasurer of the United States, or such other authority as may be designated by the Contracting Officer, in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of this clause, prior to effecting any duty-free imports for the performance of this contract.
                  (e) If the Contractor fails to obtain the required guaranty, the Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may withhold a portion of the contract payments in order to establish a fund in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of this clause. The fund shall be used for the payment of import taxes in the event that the Contractor fails to properly account for, export, or dispose of equipment, materials, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.
                  (f) The amount of the bank letter of guaranty or size of the fund required under paragraph (d) or (e) of this clause normally shall be 5 percent of the contract value. However, if the Contractor demonstrates to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the amount retained by the United States Government or guaranteed by the bank is excessive, the amount shall be reduced to an amount commensurate with contingent import tax and duty-free liability. This bank guaranty or fund shall not be released to the Contractor until the Spanish General Directorate of Customs verifies the accounting, export, or disposition of the equipment, material, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.

                  (g) The amount required under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this clause is (Contracting Officer insert amount at time of contract award).
                  
                  (h) The Contractor agrees to insert the provisions of this clause, including this paragraph (h), in all subcontracts.

                Limitation of Government's obligation.
                As prescribed in 232.705-70, use the following clause:
                
                  Limitation of Government's Obligation (APR 2014)
                  (a) Contract line item(s) [Contracting Officer insert after negotiations] is/are incrementally funded. For this/these item(s), the sum of $__ [Contracting Officer insert after negotiations] of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.
                  (b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.” As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those items(s).
                  (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”
                  (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.
                  (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled “Disputes.”
                  (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.

                  (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default.” The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause.
                  (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”
                  (i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.
                  (j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:

                As prescribed in 234.203(1), use the following provision:
                
                  Notice of Earned Value Management System (APR 2008)
                  (a) If the offeror submits a proposal in the amount of $50,000,000 or more—
                  (1) The offeror shall provide documentation that the Cognizant Federal Agency (CFA) has determined that the proposed Earned Value Management System (EVMS) complies with the EVMS guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748) (current version at time of solicitation). The Government reserves the right to perform reviews of the EVMS when deemed necessary to verify compliance.
                  (2) If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this provision, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.
                  (i) The plan shall—
                  (A) Describe the EVMS the offeror intends to use in performance of the contract, and how the proposed EVMS complies with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748;

                  (B) Distinguish between the offeror's existing management system and modifications proposed to meet the EVMS guidelines;
                  
                  (C) Describe the management system and its application in terms of the EVMS guidelines;
                  (D) Describe the proposed procedure for administration of the EVMS guidelines as applied to subcontractors; and
                  (E) Describe the process the offeror will use to determine subcontractor compliance with ANSI/EIA-748.

                252.234-7002
                Earned Value Management System.
                As prescribed in 234.203(2), use the following clause:
                
                  Earned Value Management System (MAY 2011)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Acceptable earned value management system means an earned value management system that generally complies with system criteria in paragraph (b) of this clause.
                  
                    Earned value management system means an earned value management system that complies with the earned value management system guidelines in the ANSI/EIA-748.
                  
                    Significant deficiency means a shortcoming in the system that materially affects the ability of officials of the Department of Defense to rely upon information produced by the system that is needed for management purposes.
                  (b) System criteria. In the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall use—
                  (1) An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that complies with the EVMS guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748); and
                  (2) Management procedures that provide for generation of timely, reliable, and verifiable information for the Contract Performance Report (CPR) and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) required by the CPR and IMS data items of this contract.
                  (c) If this contract has a value of $50 million or more, the Contractor shall use an EVMS that has been determined to be acceptable by the Cognizant Federal Agency (CFA). If, at the time of award, the Contractor's EVMS has not been determined by the CFA to be in compliance with the EVMS guidelines as stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contractor shall apply its current system to the contract and shall take necessary actions to meet the milestones in the Contractor's EVMS plan.
                  (d) If this contract has a value of less than $50 million, the Government will not make a formal determination that the Contractor's EVMS complies with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 with respect to the contract. The use of the Contractor's EVMS for this contract does not imply a Government determination of the Contractor's compliance with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 for application to future contracts. The Government will allow the use of a Contractor's EVMS that has been formally reviewed and determined by the CFA to be in compliance with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.

                  (e) The Contractor shall submit notification of any proposed substantive changes to the EVMS procedures and the impact of those changes to the CFA. If this contract has a value of $50 million or more, unless a waiver is granted by the CFA, any EVMS changes proposed by the Contractor require approval of the CFA prior to implementation. The CFA will advise the Contractor of the acceptability of such changes as soon as practicable (generally within 30 calendar days) after receipt of the Contractor's notice of proposed changes. If the CFA waives the advance approval requirements, the Contractor shall disclose EVMS changes to the CFA at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of implementation.
                  (f) The Government will schedule integrated baseline reviews as early as practicable, and the review process will be conducted not later than 180 calendar days after—
                  (1) Contract award;
                  (2) The exercise of significant contract options; and
                  (3) The incorporation of major modifications.
                  
                  During such reviews, the Government and the Contractor will jointly assess the Contractor's baseline to be used for performance measurement to ensure complete coverage of the statement of work, logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, and identification of inherent risks.
                  (g) The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records and data requested by the Contracting Officer or duly authorized representative as necessary to permit Government surveillance to ensure that the EVMS complies, and continues to comply, with the performance criteria referenced in paragraph (b) of this clause.
                  (h) When indicated by contract performance, the Contractor shall submit a request for approval to initiate an over-target baseline or over-target schedule to the Contracting Officer. The request shall include a top-level projection of cost and/or schedule growth, a determination of whether or not performance variances will be retained, and a schedule of implementation for the rebaselining. The Government will acknowledge receipt of the request in a timely manner (generally within 30 calendar days).
                  (i) Significant deficiencies. (1) The Contracting Officer will provide an initial determination to the Contractor, in writing, on any significant deficiencies. The initial determination will describe the deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the Contractor to understand the deficiency.
                  (2) The Contractor shall respond within 30 days to a written initial determination from the Contracting Officer that identifies significant deficiencies in the Contractor's EVMS. If the Contractor disagrees with the initial determination, the Contractor shall state, in writing, its rationale for disagreeing.
                  (3) The Contracting Officer will evaluate the Contractor's response and notify the Contractor, in writing, of the Contracting Officer's final determination concerning—
                  (i) Remaining significant deficiencies;
                  (ii) The adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action;
                  (iii) System noncompliance, when the Contractor's existing EVMS fails to comply with the earned value management system guidelines in the ANSI/EIA-748; and
                  (iv) System disapproval, if initial EVMS validation is not successfully completed within the timeframe approved by the Contracting Officer, or if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor's earned value management system contains one or more significant deficiencies in high-risk guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 standards (guidelines 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, or 32). When the Contracting Officer determines that the existing earned value management system contains one or more significant deficiencies in one or more of the remaining 16 guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 standards, the contracting officer will use discretion to disapprove the system based on input received from functional specialists and the auditor.
                  (4) If the Contractor receives the Contracting Officer's final determination of significant deficiencies, the Contractor shall, within 45 days of receipt of the final determination, either correct the significant deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the significant deficiencies.
                  (j) Withholding payments. If the Contracting Officer makes a final determination to disapprove the Contractor's EVMS, and the contract includes the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, the Contracting Officer will withhold payments in accordance with that clause.
                  (k) With the exception of paragraphs (i) and (j) of this clause, the Contractor shall require its subcontractors to comply with EVMS requirements as follows:
                  (1) For subcontracts valued at $50 million or more, the following subcontractors shall comply with the requirements of this clause:

                  (2) For subcontracts valued at less than $50 million, the following subcontractors shall comply with the requirements of this clause, excluding the requirements of paragraph (c) of this clause:
                  
                    [Contracting Officer to insert names of subcontractors (or subcontracted effort if subcontractors have not been selected) designated for application of the EVMS requirements of this clause.]

                Protection of Human Subjects.
                As prescribed in 235.072(e), use the following clause:
                
                  Protection of Human Subjects (JUL 2009)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  (1) Assurance of compliance means a written assurance that an institution will comply with requirements of 32 CFR Part 219, as well as the terms of the assurance, which the Human Research Protection Official determines to be appropriate for the research supported by the Department of Defense (DoD) component (32 CFR 219.103).
                  (2) Human Research Protection Official (HRPO) means the individual designated by the head of the applicable DoD component and identified in the component's Human Research Protection Management Plan as the official who is responsible for the oversight and execution of the requirements of this clause, although some DoD components may use a different title for this position.
                  (3) Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information (32 CFR 219.102(f)). For example, this could include the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable living human subjects as well as graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable living human subjects.
                  (4) Institution means any public or private entity or agency (32 CFR 219.102(b)).
                  (5) Institutional Review Board (IRB) means a board established for the purposes expressed in 32 CFR Part 219 (32 CFR 219.102(g)).
                  (6) IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the research has been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other institutional and Federal requirements (32 CFR 219.102(h)).
                  (7) Research means a systematic investigation, including research, development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Activities that meet this definition constitute research for purposes of 32 CFR Part 219, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program that is considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities (32 CFR 219.102(d)).

                  (b) The Contractor shall oversee the execution of the research to ensure compliance with this clause. The Contractor shall comply fully with 32 CFR Part 219 and DoD Directive 3216.02, applicable DoD component policies, 10 U.S.C. 980, and, when applicable, Food and Drug Administration policies and regulations.
                  (c) The Contractor shall not commence performance of research involving human subjects that is covered under 32 CFR Part 219 or that meets exemption criteria under 32 CFR 219.101(b), or expend funding on such effort, until and unless the conditions of either the following paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) have been met:
                  (1) The Contractor furnishes to the HRPO, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, an assurance of compliance and IRB approval and receives notification from the Contracting Officer that the HRPO has approved the assurance as appropriate for the research under the Statement of Work and also that the HRPO has reviewed the protocol and accepted the IRB approval for compliance with the DoD component policies. The Contractor may furnish evidence of an existing assurance of compliance for acceptance by the HRPO, if an appropriate assurance has been approved in connection with previous research. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer immediately of any suspensions or terminations of the assurance.
                  (2) The Contractor furnishes to the HRPO, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, a determination that the human research proposed meets exemption criteria in 32 CFR 219.101(b) and receives written notification from the Contracting Officer that the exemption is determined acceptable. The determination shall include citation of the exemption category under 32 CFR 219.101(b) and a rationale statement. In the event of a disagreement regarding the Contractor's furnished exemption determination, the HRPO retains final judgment on what research activities or classes of research are covered or are exempt under the contract.
                  (d) DoD staff, consultants, and advisory groups may independently review and inspect the Contractor's research and research procedures involving human subjects and, based on such findings, DoD may prohibit research that presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with DoD procedures.
                  (e) Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause will result in the issuance of a stop-work order under Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.242-15 to immediately suspend, in whole or in part, work and further payment under this contract, or will result in other issuance of suspension of work and further payment for as long as determined necessary at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.
                  (f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (f), in all subcontracts that may include research involving human subjects in accordance with 32 CFR Part 219, DoD Directive 3216.02, and 10 U.S.C. 980, including research that meets exemption criteria under 32 CFR 219.101(b). This clause does not apply to subcontracts that involve only the use of cadaver materials.

                  Airfield Safety Precautions (DEC 1991)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  (1) Landing areas means—
                  (i) The primary surfaces, comprising the surface of the runway, runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones. The length of each primary surface is the same as the runway length. The width of each primary surface is 2,000 feet (1,000 feet on each side of the runway centerline);
                  (ii) The clear zone beyond the ends of each runway, i.e., the extension of the primary surface for a distance of 1,000 feet beyond each end of each runway;
                  (iii) All taxiways, plus the lateral clearance zones along each side for the length of the taxiways (the outer edge of each lateral clearance zone is laterally 250 feet from the far or opposite edge of the taxiway, e.g., a 75-foot-wide taxiway would have a combined width of taxiway and lateral clearance zones of 425 feet); and
                  (iv) All aircraft parking aprons, plus the area 125 feet in width extending beyond each edge all around the aprons.
                  (2) Safety precaution areas means those portions of approach-departure clearance zones and transitional zones where placement of objects incident to contract performance might result in vertical projections at or above the approach-departure clearance, or the transitional surface.
                  (i) The approach-departure clearance surface is an extension of the primary surface and the clear zone at each end of each runway, for a distance of 50,000 feet, first along an inclined (glide angle) and then along a horizontal plane, both flaring symmetrically about the runway centerline extended.
                  (A) The inclined plane (glide angle) begins in the clear zone 200 feet past the end of the runway (and primary surface) at the same elevation as the end of the runway. It continues upward at a slope of 50:1 (1 foot vertically for each 50 feet horizontally) to an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. At that point the plane becomes horizontal, continuing at that same uniform elevation to a point 50,000 feet longitudinally from the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) and ending there.
                  (B) The width of the surface at the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) is the same as the width of the clear zone. It then flares uniformly, reaching the maximum width of 16,000 feet at the end.
                  (ii) The approach-departure clearance zone is the ground area under the approach-departure clearance surface.
                  (iii) The transitional surface is a sideways extension of all primary surfaces, clear zones, and approach-departure clearance surfaces along inclined planes.
                  (A) The inclined plane in each case begins at the edge of the surface.
                  (B) The slope of the incline plane is 7:1 (1 foot vertically for each 7 feet horizontally). It continues to the point of intersection with the—
                  (1) Inner horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airfield elevation); or
                  (2) Outer horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 500 feet above the established airfield elevation), whichever is applicable.
                  (iv) The “transitional zone” is the ground area under the transitional surface. (It adjoins the primary surface, clear zone, and approach-departure clearance zone.)
                  (b) General. (1) The Contractor shall comply with the requirements of this clause while—
                  (i) Operating all ground equipment (mobile or stationary);
                  (ii) Placing all materials; and
                  (iii) Performing all work, upon and around all airfields.
                  (2) The requirements of this clause are in addition to any other safety requirements of this contract.
                  (c) The Contractor shall—
                  (1) Report to the Contracting Officer before initiating any work;
                  (2) Notify the Contracting Officer of proposed changes to locations and operations;
                  (3) Not permit either its equipment or personnel to use any runway for purposes other than aircraft operation without permission of the Contracting Officer, unless the runway is—
                  (i) Closed by order of the Contracting Officer; and

                  (ii) Marked as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;
                  
                  (4) Keep all paved surfaces, such as runways, taxiways, and hardstands, clean at all times and, specifically, free from small stones which might damage aircraft propellers or jet aircraft;
                  (5) Operate mobile equipment according to the safety provisions of this clause, while actually performing work on the airfield. At all other times, the Contractor shall remove all mobile equipment to locations—
                  (i) Approved by the Contracting Officer;
                  (ii) At a distance of at least 750 feet from the runway centerline, plus any additional distance; and
                  (iii) Necessary to ensure compliance with the other provisions of this clause; and
                  (6) Not open a trench unless material is on hand and ready for placing in the trench. As soon as practicable after material has been placed and work approved, the Contractor shall backfill and compact trenches as required by the contract. Meanwhile, all hazardous conditions shall be marked and lighted in accordance with the other provisions of this clause.
                  (d) Landing areas. The Contractor shall—
                  (1) Place nothing upon the landing areas without the authorization of the Contracting Officer;
                  (2) Outline those landing areas hazardous to aircraft, using (unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer) red flags by day, and electric, battery-operated low-intensity red flasher lights by night;
                  (3) Obtain, at an airfield where flying is controlled, additional permission from the control tower operator every time before entering any landing area, unless the landing area is marked as hazardous in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;
                  (4) Identify all vehicles it operates in landing areas by means of a flag on a staff attached to, and flying above, the vehicle. The flag shall be three feet square, and consist of a checkered pattern of international orange and white squares of 1 foot on each side (except that the flag may vary up to ten percent from each of these dimensions);
                  (5) Mark all other equipment and materials in the landing areas, using the same marking devices as in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause; and
                  (6) Perform work so as to leave that portion of the landing area which is available to aircraft free from hazards, holes, piles of material, and projecting shoulders that might damage an airplane tire.
                  (e) Safety precaution areas. The Contractor shall—
                  (1) Place nothing upon the safety precaution areas without authorization of the Contracting Officer;
                  (2) Mark all equipment and materials in safety precaution areas, using (unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer) red flags by day, and electric, battery-operated, low-intensity red flasher lights by night; and
                  (3) Provide all objects placed in safety precaution areas with a red light or red lantern at night, if the objects project above the approach-departure clearance surface or above the transitional surface.

                  (b) An offer which does not state separate prices for the items identified in the Schedule as subject to a cost limitation may be considered nonresponsive.
                  (c) Prices stated in offers for items subject to cost limitations shall include an appropriate apportionment of all costs, direct and indirect, overhead, and profit.
                  (d) Offers may be rejected which—
                  (1) Are materially unbalanced for the purpose of bringing items within cost limitations; or
                  (2) Exceed the cost limitations, unless the limitations have been waived by the Government prior to award.

                  Additive or Deductive Items (DEC 1991)
                  (a) The low offeror and the items to be awarded shall be determined as follows—
                  (1) Prior to the opening of bids, the Government will determine the amount of funds available for the project.
                  (2) The low offeror shall be the Offeror that—
                  (i) Is otherwise eligible for award; and
                  (ii) Offers the lowest aggregate amount for the first or base bid item, plus or minus (in the order stated in the list of priorities in the bid schedule) those additive or deductive items that provide the most features within the funds determined available.
                  (3) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate all bids on the basis of the same additive or deductive items.

                  (i) If adding another item from the bid schedule list of priorities would make the award exceed the available funds for all offerors, the Contracting Officer will skip that item and go to the next item from the bid schedule of priorities; and
                  (ii) Add that next item if an award may be made that includes that item and is within the available funds.
                  (b) The Contracting Officer will use the list of priorities in the bid schedule only to determine the low offeror. After determining the low offeror, an award may be made on any combination of items if—
                  (1) It is in the best interest of the Government;
                  (2) Funds are available at the time of award; and
                  (3) The low offeror's price for the combination to be awarded is less than the price offered by any other responsive, responsible offeror.
                  (c) Example. The amount available is $100,000. Offeror A's base bid and four additives (in the order stated in the list of priorities in the bid Schedule) are $85,000, $10,000, $8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. Offeror B's base bid and four additives are $80,000, $16,000, $9,000, $7,000, and $4,000. Offeror A is the low offeror. The aggregate amount of offeror A's bid for purposes of award would be $99,000, which includes a base bid plus the first and fourth additives. The second and third additives were skipped because each of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000.

Services are essential if the effectiveness of defense systems or operations has the potential to be seriously impaired by the interruption of these services, as determined by the appropriate functional commander or civilian equivalent.
                  (2) Mission-essential functions means those organizational activities that must be performed under all circumstances to achieve DoD component missions or responsibilities, as determined by the appropriate functional commander or civilian equivalent. Failure to perform or sustain these functions would significantly affect DoD's ability to provide vital services or exercise authority, direction, and control.

                  (d)(1) Notwithstanding any other clause of this contract, the Contractor shall be responsible to perform those services identified as essential contractor services during crisis situations (as directed by the Contracting Officer), in accordance with its Mission-Essential Contractor Services Plan.
                  
                  (2) In the event the Contractor anticipates not being able to perform any of the essential contractor services identified in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause during a crisis situation, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or other designated representative as expeditiously as possible and use its best efforts to cooperate with the Government in the Government's efforts to maintain the continuity of operations.
                  (e) The Government reserves the right in such crisis situations to use Federal employees, military personnel, or contract support from other contractors, or to enter into new contracts for essential contractor services.
                  (f) Changes. The Contractor shall segregate and separately identify all costs incurred in continuing performance of essential services in a crisis situation. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of an increase or decrease in costs within ninety days after continued performance has been directed by the Contracting Officer, or within any additional period that the Contracting Officer approves in writing, but not later than the date of final payment under the contract. The Contractor's notice shall include the Contractor's proposal for an equitable adjustment and any data supporting the increase or decrease in the form prescribed by the Contracting Officer.

                    Governmental regulatory body means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies which regulate a company owned by the same entity that creates the regulatory body are not governmental regulatory bodies.
                  (b) The Contractor shall acknowledge a communication service authorization or other type order for supplies and facilities by—
                  (1) Commencing performance after receipt of an order; or
                  (2) Written acceptance by a duly authorized representative.
                  (c) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this agreement/contract in accordance with all applicable tariffs, rates, charges, regulations, requirements, terms, and conditions of—
                  (1) Service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers; or

                  (d) The Government will not prepay for services.

                  (e) For nontariffed services, the Contractor shall charge the Government at the lowest rate and under the most favorable terms and conditions for similar service and facilities offered to any other customer.
                  
                  (f) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.
                  (g) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when—
                  (1) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or
                  (2) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.
                  (h) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may—
                  (1) Provide the equipment; or
                  (2) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.
                  (i) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted under applicable tariffs filed by the Contractor with the regulatory commission in effect at the time of deferral or change. If no tariffs are in effect, the Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.

                  (2) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any tariff or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and
                  (3) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.
                  (b) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this agreement/contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this agreement/contract.

                Cancellation or Termination of Orders.
                As prescribed in 239.7411(a), use the following clause:
                
                  Cancellation or Termination of Orders (SEP 2019)
                  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Actual nonrecoverable costs means the installed costs of the facilities and equipment, less cost of reusable materials, and less net salvage value.
                  
                    Basic cancellation liability means the actual nonrecoverable cost, which the Government shall reimburse the Contractor at the time services are cancelled.
                  
                    Basic termination liability means the nonrecoverable cost amortized in equal monthly increments throughout the liability period.
                  
                    Installed costs means the actual cost of equipment and materials specifically provided or used, plus the actual cost of installing (including engineering, labor, supervision, transportation, rights-of-way, and any other items which are chargeable to the capital accounts of the Contractor), less any costs the government may have directly reimbursed the Contractor under the Special Construction and Equipment Charges clause of this agreement/contract.
                  
                    Net salvage value means the salvage value less the cost of removal.

                  (b) If the Government cancels any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract, before the services are made available to the Government, or terminates any of these services after they are made available to the Government, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for the actual nonrecoverable costs the Contractor has reasonably incurred in providing facilities and equipment for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse. The Government will not reimburse the Contractor for any actual nonrecoverable costs incurred after notice of award, but prior to execution of the order.
                  (c) When feasible, the Contractor shall reuse cancelled or terminated facilities or equipment to minimize the charges to the Government.
                  (d) If at any time the Government requires that telecommunications facilities or equipment be relocated within the Contractor's service area, the Government will have the option of paying the costs of relocating the facilities or equipment in lieu of paying any termination or cancellation charge under this clause. The basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability applicable to the facilities or equipment in their former location shall continue to apply to the facilities and equipment in their new location. Monthly recurring charges shall continue to be paid during the period.
                  (e) When there is another requirement or foreseeable reuse in place of cancelled or terminated facilities or equipment, no charge shall apply and the basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability shall be appropriately reduced. When feasible, the Contractor shall promptly reuse discontinued channels or facilities, including equipment for which the Government is obligated to pay a minimum service charge.
                  (f) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract will be determined under applicable tariffs governing cancellation and termination charges which—
                  (1) Are filed by the Contractor with a governmental regulatory body, as defined in the Orders For Facilities and Services clause of this agreement/contract;
                  (2) Are in effect on the date of termination; and
                  (3) Provide specific cancellation or termination charges for the facilities and equipment involved or show how to determine the charges.
                  (g) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract, which are not subject to a governmental regulatory body, will be determined under a mutually agreed schedule in the communication services authorization (CSA) or other contractual document.
                  (h) If no applicable tariffs are in effect on the date of cancellation or termination or set forth in the applicable CSA or other contractual document, the Government's liability will be determined under the following settlement procedures—
                  (1) The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, inventory schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the Contractor's possession, the cost of which is included in the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.
                  (2) The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or facilities when the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the Government has not exercised its option to take title under the Title to Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment clause of this agreement/contract. The Contractor shall apply any proceeds of the sale to reduce any payments by the Government to the Contractor under a cancellation or termination settlement.
                  (3) The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under established accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to the provision of telecommunication services for public use.
                  (4) The net salvage value shall be deducted from the Contractor's installed cost. In determining net salvage value, the Contractor shall consider the foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment by the Contractor. The Contractor shall make allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when necessary either for the sale of facilities or their reuse by the Contractor in another location.
                  (5) Upon termination of services, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for the nonrecoverable cost less such costs amortized to the date services are terminated and establish the liability period as mutually agreed to but not to exceed ten years. In the case of either a cancellation or a termination, the Government's presumed maximum liability will be capped by the unpaid non-recurring charges and the monthly recurring charges set out in the contract/agreement. The presumed maximum liability for monthly recurring charges shall be capped at monthly recurring charges for the minimum service period and any required notice period.
                  (6) When the basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability established by the CSA or other contractual document is based on estimated costs, the Contractor agrees to settle on the basis of actual cost at the time of cancellation or termination.
                  (7) The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the termination liability period of the services, should the Contractor make reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or nonsalvable in the settlement, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for the value of the equipment or facilities.
                  (8) The Contractor agrees to exclude—

                  (i) Any costs which are not included in determining cancellation and termination charges under the Contractor's standard practices or procedures; and
                  (ii) Charges not ordinarily made by the Contractor for similar facilities or equipment, furnished under similar circumstances.
                  (i) The Government may, under such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the cancelled or terminated portion of this agreement/contract. The Government may make these payments if the Contracting Officer determines that the total of the payments is within the amount the Contractor is entitled. If the total of the payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined to be due under this clause, the Contractor shall pay the excess to the Government upon demand.
                  (j) Failure to agree shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause.

                  (5) Significant deficiency means a shortcoming in the system that materially affects the ability of officials of the Department of Defense to rely upon information produced by the system that is needed for management purposes.
                  (b) General. The Contractor shall—
                  (1) Maintain an MMAS that—
                  (i) Reasonably forecasts material requirements;
                  (ii) Ensures that costs of purchased and fabricated material charged or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements; and
                  (iii) Maintains a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for costing of material transactions; and
                  (2) Assess its MMAS and take reasonable action to comply with the MMAS standards in paragraph (e) of this clause.
                  (c) Disclosure and maintenance requirements. The Contractor shall—
                  (1) Have policies, procedures, and operating instructions that adequately describe its MMAS;
                  (2) Provide to the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), upon request, the results of internal reviews that it has conducted to ensure compliance with established MMAS policies, procedures, and operating instructions; and
                  (3) Disclose significant changes in its MMAS to the ACO at least 30 days prior to implementation.
                  (d) System criteria. The MMAS shall have adequate internal controls to ensure system and data integrity, and shall—
                  (1) Have an adequate system description including policies, procedures, and operating instructions that comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement;
                  (2) Ensure that costs of purchased and fabricated material charged or allocated to a contract are based on valid time-phased requirements as impacted by minimum/economic order quantity restrictions.
                  (i) A 98 percent bill of material accuracy and a 95 percent master production schedule accuracy are desirable as a goal in order to ensure that requirements are both valid and appropriately time-phased.
                  (ii) If systems have accuracy levels below these, the Contractor shall provide adequate evidence that—
                  (A) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower accuracy levels; and
                  (B) The cost to meet the accuracy goals is excessive in relation to the impact on the Government;

                  (3) Provide a mechanism to identify, report, and resolve system control weaknesses and manual override. Systems should identify operational exceptions, such as excess/residual inventory, as soon as known;
                  (4) Provide audit trails and maintain records (manual and those in machine-readable form) necessary to evaluate system logic and to verify through transaction testing that the system is operating as desired;
                  (5) Establish and maintain adequate levels of record accuracy, and include reconciliation of recorded inventory quantities to physical inventory by part number on a periodic basis. A 95 percent accuracy level is desirable. If systems have an accuracy level below 95 percent, the Contractor shall provide adequate evidence that—
                  (i) There is no material harm to the Government due to lower accuracy levels; and
                  (ii) The cost to meet the accuracy goal is excessive in relation to the impact on the Government;
                  (6) Provide detailed descriptions of circumstances that will result in manual or system generated transfers of parts;
                  (7) Maintain a consistent, equitable, and unbiased logic for costing of material transactions as follows:
                  (i) The Contractor shall maintain and disclose written policies describing the transfer methodology and the loan/pay-back technique.
                  (ii) The costing methodology may be standard or actual cost, or any of the inventory costing methods in 48 CFR 9904.411-50(b). The Contractor shall maintain consistency across all contract and customer types, and from accounting period to accounting period for initial charging and transfer charging.
                  (iii) The system should transfer parts and associated costs within the same billing period. In the few instances where this may not be appropriate, the Contractor may accomplish the material transaction using a loan/pay-back technique. The “loan/pay-back technique” means that the physical part is moved temporarily from the contract, but the cost of the part remains on the contract. The procedures for the loan/pay-back technique must be approved by the ACO. When the technique is used, the Contractor shall have controls to ensure—
                  (A) Parts are paid back expeditiously;
                  (B) Procedures and controls are in place to correct any overbilling that might occur;
                  (C) Monthly, at a minimum, identification of the borrowing contract and the date the part was borrowed; and
                  (D) The cost of the replacement part is charged to the borrowing contract;
                  (8) Where allocations from common inventory accounts are used, have controls (in addition to those in paragraphs (d)(2) and (7) of this clause) to ensure that—
                  (i) Reallocations and any credit due are processed no less frequently than the routine billing cycle;
                  (ii) Inventories retained for requirements that are not under contract are not allocated to contracts; and
                  (iii) Algorithms are maintained based on valid and current data;
                  (9) Have adequate controls to ensure that physically commingled inventories that may include material for which costs are charged or allocated to fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, and commercial contracts do not compromise requirements of any of the standards in paragraphs (d)(1) through (8) of this clause. Government-furnished material shall not be—
                  (i) Physically commingled with other material; or
                  (ii) Used on commercial work; and
                  (10) Be subjected to periodic internal reviews to ensure compliance with established policies and procedures.
                  (e) Significant deficiencies. (1) The Contracting Officer will provide an initial determination to the Contractor, in writing, of any significant deficiencies. The initial determination will describe the deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the Contractor to understand the deficiency.
                  (2) The Contractor shall respond within 30 days to a written initial determination from the Contracting Officer that identifies significant deficiencies in the Contractor's MMAS. If the Contractor disagrees with the initial determination, the Contractor shall state, in writing, its rationale for disagreeing.
                  (3) The Contracting Officer will evaluate the Contractor's response and notify the Contractor, in writing, of the Contracting Officer's final determination concerning—
                  (i) Remaining significant deficiencies;
                  (ii) The adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action; and
                  (iii) System disapproval if the Contracting Officer determines that one or more significant deficiencies remain.
                  (f) If the Contractor receives the Contracting Officer's final determination of significant deficiencies, the Contractor shall, within 45 days of receipt of the final determination, either correct the significant deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the significant deficiencies.
                  (g) Withholding payments. If the Contracting Officer makes a final determination to disapprove the Contractor's MMAS, and the contract includes the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, the Contracting Officer will withhold payments in accordance with that clause.

                252.242-7005
                Contractor business systems.
                As prescribed in 242.7001, use the following clause:
                
                  Contractor Business Systems (FEB 2012)
                  (a) This clause only applies to covered contracts that are subject to the Cost Accounting Standards under 41 U.S.C. chapter 15, as implemented in regulations found at 48 CFR 9903.201-1 (see the FAR Appendix).
                  (b) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Acceptable contractor business systems means contractor business systems that comply with the terms and conditions of the applicable business system clauses listed in the definition of “contractor business systems” in this clause.
                  
                    Contractor business systems means—
                  (1) Accounting system, if this contract includes the clause at 252.242-7006, Accounting System Administration;
                  (2) Earned value management system, if this contract includes the clause at 252.234-7002, Earned Value Management System;
                  (3) Estimating system, if this contract includes the clause at 252.215-7002, Cost Estimating System Requirements;
                  (4) Material management and accounting system, if this contract includes the clause at 252.242-7004, Material Management and Accounting System;
                  (5) Property management system, if this contract includes the clause at 252.245-7003, Contractor Property Management System Administration; and
                  (6) Purchasing system, if this contract includes the clause at 252.244-7001, Contractor Purchasing System Administration.
                  
                    Significant deficiency, in the case of a contractor business system, means a shortcoming in the system that materially affects the ability of officials of the Department of Defense to rely upon information produced by the system that is needed for management purposes.
                  (c) General. The Contractor shall establish and maintain acceptable business systems in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.
                  (d) Significant deficiencies. (1) The Contractor shall respond, in writing, within 30 days to an initial determination that there are one or more significant deficiencies in one or more of the Contractor's business systems.
                  (2) The Contracting Officer will evaluate the Contractor's response and notify the Contractor, in writing, of the final determination as to whether the Contractor's business system contains significant deficiencies. If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor's business system contains significant deficiencies, the final determination will include a notice to withhold payments.
                  (e) Withholding payments. (1) If the Contracting Officer issues the final determination with a notice to withhold payments for significant deficiencies in a contractor business system required under this contract, the Contracting Officer will withhold five percent of amounts due from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to withhold five percent from its billings on interim cost vouchers on cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contracts until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer's final determination. The Contractor shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notice, either correct the deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the deficiencies.
                  (2) If the Contractor submits an acceptable corrective action plan within 45 days of receipt of a notice of the Contracting Officer's intent to withhold payments, and the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, determines that the Contractor is effectively implementing such plan, the Contracting Officer will reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies covered under the corrective action plan, to two percent from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to reduce the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to two percent until the Contracting Officer determines the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer's final determination. However, if at any time, the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has failed to follow the accepted corrective action plan, the Contracting Officer will increase withholding from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to increase the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to the percentage initially withheld, until the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer's final determination.
                  (3) Payment withhold percentage limits.
                  
                  (i) The total percentage of payments withheld on amounts due under each progress payment, performance-based payment, or interim cost voucher, on this contract shall not exceed—
                  (A) Five percent for one or more significant deficiencies in any single contractor business system; and

                  (B) Ten percent for significant deficiencies in multiple contractor business systems.
                  
                  (ii) If this contract contains pre-existing withholds, and the application of any subsequent payment withholds will cause withholding under this clause to exceed the payment withhold percentage limits in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will reduce the payment withhold percentage in the final determination to an amount that will not exceed the payment withhold percentage limits.
                  (4) For the purpose of this clause, payment means any of the following payments authorized under this contract:
                  (i) Interim payments under—
                  (A) Cost-reimbursement contracts;
                  (B) Incentive type contracts;
                  (C) Time-and-materials contracts;
                  (D) Labor-hour contracts.
                  (ii) Progress payments.
                  (iii) Performance-based payments.
                  (5) Payment withholding shall not apply to payments on fixed-price line items where performance is complete and the items were accepted by the Government.
                  (6) The withholding of any amount or subsequent payment to the Contractor shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights or remedies the Government has under this contract.
                  (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of any clause in this contract providing for interim, partial, or other payment withholding on any basis, the Contracting Officer may withhold payment in accordance with the provisions of this clause.
                  (8) The payment withholding authorized in this clause is not subject to the interest-penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.
                  (f) Correction of deficiencies. (1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, when the Contractor has corrected the business system's deficiencies.
                  (2) Once the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that all deficiencies have been corrected, the Contracting Officer will take one of the following actions:
                  (i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer's final determination, the Contracting Officer will, as appropriate, discontinue the withholding of progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to discontinue the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers under this contract associated with the Contracting Officer's final determination, and authorize the Contractor to bill for any monies previously withheld that are not also being withheld due to other significant deficiencies. Any payment withholding under this contract due to other significant deficiencies, will remain in effect until the Contracting Officer determines that those significant deficiencies are corrected.
                  (ii) If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor still has significant deficiencies, the Contracting Officer will continue the withholding of progress payments and performance-based payments, and the Contractor shall continue withholding amounts from its billings on interim cost vouchers n accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause, and not bill for any monies previously withheld.
                  (iii) If the Contracting Officer determines, based on the evidence submitted by the Contractor, that there is a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented and are expected to correct the significant deficiencies, the Contracting Officer will discontinue withholding payments, and release any payments previously withheld directly related to the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor notification, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to discontinue the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers associated with the Contracting Officer's final determination, and authorize the Contractor to bill for any monies previously withheld.
                  (iv) If, within 90 days of receipt of the Contractor notification that the Contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the Contracting Officer has not made a determination in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor notification by at least 50 percent of the amount being withheld from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to reduce the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers directly related to the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor notification by a specified percentage that is at least 50 percent, but not authorize the Contractor to bill for any monies previously withheld until the Contracting Officer makes a determination in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this clause.

                  (v) At any time after the Contracting Officer reduces or discontinues the withholding of progress payments and performance-based payments, or directs the Contractor to reduce or discontinue the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers under this contract, if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has failed to correct the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor's notification, the Contracting Officer will reinstate or increase withholding from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to reinstate or increase the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to the percentage initially withheld, until the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer's final determination.

                  (ii) To readily calculate indirect cost rates from the books of accounts;
                  (16) Billings that can be reconciled to the cost accounts for both current and cumulative amounts claimed and comply with contract terms;
                  (17) Adequate, reliable data for use in pricing follow-on acquisitions; and
                  (18) Accounting practices in accordance with standards promulgated by the Cost Accounting Standards Board, if applicable, otherwise, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
                  (d) Significant deficiencies. (1) The Contracting Officer will provide an initial determination to the Contractor, in writing, on any significant deficiencies. The initial determination will describe the deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the Contractor to understand the deficiency.

                  (2) The Contractor shall respond within 30 days to a written initial determination from the Contracting Officer that identifies significant deficiencies in the Contractor's accounting system.

                  (ii) The adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action; and
                  (iii) System disapproval, if the Contracting Officer determines that one or more significant deficiencies remain.

                  (f) Withholding payments. If the Contracting Officer makes a final determination to disapprove the Contractor's accounting system, and the contract includes the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, the Contracting Officer will withhold payments in accordance with that clause.

                  (h) It is expressly agreed that the provisions in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this clause shall not in any manner limit the liability or extend the liability of the Contractor as provided in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this clause.

                  Notification of Anticipated Contract Termination or Reduction (MAY 2019)
                  (a) Definition. As used in this clause—
                  
                    Major defense program means a program that is carried out to produce or acquire a major system (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2302(5)).
                  (b) Section 1372 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160) and Section 824 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Pub. L. 104-201) are intended to help establish benefit eligibility under the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1661 and 1662) for employees of DoD contractors and subcontractors adversely affected by contract terminations or substantial reductions under major defense programs.
                  (c) Notice to employees and state and local officials. Within 2 weeks after the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor that contract funding will be terminated or substantially reduced, the Contractor shall provide notice of such anticipated termination or reduction to—

                  (i) Provide notice to each of its subcontractors with a subcontract that equals or exceeds the threshold specified in DFARS 225.870-4(c)(2)(i)(C) at the time of the notice; and

                Ordering from Government supply sources.
                As prescribed in 251.107, use the following clause:
                
                  Ordering From Government Supply Sources (AUG 2012)
                  (a) When placing orders under Federal Supply Schedules, Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedules, or Enterprise Software Agreements, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable schedule or agreement and authorization. Include in each order:
                  (1) A copy of the authorization (unless a copy was previously furnished to the Federal Supply Schedule, Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedule, or Enterprise Software Agreement contractor).
                  (2) The following statement: Any price reductions negotiated as part of an Enterprise Software Agreement issued under a Federal Supply Schedule contract shall control. In the event of any other inconsistencies between an Enterprise Software Agreement, established as a Federal Supply Schedule blanket purchase agreement, and the Federal Supply Schedule contract, the latter shall govern.
                  (3) The completed address(es) to which the Contractor's mail, freight, and billing documents are to be directed.
                  (b) When placing orders under nonmandatory schedule contracts and requirements contracts, issued by the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Information Resources Management, for automated data processing equipment, software and maintenance, communications equipment and supplies, and teleprocessing services, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable contract and the procedures in paragraph (a) of this clause.
                  (c) When placing orders for Government stock on a reimbursable basis, the Contractor shall—
                  (1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer's authorization, using FEDSTRIP or MILSTRIP procedures, as appropriate;
                  (2) Use only the GSA Form 1948-A, Retail Services Shopping Plate, when ordering from GSA Self-Service Stores;
                  (3) Order only those items required in the performance of Government contracts; and
                  (4) Pay invoices from Government supply sources promptly. For purchases made from DoD supply sources, this means within 30 days of the date of a proper invoice. The Contractor shall annotate each invoice with the date of receipt. For purposes of computing interest for late Contractor payments, the Government's invoice is deemed to be a demand for payment in accordance with the Interest clause of this contract. The Contractor's failure to pay may also result in the DoD supply source refusing to honor the requisition (see DFARS 251.102(f)) or in the Contracting Officer terminating the Contractor's authorization to use DoD supply sources. In the event the Contracting Officer decides to terminate the authorization due to the Contractor's failure to pay in a timely manner, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with prompt written notice of the intent to terminate the authorization and the basis for such action. The Contractor shall have 10 days after receipt of the Government's notice in which to provide additional information as to why the authorization should not be terminated. The termination shall not provide the Contractor with an excusable delay for failure to perform or complete the contract in accordance with the terms of the contract, and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for any increased costs.
                  (d) When placing orders for Government stock on a non-reimbursable basis, the Contractor shall—
                  (1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer's authorization; and
                  (2) When using electronic transactions to submit requisitions on a non-reimbursable basis only, place orders by authorizing contract number using the Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS) Supplement to Federal Implementation Convention 511R, Requisition; and acknowledge receipts by authorizing contract number using the DLMS Supplement 527R, Receipt, Inquiry, Response and Material Receipt Acknowledgement.
                  (e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor use of Government supply sources. The Contracting Officer will not grant authorizations for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor.

                  (f) Government invoices shall be submitted to the Contractor's billing address, and Contractor payments shall be sent to the Government remittance address specified below:
                  
                  Contractor's Billing Address (include point of contact and telephone number):

                  (d) The Contractor shall assume, without the right of reimbursement from the Government, the cost or expense of any use of IFMS vehicles and services not related to the performance of the contract.
                  (e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor use of IFMS vehicles. The Contracting Officer will not grant authorization for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor.

            Part 1—Charter
            1. There is created the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals which is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force, in hearing, considering and determining appeals by contractors from decisions of contracting officers or their authorized representatives or other authorities on disputed questions. These appeals may be taken (a) pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. Sections 7101-7109), (b) pursuant to the provisions of contracts requiring the decision by the Secretary of Defense or by a Secretary of a Military Department or their duly authorized representative, or (c) pursuant to the provisions of any directive whereby the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a Military Department or their authorized representative has granted a right of appeal not contained in the contract on any matter consistent with the contract appeals procedure. The Board may determine contract disputes for other departments and agencies by agreement as permitted by law. The Board shall operate under general policies established or approved by the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition and may perform other duties as directed not inconsistent with the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. The Board shall decide the matters before it independently.
            2. Membership of the Board shall consist of attorneys at law who have been qualified in the manner prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. Appointment of Board members shall be made by the Secretary of Defense. Members of the Board are hereby designated Administrative Judges. There shall be designated from among the appointed Judges of the Board a Chairman and two or more Vice Chairmen. Designation of the Chairman and Vice Chairmen shall be made by the Secretary of Defense, of nominees from Judges of the Board recommended by the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition, in coordination with the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition. When there is a vacancy, the incumbent is unavailable, or for appropriate Board administrative reasons, the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition or the Chairman may designate a Judge of the Board to serve as an Acting Chairman or Acting Vice Chairman.
            3. The Chairman of the Board shall be responsible for establishing appropriate divisions of the Board to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of appeals. The Chairman shall have authority to establish procedures for the issuance of Board decisions. The Chairman may refer an appeal of unusual difficulty, significant precedential importance, or serious dispute within the normal decision process for decision by a Senior Deciding Group established by the Chairman which shall have the authority to overturn prior Board precedent.
            4. It shall be the duty and obligation of the Judges of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals to decide appeals on the record of the appeal to the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with applicable contract provisions and in accordance with law and regulation pertinent thereto.
            5. Any Judge of the Board or any examiner, designated by the Chairman, shall be authorized to hold hearings, examine witnesses, and receive evidence and argument. A Judge of the Board shall have authority to administer oaths and issue subpoenas as specified in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. In cases of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chairman may request orders of the court in the manner prescribed in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.
            6. The Board shall have all powers necessary and incident to the proper performance of its duties. The Board has the authority to issue methods of procedure and rules and regulations for its conduct and for the preparation and presentation of appeals and issuance of opinions.

            7. The Chairman shall be responsible for the internal organization of the Board and for its administration. The Chairman shall provide within approved ceilings for the staffing of the Board with non-Judge personnel, including hearing examiners, as may be required for the performance of the functions of the Board. The Chairman shall appoint a Recorder of the Board. All personnel shall be responsible to and shall function under the direction, supervision and control of the Chairman.
            8. The Board will be serviced by the Department of the Army for administrative support as required for its operations. Administrative support will include budgeting, funding, fiscal control, manpower control and utilization, personnel administration, security administration, supplies, and other administrative services. The Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense will participate in financing the Board's operations on an equal basis and to the extent determined by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). The cost of processing appeals for departments and agencies other than those in the Department of Defense will be reimbursed.
            9. Within 30 days following the close of a fiscal year, the Chairman shall forward a report of the Board's transactions and proceedings for the preceding fiscal year to the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition.
            10. The Board shall have a seal bearing the following inscription: “Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.” This seal shall be affixed to all authentications of copies of records and to such other instruments as the Board may determine.

            11. This revised charter is effective upon the date of the signature of the Secretary of Defense.

            Preface
            I. Jurisdiction for Considering Appeals
            The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (referred to herein as the Board) has jurisdiction to decide any appeal from a final decision of a contracting officer, pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 7101-7109, or its Charter, 48 CFR Chap. 2, App. A, Pt. 1, relative to a contract made by the Department of Defense, the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Air Force, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or any other department or agency, as permitted by law.
            II. Location and Organization of the Board

            (a) The Board's address is Skyline Six, Room 703, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3208; telephone 703-681-8500 (general), 703-681-8502 (Recorder). The Board's facsimile number is 703-681-8535. The Board's Recorder's email address is asbca.recorder@mail.mil. The Board's Web site address is http://www.asbca.mil.
            
            (b) The Board consists of a Chairman, two or more Vice Chairmen, and other Members, all of whom are attorneys at law duly licensed by a state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. Board Members are designated Administrative Judges.
            (c) There are a number of divisions of the Board, established by the Chairman in such manner as to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of appeals. The Chairman and a Vice Chairman act as members of each division. Hearings may be held by an Administrative Judge or by a duly authorized examiner. Except for appeals processed under the expedited or accelerated procedure (see Rules 12.2(c) and 12.3(c)), the decision of a majority of a division constitutes the decision of the Board, unless the Chairman refers the appeal to the Board's Senior Deciding Group (consisting of the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, all division heads, and the Judge who drafted the decision), in which event a decision of a majority of that group constitutes the decision of the Board. Appeals referred to the Senior Deciding Group are those of unusual difficulty or significant precedential importance, or that have occasioned serious dispute within the normal division decision process.

            (d) The Board will to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes.

            Rules
            Rule 1. Appeals
            (a) Taking an Appeal—For appeals subject to the Contract Disputes Act, notice of an appeal shall be in writing and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision. The appellant (contractor) should also furnish a copy of the notice of appeal to the contracting officer. For appeals not subject to the Contract Disputes Act, the contractor should refer to the Disputes clause in its contract for the time period in which it must file a notice of appeal.
            (1) Where the contractor has submitted a claim of $100,000 or less to the contracting officer and has requested a written decision within 60 days from receipt of the request, and the contracting officer has not provided a decision within that period, or where such a contractor request has not been made and the contracting officer has not issued a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.
            (2) Where the contractor has submitted a properly certified claim over $100,000 to the contracting officer or has submitted a claim that involves no monetary amount, and the contracting officer, within 60 days of receipt of the claim, fails to issue a decision or fails to provide the contractor with a reasonable date by which a decision will be issued, and the contracting officer has failed to issue a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.
            (3) A reasonable time shall be determined by taking into account such factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of the information provided by the contractor to support the claim.
            (4) Where an appeal is before the Board pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Rule, the Board may, at its option, stay further proceedings pending issuance of a final decision by the contracting officer within such period of time as is determined by the Board.
            (5) In lieu of filing a notice of appeal under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Rule, the contractor may petition the Board to direct the contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time as determined by the Board.
            (b) Contents of Notice of Appeal—A notice of appeal shall indicate that an appeal is being taken and should identify the contract by number, the department and/or agency involved in the dispute, the decision from which the appeal is taken, and the amount in dispute, if any. A copy of the contracting officer's final decision, if any, should be attached to the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal should be signed by the appellant or by the appellant's duly authorized representative or attorney. The complaint referred to in Rule 6 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or the appellant may designate the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it otherwise fulfills the requirements of a complaint.
            (c) Docketing of Appeal—When a notice of appeal has been received by the Board, it will be docketed. The Board will provide a written notice of docketing to the appellant and to the Government.
            Rule 2. Filing Documents
            (a) Documents may be filed with the Board by the following methods:
            (1) Governmental Postal Service—Documents may be filed via a governmental postal service. Filing occurs when the document, properly addressed and with sufficient postage, is transferred into the custody of the postal service. Contact the Recorder before submitting classified documents.
            
            (2) Courier—Documents may be filed via courier. Filing occurs when the document is delivered to the Board. Contact the Recorder before submitting classified documents.
            (3) Electronic Mail—Documents, except appeal files submitted pursuant to Rule 4, hearing exhibits, classified documents, and documents submitted in camera or under a protective order, may be filed via electronic mail (email). Email attachments should be in PDF format and the attachments may not exceed 10 megabytes total. The transmittal email should include the ASBCA docket number(s), if applicable, and the name of the appellant in the “Subject:” line. Filing occurs upon receipt by the Board's email server. When a document is successfully filed via email, the document should not also be submitted by any other means, unless so directed by the Board. Submit emails to: asbca.recorder@mail.mil.
            
            (4) Facsimile Transmission—Documents, except appeal files submitted pursuant to Rule 4, hearing exhibits, classified documents, and documents submitted in camera or under a protective order, may be filed via facsimile (fax) machine. Due to equipment constraints, transmissions over 10 pages should not be made absent Board permission. Filing occurs upon receipt by the Board. When a document is successfully filed via fax, the document should not also be submitted by any other means, unless so directed by the Board.
            (b) Copies to Opposing Party—The party filing any document with the Board will send a copy to the opposing party unless the Board directs otherwise, noting on the document filed with the Board that a copy has been so furnished.
            Rule 3. Service Upon Other Parties
            Documents may be served personally or by mail, addressed to the party upon whom service is to be made, unless the parties have agreed to an alternate means of service. Subpoenas shall be served as provided in Rule 22.
            Rule 4. Preparation, Content, Organization, Forwarding, and Status of Appeal File
            (a) Duties of the Government—Within 30 days of notice that an appeal has been filed, the Government shall transmit to the Board and the appellant an appeal file consisting of the documents the Government considers relevant to the appeal, including:
            (1) The decision from which the appeal is taken;
            (2) The contract, including pertinent specifications, amendments, plans, and drawings;
            (3) All correspondence between the parties relevant to the appeal, including any claim in response to which the decision was issued.
            The Government's appeal file may be supplemented at such times as are fair and reasonable and as ordered by the Board.
            (b) Duties of the Appellant—Within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the Government's appeal file, the appellant shall transmit to the Board and the Government any documents not contained therein that the appellant considers relevant to the appeal. Appellant's appeal file may be supplemented at such times as are fair and reasonable and as ordered by the Board.
            (c) Organization of Appeal File—Documents in the appeal file may be originals or legible copies, and shall be arranged in chronological order where practicable, tabbed with sequential numbers, and indexed to identify the contents of the file. Any document without internal page numbers shall have page numbers added. All documents must be in English or include an English translation. Documents shall be submitted in 3-ring binders, with spines not wider than 3 inches wide, with labels identifying the name of the appeal, ASBCA number and tab numbers contained in each volume, on the front and spine of each volume. Each volume shall contain an index of the documents contained in the entire Rule 4 submission.
            (d) Status of Documents in Appeal File—Documents contained in the appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to the admissibility of a particular document reasonably in advance of hearing or, if there is no hearing, of settling the record, or in any case as ordered by the Board. If such objection is made, the Board will constructively remove the document from the appeal file and permit the party offering the document to move its admission as evidence in accordance with Rules 10, 11, and 13.
            Rule 5. Time, Computation, and Extensions
            (a) Where practicable, actions should be taken in less time than the time allowed. Where appropriate and justified, however, extensions of time will be granted. All requests for extensions of time should be in writing and indicate that the other party was contacted to seek its concurrence.
            (b) In computing any period of time, the day of the event from which the designated period of time begins to run will not be included, but the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, in which event the period will run to the next business day.
            Rule 6. Pleadings
            (a) Appellant—Within 30 days after receipt of notice of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board a complaint setting forth simple, concise, and direct statements of each of its claims. The complaint shall also set forth the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each claim and the dollar amount claimed, if any. This pleading shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, although no particular form is required. Should the complaint not be timely received, the appellant's claim and notice of appeal may be deemed to set forth its complaint if, in the opinion of the Board, the issues before the Board are sufficiently defined, and the parties will be notified.
            (b) Government—Within 30 days from receipt of the complaint, or the aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall file with the Board an answer thereto. The answer shall admit or deny the allegations of the complaint and shall set forth simple, concise, and direct statements of the Government's defenses to each claim asserted by the appellant, including any affirmative defenses. Should the answer not be timely received, the Board may enter a general denial on behalf of the Government, and the parties will be notified.
            (c) Foreign Law—A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the law of a foreign country shall give notice in its pleadings or other reasonable written notice. The Board, in determining foreign law, may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under Rules 10, 11, or 13. The determination of foreign law shall be treated as a ruling on a question of law.
            (d) Further Pleadings—The Board upon its own initiative or upon motion may order a party to make a more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an answer. The Board may permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions fair to both parties. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, but not raised by the pleadings, are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised therein. In such instances, motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, but are not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided however, that the objecting party may be granted an opportunity to meet such evidence.
            Rule 7. Motions
            (a) Motions Generally—The Board may entertain and rule upon motions and may defer ruling as appropriate. The Board will rule on motions so as to secure, to the fullest extent practicable, the informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of appeals. All motions should be filed as separate documents with an appropriate heading describing the motion. Oral argument on motions is subject to the discretion of the Board.
            (b) Jurisdictional Motions—Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board should be promptly filed. An evidentiary hearing to address disputed jurisdictional facts will be afforded on application of either party or by order of the Board. The Board may defer its decision on the motion pending hearing on the merits. The Board may at any time and on its own initiative raise the issue of its jurisdiction, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.
            (c) Summary Judgment Motions—
            (1) To facilitate disposition of such a motion, the parties should adhere to the following procedures. Where the parties agree that disposition by summary judgment or partial summary judgment is appropriate, they may file a stipulation of all material facts necessary for the Board to rule on the motion. Otherwise, the moving party should file with its motion a “Statement of Undisputed Material Facts,” setting forth the claimed undisputed material facts in separate, numbered paragraphs. The non-moving party should file a “Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Fact,” responding to each numbered paragraph proposed, demonstrating, where appropriate, the existence of material facts in dispute and if appropriate propose additional facts. The moving party and the non-moving party should submit a memorandum of law supporting or opposing summary judgment.
            (2) In deciding motions for summary judgment, the Board looks to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance. The parties should explicitly state and support by specific evidence all facts and legal arguments necessary to sustain a party's position. Each party should cite to the record and attach any additional evidence upon which it relies (e.g., affidavits, declarations, excerpts from depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions). The Board may accept a fact properly proposed and supported by one party as undisputed, unless the opposing party properly responds and establishes that it is in dispute.
            (d) Response to Motions—A non-moving party has 30 days from receipt of a motion to file its response, unless a different period is ordered by the Board. A moving party has 30 days from receipt of a non-moving party's response to file a reply, unless a different period is ordered by the Board.
            Rule 8. Discovery
            (a) General Policy and Protective Orders—The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. Within 45 days after the pleadings have been filed, the parties must confer concerning each party's discovery needs, including the scheduling of discovery and the production of electronically stored information. Absent stipulation or a Board order, no discovery may be served prior to this conference. Any motion pertaining to a discovery dispute shall include a statement that the movant has in good faith attempted to resolve the discovery dispute without involvement of the Board. In connection with any discovery procedure, the Board may issue orders to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, or undue burden or expense. Those orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time, and place for discovery, and provisions for governing the disclosure of information or documents. Any discovery under this Rule shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 16 with respect to sanctions.
            (b) Depositions—When Permitted—Subject to paragraph (a) of this Rule, a party may take, or the Board may upon motion order the taking of, testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. The Board expects the parties to make persons under their control available for deposition. The motion for an order shall specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
            (1) Depositions—Orders—The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by order of the Board.
            (2) Depositions—Use as Evidence—No testimony taken by deposition shall be considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent can testify at the hearing. The deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent given at a hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the Board may receive depositions to supplement the record.
            (3) Depositions—Expenses—Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with the taking of any deposition, absent an agreement by the parties or a Board order to the contrary.
            (4) Depositions—Subpoenas—Where appropriate, a party may request the issuance of a subpoena under the provisions of Rule 22.
            (c) Interrogatories, Requests for Admissions, Requests for Production—Subject to paragraph (a) of this Rule, a party may serve, or the Board may upon motion order:
            (1) Written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed under oath and answered or objected to within 45 days after service;
            (2) A request for the admission of specified facts and/or of the authenticity of any documents, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after service, the factual statements and/or the authenticity of the documents to be deemed admitted upon failure of a party to respond to the request; and
            (3) A request for the production, inspection, and copying of any documents, electronic or otherwise, or objects, not privileged, which reasonably may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, to be answered or objected to within 45 days after service. The Board may allow a shorter or longer time.
            Rule 9. Pre-Hearing or Pre-Submission Conference
            The Board may, upon its own initiative, or upon the request of either party, arrange a conference or order the parties to appear before an Administrative Judge or examiner for a conference to address any issue related to the prosecution of the appeal.
            Rule 10. Hearings
            (a) Where and When Held—Hearings will be held at such times and places determined by the Board to best serve the interests of the parties and the Board.
            (b) Unexcused Absence—The unexcused absence of a party at the time and place set for hearing will not be occasion for delay. In the event of such absence, the hearing will proceed and the evidentiary record will consist solely of the evidence of record at the conclusion of the hearing, except as ordered otherwise by the Board.
            (c) Nature of Hearings—Hearings shall be as informal as may be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. The parties may offer such evidence as they deem appropriate and as would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence or in the sound discretion of the presiding Administrative Judge or examiner. The Federal Rules of Evidence are not binding on the Board but may guide the Board's rulings. The parties may stipulate the testimony that would be given by a witness if the witness were present. The Board may require evidence in addition to that offered by the parties.
            (d) Examination of Witnesses—Witnesses will be examined orally under oath or affirmation, unless the presiding Administrative Judge or examiner shall otherwise order. If the testimony of a witness is not given under oath or affirmation, the Board may advise the witness that his or her testimony may be subject to any provision of law imposing penalties for knowingly making false representations in connection with claims.
            (e) Interpreters—In appropriate cases, the Board may order that an interpreter be used. An interpreter must be qualified and must be placed under oath or affirmation to give a complete and true translation.
            (f) Transcripts—Testimony and argument at hearings will be reported verbatim, unless the Board otherwise orders. The Board will contract for a reporter. No other recordings of the proceedings will be made.
            Rule 11. Submission Without a Hearing
            (a) Either party may elect to waive a hearing and to submit its case upon the record. Submission of a case without hearing does not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts supporting their allegations or defenses. Affidavits, declarations, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed in addition to the Rule 4 file if moved and accepted into evidence. Such submissions may be supplemented by briefs. The Board may designate, with notice to the parties, any document to be made part of the record.
            (b) As appropriate, the Board may also rely on pleadings, prehearing conference memoranda, orders, briefs, stipulations and other documents contained in the Board's file.
            (c) Except as the Board may otherwise order, no evidence will be received after notification by the Board that the record is closed.
            (d) The weight to be given to any evidence will rest within the discretion of the Board. The Board may require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.
            (e) The record will at all reasonable times be available for inspection by the parties at the offices of the Board.
            Rule 12. Optional Small Claims (Expedited) and Accelerated Procedures
            12.1 Elections To Utilize Small Claims (Expedited) and Accelerated Procedures
            (a) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less, or in the case of a small business concern (as defined in the Small Business Act and regulations under that Act), $150,000 or less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under a Small Claims (Expedited) procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 120 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure. The details of this procedure appear in section 12.2 of this Rule. An appellant may elect the Accelerated procedure rather than the Small Claims (Expedited) procedure for any appeal where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less.
            (b) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $100,000 or less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under an Accelerated procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 180 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure. The details of this procedure appear in section 12.3 of this Rule.
            (c) The appellant's election of either the Small Claims (Expedited) procedure or the Accelerated procedure shall be made by written notice within 60 days after receipt of notice of docketing, unless such period is extended by the Board for good cause. The election, once made, may not be changed or withdrawn except with permission of the Board and for good cause.
            (d) The 45-day conference required by Rule 8(a) does not apply to Rule 12 appeals.
            12.2 Small Claims (Expedited) Procedure
            (a) In appeals proceeding under the Small Claims (Expedited) procedure, the following time periods shall apply:
            (1) Within 10 days from the Government's receipt of the appellant's notice of election of the Small Claims (Expedited) procedure, the Government shall send the Board a copy of the contract, the contracting officer's final decision, and the appellant's claim letter or letters, if any. Any other documents required under Rule 4 shall be submitted in accordance with times specified in that Rule unless the Board otherwise directs.
            (2) Within 15 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of the appellant's notice of election, the assigned Administrative Judge should take the following actions, if feasible, in a pre-hearing conference:
            (i) Identify and simplify the issues;
            (ii) Establish a simplified procedure, including discovery, appropriate to the particular appeal involved;
            (iii) Determine whether either party elects a hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefor; and
            (iv) Establish an expedited schedule for the timely resolution of the appeal.
            (b) Pleadings, discovery, and other prehearing activity will be allowed only as consistent with the requirement to conduct a hearing, or if no hearing is elected, to close the record on a date that will allow the timely issuance of the decision. The Board may shorten time periods prescribed or allowed under these Rules as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within the 120-day period.

            (c) Written decisions by the Board in appeals processed under the Small Claims (Expedited) procedure will be short and will contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the Board by a single Administrative Judge. If there has been a hearing, the Administrative Judge presiding at the hearing may at the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such oral argument as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties an authenticated copy of such oral decision for record and payment purposes and to establish the starting date for the period for filing a motion for reconsideration under Rule 20.
            
            (d) A decision under Rule 12.2 shall have no value as precedent, and in the absence of fraud, shall be final and conclusive and may not be appealed or set aside.
            12.3 Accelerated Procedure
            (a) In appeals proceeding under the Accelerated procedure, the parties are encouraged, to the extent possible consistent with adequate presentation of their factual and legal positions, to waive pleadings, discovery, and briefs. The Board may shorten time periods prescribed or allowed under these Rules as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within the 180-day period.
            (b) Within 30 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of the appellant's notice of election, the assigned Administrative Judge should take the following actions, if feasible, in a pre-hearing conference:
            (1) Identify and simplify the issues;
            (2) Establish a simplified procedure, including discovery, appropriate to the particular appeal involved;
            (3) Determine whether either party elects a hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefor; and
            (4) Establish an accelerated schedule for the timely resolution of the appeal.
            (c) Written decisions by the Board in appeals processed under the Accelerated procedure will normally be short and contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the Board by a single Administrative Judge with the concurrence of a Vice Chairman, or by a majority among these two and the Chairman in case of disagreement.
            12.4 Motions for Reconsideration in Rule 12 Appeals
            Motions for reconsideration of appeals decided under either the Small Claims (Expedited) procedure or the Accelerated procedure need not be decided within the original 120-day or 180-day limit, but all such motions will be processed and decided promptly so as to be consistent with the intent of this Rule.
            Rule 13. Settling the Record in Appeals With a Hearing
            (a) The record upon which the Board's decision will be rendered consists of the documents admitted under Rule 4, the documents admitted into evidence as hearing exhibits, together with the hearing transcript. The Board may designate with notice to the parties, any document to be made part of the record.
            (b) As appropriate, the Board may also rely on pleadings, pre-hearing conference memoranda, orders, briefs, stipulations, and other documents contained in the Board's file.
            (c) Except as the Board may otherwise order, no evidence will be received after completion of an oral hearing.
            (d) The weight to be given to any evidence will rest within the discretion of the Board. The Board may require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.
            (e) The record will at all reasonable times be available for inspection by the parties at the offices of the Board.
            Rule 14. Briefs
            (a) Pre-Hearing Briefs—The Board may require the parties to submit pre-hearing briefs. If the Board does not require pre-hearing briefs, either party may, upon appropriate and sufficient notice to the other party, furnish a pre-hearing brief to the Board.
            (b) Post-Hearing Briefs—Post-hearing briefs may be submitted upon such terms as may be directed by the presiding Administrative Judge or examiner at the conclusion of the hearing.
            Rule 15. Representation
            (a) An individual appellant may represent his or her interests before the Board; a corporation may be represented by one of its officers; and a partnership or joint venture by one of its members; or any of these by an attorney at law duly licensed in any state, commonwealth, territory, the District of Columbia, or in a foreign country. Anyone representing an appellant shall file a written notice of appearance with the Board.
            (b) The Government shall be represented by counsel. Counsel for the Government shall file a written notice of appearance with the Board.
            Rule 16. Sanctions
            If any party fails to obey an order issued by the Board, the Board may impose such sanctions as it considers necessary to the just and expeditious conduct of the appeal.
            Rule 17. Dismissal or Default for Failure to Prosecute or Defend

            Whenever the record discloses the failure of either party to file documents required by these Rules, respond to notices or correspondence from the Board, comply with orders of the Board, or otherwise indicates an intention not to continue the prosecution or defense of an appeal, the Board may, in the case of a default by the appellant, issue an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed with prejudice for failure to prosecute. In the case of a default by the Government, the Board may issue an order to show cause why the Board should not act thereon pursuant to Rule 16. If good cause is not shown, the Board may take appropriate action.
            
            Rule 18. Suspensions; Dismissal Without Prejudice
            (a) The Board may suspend the proceedings by agreement of the parties for settlement discussions, or for good cause shown.
            (b) In certain cases, appeals docketed before the Board are required to be placed in a suspense status and the Board is unable to proceed with disposition thereof for reasons not within the control of the Board. Where the suspension has continued, or may continue, for an inordinate length of time, the Board may dismiss such appeals from its docket for a period of time without prejudice to their restoration. Unless either party or the Board moves to reinstate the appeal within the time period set forth in the dismissal order, or if no time period is set forth, within one year from the date of the dismissal order, the dismissal shall be deemed to be with prejudice.
            Rule 19. Decisions
            (a) Decisions of the Board will be made in writing and authenticated copies of the decision will be sent simultaneously to both parties. All orders and decisions, except those as may be required by law to be held confidential, will be available to the public. Decisions of the Board will be made solely upon the record.
            (b) Any monetary award shall be promptly paid.
            (c) In awards that may be paid from the Judgment Fund, 31 U.S.C. 1304, the Recorder will forward the required forms to each party with the decision. If the parties do not contemplate an appeal or motion for reconsideration, they will execute the forms indicating that no judicial review will be sought. The Government agency will forward the required forms with a copy of the decision to the Department of the Treasury for certification of payment.
            (d) When the parties settle an appeal in favor of the appellant, they may file with the Board a stipulation setting forth the amount of the settlement due to the appellant. By joint motion, the parties may request that the Board issue a decision in the nature of a consent judgment, awarding the stipulated amount to the appellant. These decisions will be processed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Rule.
            (e) After a decision has become final the Board may, upon request of a party and after notice to the other party, grant the withdrawal of original exhibits, or any part thereof. The Board may require the substitution of true copies of exhibits or any part thereof as a condition of granting permission for such withdrawal.
            Rule 20. Motion for Reconsideration
            A motion for reconsideration may be filed by either party. It shall set forth specifically the grounds relied upon to grant the motion. The motion must be filed within 30 days from the date of the receipt of a copy of the decision of the Board by the party filing the motion. An opposing party must file any cross-motion for reconsideration within 30 days from its receipt of the motion for reconsideration. Extensions in the period to file a motion will not be granted. Extensions to file a memorandum in support of a timely-filed motion may be granted.
            Rule 21. Remand from Court
            Whenever any Court remands an appeal to the Board for further proceedings, each of the parties shall, within 30 days of receipt of such remand, submit a report to the Board recommending procedures to be followed so as to comply with the Court's remand. The Board will consider the reports and enter an order governing the remanded appeal.
            Rule 22. Subpoenas
            (a) Voluntary Cooperation—Each party is expected:
            (1) To cooperate and make available witnesses and evidence under its control as requested by the other party without issuance of a subpoena, and
            (2) To secure voluntary attendance of desired third-party witnesses and production of desired third-party books, records, documents, or tangible things whenever possible.
            (b) General—Upon written request of either party, or on his or her own initiative, an Administrative Judge may issue a subpoena requiring:
            (1) Testimony at a deposition—The deposing of a witness in the city or county where the witness resides or is employed or transacts business in person, or at another location convenient for the witness that is specifically determined by the Board;
            (2) Testimony at a hearing—The attendance of a witness for the purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and
            (3) Production of books and records—The production by the witness at the deposition or hearing of books and records (including electronically stored information and other tangible things) designated in the subpoena.
            (c) Request for Subpoena—
            (1) A request for subpoena shall normally be filed at least:
            (i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a witness at a deposition is sought; or
            (ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a witness at a hearing is sought.
            (2) The Board may honor a request for subpoena not made within the time limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this Rule.

            (3) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books and records sought. The Board may require resubmission of a request that does not provide this information.
            (d) Requests to Quash or Modify—Upon written request by the person subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, the Board may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable or oppressive or for other good cause shown, or require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where circumstances require, the Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy of the request has been served upon the opposing party.
            (e) Form of Subpoena—
            (1) Every subpoena shall state the name of the Board and the caption of the appeal, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified books and records at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the Administrative Judge will sign the subpoena, enter the name of the witness and may otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.
            (2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter rogatory may be issued and served under the circumstances and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781.
            (f) Service—
            (1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for service.
            (2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing may be served in any state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. A subpoena may be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law. However, where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government, payment need not be tendered in advance of attendance.
            (3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for striking such evidence as the Board deems appropriate.
            (g) Contumacy or Refusal to Obey a Subpoena—In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District Court, the Board may apply to the Court through the Attorney General of the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the Board to give testimony or produce evidence or both. Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be punished by the Court as a contempt thereof.
            Rule 23. Ex Parte Communications
            No member of the Board or of the Board's staff shall entertain, nor shall any person directly or indirectly involved in an appeal, submit to the Board or the Board's staff, ex parte, any evidence, explanation, analysis, or advice, whether written or oral, regarding any matter at issue in an appeal. This Rule does not apply to consultation among Board members or its staff or to ex parte communications concerning the Board's administrative functions or procedures.

Unless the Government requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (2) below, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated by the Board at its discretion as a general denial to the application on behalf of the Government.
            (2) If the Government and the applicant believe that the matters raised in the application can be resolved by mutual agreement, they may jointly file a statement of intent to negotiate a settlement. Filing of this statement will extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days. Further extensions may be requested by the parties.
            (3) The answer will explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied upon in support of the Government's position.
            (4) An original and one copy of the answer should be filed with the Board. The Government will forward one copy to the applicant.
            (k) Reply—Within 15 days after receipt of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. An original and one copy of the reply will be filed with the Board. The applicant will forward one copy to the Government.
            (l) Award proceedings—

            (1) The Board may enter an order prescribing the procedure to be followed or take such other action as may be deemed appropriate under the EAJA. Further proceedings will be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application.
            
            (2) A request that the Board order further proceedings under this paragraph will describe the disputed issues, explain why the additional proceedings are deemed necessary to resolve the issues and specifically identify any information sought and its relationship to the disputed issues.
            (m) Evidence—
            (1) Decisions on the merits—When a CDA appeal is decided on the merits, other than by a consent judgment, the record relating to whether the Government's position under the EAJA was substantially justified will be limited to the record in the CDA appeal. Evidence relevant to other issues in the award proceeding may be submitted.
            (2) Other dispositions—When a CDA appeal is settled, or decided by a consent judgment, either party in proceedings under the EAJA may, for good cause shown, supplement the record established in the CDA appeal with affidavits and other supporting evidence relating to whether the position of the agency was substantially justified or other issues in the award proceeding.
            (n) Decision—Decisions under the EAJA will be rendered by the Administrative Judge or a majority of the judges who would have participated in a motion for reconsideration of the underlying CDA appeal. The decision of the Board will include written findings and conclusions and the basis therefor. The Board's decision on an application for fees and other expenses under the EAJA will be the final administrative decision regarding the EAJA application.
            (o) Motions for reconsideration—Either party may file a motion for reconsideration. Motions for reconsideration must be filed within 30 days of receipt of the Board's EAJA decision. Extensions in the period to file a motion will not be granted. Extensions to file a memorandum in support of a timely filed motion may be granted.
            (p) Payment of Awards—The Board's EAJA awards will be paid directly by the contracting agency over which the applicant prevailed in the underlying CDA appeal.
            ADDENDUM II
            Alternative Methods of Dispute Resolution
            1. The Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 U.S.C. 7105(g)(1), states that boards of contract appeals “shall . . . to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes.” Resolution of a dispute at the earliest stage feasible, by the fastest and least expensive method possible, benefits both parties. To that end, the parties are encouraged to consider Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures for pre-claim and pre-final decision matters, as well as appeals pending before the Board. The Board may also conduct ADRs for any Federal agency. However, if the matter is not pending before the Board under its CDA jurisdiction, any settlement may not be paid out of the Judgment Fund.
            2. The ADR methods described in this Addendum are intended to suggest techniques that have worked in the past. Any appropriate method that brings the parties together in settlement, or partial settlement, of their disputes is a good method. The ADR methods listed are not intended to preclude the parties' use of other ADR techniques that do not require the Board's participation, such as settlement negotiations, fact-finding conferences or procedures, mediation, or minitrials not involving use of the Board's personnel. Any method, or combination of methods, including one that will result in a binding decision, may be selected by the parties without regard to the dollar amount in dispute.
            3. The parties must jointly request ADR procedures at the Board. The request must be approved by the Board. The Board may also schedule a conference to explore the desirability and selection of an ADR method and related procedures. If an ADR involving the Board's participation is requested and approved by the Board, a Neutral will be appointed. If an Administrative Judge has already been assigned to an appeal, the same judge will normally be assigned to be the Neutral in an ADR. If an Administrative Judge has not yet been assigned to the appeal, or if the subject of the ADR is a matter pending before the contracting officer prior to any appeal, the Board will appoint an Administrative Judge to be the Neutral. In such instances, as well as situations in which the parties prefer that an assigned Administrative Judge not be appointed to serve as the Neutral, the parties may submit a list of at least three preferred Administrative Judges and the Board will endeavor to accommodate their preferences.
            4. To facilitate full, frank and open discussion and presentations, any Neutral who has participated in a non-binding ADR procedure that has failed to resolve the underlying dispute will be recused from further participation in the matter unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing and the Board concurs. Further, the recused Neutral will not discuss the merits of the dispute or substantive matters involved in the ADR proceedings with other Board personnel.

            5. Written material prepared specifically for use in an ADR proceeding, oral presentations made at an ADR proceeding, and all discussions in connection with such proceedings between the parties and the Neutral are confidential and, unless otherwise specifically agreed by the parties, inadmissible as evidence in any pending or future Board proceeding involving the parties or matter in dispute. However, evidence otherwise admissible before the Board is not rendered inadmissible because of its use in the ADR proceeding.
            6. The ADR method and the procedures and requirements implementing the ADR method will be prescribed by the written agreement of the parties and approved by the Board. ADR methods can be used successfully at any stage of the litigation.
            7. The following are examples of ADR methods commonly used at the Board:
            (a) Nonbinding—
            Mediations: A Neutral is an Administrative Judge who will not normally hear or have any formal or informal decision-making authority in the matter and who is appointed for the purpose of facilitating settlement. In many circumstances, settlement can be fostered by a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position with the Neutral. The agenda for meetings with the Neutral will be flexible to accommodate the requirements of the case. To further the settlement effort, the Neutral may meet with the parties either jointly or individually. A Neutral's recommendations are not binding on the parties. When this method is selected, the ADR agreement must contain a provision in which the parties and counsel agree not to subpoena the Neutral in any legal action or administrative proceeding of any kind to produce any notes or documents related to the ADR proceeding or to testify concerning any such notes or documents or concerning his/her thoughts or impressions.
            (b) Binding—
            Summary Proceeding With Binding Decision: A summary proceeding with binding decision is a procedure whereby the resolution of the appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an Administrative Judge. A binding “bench” decision may be issued upon conclusion of the proceeding, or a binding summary written decision will be issued by the judge no later than ten days following the later of conclusion of the proceeding or receipt of a transcript. The parties must agree in the ADR agreement that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the Board under this method shall be final, conclusive, not appealable, and may not be set aside, except for fraud. All such decisions, rulings, and orders will have no precedential value. Pre-hearing, hearing, and post-hearing procedures and rules applicable to appeals generally will be modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal.
            (c) Other Agreed Methods—
            The parties and the Board may agree upon other informal methods, binding or nonbinding that are structured and tailored to suit the requirements of the individual case.
            8. The above-listed ADR procedures are intended to shorten and simplify the Board's more formalized procedures. Generally, if the parties resolve their dispute by agreement, they benefit in terms of cost and time savings and maintenance or restoration of amicable relations. The Board will not view the parties' participation in ADR proceedings as a sign of weakness. Any method adopted for dispute resolution depends upon both parties having a firm, good faith commitment to resolve their differences. Absent such intention, the best structured dispute resolution procedure is unlikely to be successful.

            Part 1—Introduction
            F-101 General.
            (a) This appendix contains procedures and instructions for the use, preparation, and distribution of the Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) Receiving Report (RR), WAWF Reparable Receiving Report (WAWF RRR) , the WAWF Energy RR, and commercial shipping/packing lists used to document Government contract quality assurance. The WAWF RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report (MIRR). The WAWF Energy RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for overland shipments and DD Form 250-1, Tanker/Barge Material Inspection and Receiving Report, for waterborne shipments. The WAWF RRR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for repair, maintenance, or overhaul of Government-furnished property.
            (b) The use of the DD Form 250 series documents is on an exception basis (see DFARS 232.7002(a)) because use of the WAWF RR is now required by most DoD contracts. WAWF provides for electronic preparation and documentation of acceptance of supplies and services, and electronic invoicing. In addition WAWF allows the printing of a RR that can be used as a packing list or when a signed copy is required.
            F-102 Applicability.
            (a) DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, requires payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF in nearly all cases.
            (b) When DoD provides quality assurance or acceptance services for non-DoD activities, prepare a MIRR using the instructions in this appendix, unless otherwise specified in the contract.
            F-103 Use.
            (a) The WAWF RR, WAWF RRR and the DD Form 250 are multipurpose reports used—
            (1) To provide evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin or destination;
            (2) To provide evidence of acceptance at origin, destination, or other;
            (3) For packing lists;
            (4) For receiving;
            (5) For shipping;
            (6) As a contractor invoice (the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR or DD Form 250 alone cannot be used as an invoice, however the option exists to create an invoice from the Receiving Report or a Combo (Invoice and Receiving Report) both of which minimize data entry); and
            (7) As commercial invoice support.
            (b) Do not use the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR or the DD Form 250 for shipments—
            (1) By subcontractors, unless the subcontractor is shipping directly to the Government; or

            (2) Of contract inventory. The WAWF Property Transfer document should be used for this type of shipment. Training for the preparation of this document type is available at https://wawftraining.eb.mil, under the Property Transfer and Receipt section.
            (c) The contractor prepares the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR or the DD Form 250, except for entries that an authorized Government representative is required to complete. When using a paper DD Form 250, the contractor shall furnish sufficient copies of the completed form, as directed by the Government representative.
            (d) Use the WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1:
            (1) For bulk movements of petroleum products by tanker or barge to cover—
            (i) Origin or destination acceptance of cargo; or
            (ii) Shipment or receipt of Government owned products.
            (2) To send quality data to the point of acceptance in the case of origin inspection on FOB destination deliveries or preinspection at product source. Annotate the forms with the words “INSPECTED FOR QUALITY ONLY.”
            (e) In addition to the above uses, the WAWF RR and WAWF RRR provide additional functionality, not provided by the paper DD Form 250 that complies with the following requirements:
            (1) Item Unique Identification (IUID), when the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Unique Identification and Valuation is used in the contract, reporting of IUID data is required. WAWF captures the IUID data and forwards the data to the IUID registry after acceptance. WAWF shall be used to report Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs) at the line item level, unless an exception to WAWF applies, and can also be used to report UIIs embedded at the line item level.
            (2) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), when the clause at DFARS 252.211-7006, Radio Frequency Identification, is used in the contract, WAWF will capture the RFID information and forward the data to the receiving location. Using WAWF is the only way a contractor can comply with the clause to furnish RFID data via an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN). The RFID information may be added at time of submission, or via the WAWF Pack Later functionality after acceptance.

            (3) Reporting of Government-furnished property, when the clause at DFARS 252.211-7007, Reporting of Government-Furnished Property, is used in the contract, use of the WAWF RRR will capture the shipment of Government-furnished property items after acceptance of repair services and forward the data to the IUID registry. WAWF is the only way a contractor can report the transfer of Government-furnished property items in the IUID registry.
            F-104 Application.
            (a) WAWF RR and DD Form 250. (1) Use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for delivery of contract line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, which indicate no DD Form 250 is required.
            (2) If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance and acceptance data are the same for more than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, contractors may prepare one WAWF RR or DD Form 250 to cover all such shipments.
            (3) If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for the contents of each vehicle.
            (4) When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the shipment includes items of more than one Federal supply class (FSC) or material management code (MMC), prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for items of each of the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant Government representative may authorize a single WAWF RR or DD Form 250, listing each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate continuation sheet. The MMC appears as a suffix to the national stock number applicable to the item.
            (5) Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD Form 250.
            
            (i) Contiguous United States. Contractors may consolidate multiple car or truck load shipments of petroleum made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line item, on one WAWF RR or DD Form 250. To permit verification of motor deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250. Include a shipping document (commercial or Government) with each individual load showing as a minimum—
            (A) The shipper;
            (B) Shipping point;
            (C) Consignee;
            (D) Contract and line item number;
            (E) Product identification;
            (F) Gross gallons (bulk only);
            (G) Loading temperature (bulk only);
            (H) American Petroleum Institute gravity (bulk only);
            (I) Identification of carrier's equipment;
            (J) Serial number of all seals applied; and
            (K) Signature of supplier's representative.
            
            When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity retains the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250 forwarded by the contractor (reference F-401, Table 1) before signing Block 21b.
            (ii) Overseas. The same criteria as for contiguous United States applies, except the consolidation period may be extended, if acceptable to the receiving activity, shipping activity, Government finance office, and the authorized Government representative having cognizance at the contractor's facility. In addition, the contractor may include more than one contract line item in each WAWF RR or DD Form 250 if the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance, and acceptance data are the same for all line items.
            (6) Consolidation of Coal Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD 250. Contractors may consolidate multiple railcar or truck shipments of coal made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line items, on one WAWF RR or DD 250. To permit verification of truck deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. Include a commercial shipping document with each individual truck load showing as a minimum—
            (i) The shipper;
            (ii) The name or names;
            (iii) Location and shipping point of the mine or mines from which the coal originates;
            (iv) The contract number;
            (v) The exact size of the coal shipped; and

            (vi) A certified weighmaster's certification of weight for the truckload.
            
            Include a waybill with each rail shipment showing the identical information. To permit verification of rail deliveries, identify each railcar number comprising the shipment to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250 and the analytical test report. When acceptance is at destination, the receiving activity must retain the shipping document(s) to verify the entries on the consignee copy of the DD Form 250.
            (b) WAWF RRR or DD Form 250. Use as in paragraph (a) of this section for delivery of services for repair, overhaul, or maintenance.
            (c) WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1. (1) Use a separate form for each tanker or barge cargo loaded.
            (2) The contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if on the same contract and consigned to the same destination.
            (3) When liftings involve more than one contract, prepare separate forms to cover the portion of cargo loaded on each contract.

            (4) Prepare a separate form for each product or grade of product loaded.
            
            (5) Use a separate document for each tanker or barge cargo and each grade of product discharged.
            (6) For discharge, the contractor may report more than one barge in the same tow on a single form if from the same loading source.
            Part 2—Contract Quality Assurance on Shipments Between Contractors
            F-201 Procedures
            Follow the procedures at PGI F-201 for evidence of required Government contract quality assurance at a subcontractor's facility.
            Part 3—Preparation of the Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) Receiving Report (WAWF RRR), and WAWF Energy RR
            F-301 Preparation instructions.
            (a) General. (1) Preparation instructions and training for the WAWF RR are available at https://wawftraining.eb.mil. The instructions on preparing a WAWF RR are part of the Vendor Training section.
            (2) Prime contractors can direct subcontractors to prepare and submit documents in WAWF by giving their subcontractors access to WAWF via the creation of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) extension to the prime CAGE.
            (3) If the contract is in Electronic Data Access (EDA) (DoD's contract repository), then the WAWF system will automatically populate all available and applicable contract data.
            (i) When source acceptance is required, WAWF will populate the “Inspect By” with the “Admin by” Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC). The vendor shall change the DoDAAC if Government Source Inspection (GSI) is performed at other than the “Admin By.”
            (ii) Any fields that have been pre-filled may be changed.
            (iii) WAWF will also verify that CAGE codes are valid and active in the System for Award Management (SAM), and that DoDAACs and Military Assistance Program Address Codes (MAPACs) are valid in Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS).
            (4) WAWF will populate the address information for CAGE codes, DODAACs, and MAPACs from SAM and DAAS. These sites are the DoD definitive sources for address information. Any fields that have been pre-filled may be changed or additional information added.
            (5) Do not include classified information in WAWF.
            (b) Completion instructions.(1) Contract no/delivery order no.
            (i) For stand-alone contracts, enter the 13-position alpha-numeric basic Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID) of the contract. For task and delivery orders numbered in accordance with FAR 4.1603 and DFARS 204.1603, enter the 13-character order number. The contract or agreement number under which the order was placed may be omitted from the WAWF RR. Alternatively, the contractor may choose to enter the contract number on the WAWF RR in addition to the 13-character order number. If the order has only a four-position alpha-numeric call or order serial number, enter both the 13-position basic contract PIID and the four-position order number.
            (ii) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this appendix, do not enter supplementary numbers used in conjunction with basic PIIDs to identify—
            (A) Modifications of contracts and agreements;
            (B) Modifications to calls or orders; or
            (C) Document numbers representing contracts written between contractors.
            (iii) When shipping instructions are furnished and shipment is made before receipt of the confirming contract modification (SF 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract), enter a comment in the Misc. Info Tab to this effect. This will appear in the Comments section of the printed WAWF RR.
            (2) Shipment No.

            (i) The shipment number format requires first three data positions to be alpha, fourth position alpha-numeric and last three positions numeric, e.g., DFAR001 or DAR0001. Any document used as a packing list must include the shipment number information.
            (A) The prime contractor shall control and assign the shipment number prefix. The shipment number shall consist of three alphabetic characters for each “Shipped From” address. The shipment number prefix shall be different for each “Shipped From” address and shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract. The prime contractor may assign separate prefixes when shipments are made from different locations within a facility identified by one “Shipped From” address.
            (B) Number the first shipment 0001 for shipments made under the contract or contract and order number from each “Shipped From” address, or shipping location within the “Shipped From” address. Consecutively number all subsequent shipments with the identical shipment number prefix. While shipments should be created sequentially they can be released and accepted out of sequence.
            (1) Use alpha-numeric serial numbers when more than 9,999 numbers are required. Serially assign alpha-numeric numbers with the alpha in the first position (the letters I and O shall not be used) followed by the three-position numeric serial number. Use the following alpha-numeric sequence:
            
            A000 through A999 (10,000 through 10,999)
            B000 through B999 (11,000 through 11,999)
            Z000 through Z999 (34,000 through 34,999)
            
            
            (2) When this series is completely used, the shipment number prefix will have to be changed when the series is completely used. WAWF will not allow duplicate shipment numbers to be created against a contract or contract and delivery order.
            (ii) Reassign the shipment number of the initial shipment where a “Replacement Shipment” is involved (see paragraph (b)(16)(iv)(F) of this appendix).
            (iii) The prime contractor shall control deliveries and on the final shipment of the contract shall end the shipment number with a “Z.” Where the final shipment is from other than the prime contractor's plant, the prime contractor may elect either to—
            (A) Direct the subcontractor making the final shipment to end that shipment number with a “Z”; or
            (B) Upon determination that all subcontractors have completed their shipments, to correct the DD Form 250 (see F-304) covering the final shipment made from the prime contractor's plant by addition of a “Z” to that shipment number.
            (iv) Contractors follow the procedures in F-305 to use commercial invoices.
            (3) Date shipped. Enter the date the shipment is released to the carrier or the date the services are completed. If the shipment will be released after the date of contract quality assurance and/or acceptance, enter the estimated date of release. When the date is estimated, enter an “E” or select an “E” from the drop down menu in the “Estimated” block after the date. Do not delay submission of the WAWF RR for lack of entry of the actual shipping date. Correction of the WAWF RR is not required to show the actual shipping date (see F-303). Once the document is submitted the shipment date cannot be changed.
            (4) B/L TCN. When applicable, enter—
            (i) The commercial or Government bill of lading number after “B/L;” WAWF provides the capability to separately and correctly identify the Government Bill of Lading (GBL) from a Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL). An authorized user will select whether the entered bill of lading number is either a GBL number or a CBL number.
            (ii) The transportation control number must be a 17 alpha/numeric digit min/max field, and WAWF provides the capability to enter two secondary transportation tracking numbers.
            (5) Line haul mode. Select the Line Haul Mode of Shipment code from a drop down menu in WAWF.
            (6) Inspection and acceptance point. Enter an “S” for Origin or “D” for Destination. In addition to “S” and “D,” WAWF allows acceptance at Other (O). For purposes of conforming to contract, “O” is equivalent to “D”. In WAWF, destination acceptance is performed by the “Ship to” DODAAC organization and “Other” permits the acceptance of destination documents at a location other than the “Ship to.” The goods or services will be shipped to one location and the paperwork will be routed to another location for the actual acceptance.
            (7) Prime contractor/code. Enter the prime CAGE code to which the contract was awarded.
            (8) Administered by/code. Enter the DoDAAC code of the contract administration office cited in the contract.

            (11) Payment will be made by/code. Enter the DoDAAC code of the payment office cited in the contract.
            (12) Shipped to/code. Enter the DoDAAC, MAPAC, or CAGE code from the contract or shipping instructions.
            (13) Marked for/code. Enter the code from the contract or shipping instructions. Only valid DoDAACs, MAPACs, or CAGE codes can be entered.

            (B) In the description field, if required by the contract for control purposes, enter: The make, model, serial number, lot, batch, hazard indicator, or similar description.
            (C) The Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) must be placed on the MILSTRIP Tab, not in the line item description field. Enter the MILSTRIP data for each CLIN when MILSTRIP data is identified in the contract.
            (ii) For service line items, select SV for “SERVICE” in the type field followed by as short a description as is possible in the description field.

            “Note: Acceptance and payment are contingent upon receipt of approved test/evaluation results.”
            The contracting officer will advise—
            (1) The consignee of the results (approval/disapproval); and
            (2) The contractor to withhold invoicing pending attachment of the approved test/evaluation results.
            (M) For clothing and textile contracts containing a bailment clause, enter the words “GFP UNIT VALUE.”

            (N) When the initial unit incorporating an approved value engineering change proposal (VECP) is shipped, enter the following statement:

Authorized abbreviations are listed in MIL-STD-129, Marking for Shipping and Storage and in the WAWF Unit of Measure Table Link. For example, LB for pound, SH for sheet.
            (18) Unit price. When using the WAWF RRR, the unit price is the price of the repair, overhaul, or maintenance service from the contract.
            (i) The contractor may, at its option, enter unit prices on the WAWF RR, except when the contract has IUID requirements and the receiving report is being processed in WAWF, the unit price must represent the acquisition cost that will be recorded in the IUID registry. Therefore, in such cases, the unit price is required. See DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Unique Identification and Valuation).
            (ii) The contractor shall enter unit prices for each item of property fabricated or acquired for the Government and delivered to a contractor as Government furnished property (GFP).

When the price is estimated, enter “Estimated Unit Price” in the description field. When delivering GFP via WAWF to another contractor, WAWF will initiate a property transfer if the vendor who is initiating the WAWF RR is also registered as a vendor property shipper in WAWF and the vendor receiving the property is also a vendor property receiver in WAWF.
            (iii) For clothing and textile contracts containing a bailment clause, enter the cited Government furnished property unit value as “GFP UNIT VALUE” in the description field.

Enter notes taking exception in Misc. Info Tab comment field or on attached supporting documents with an appropriate block cross-reference.
            (ii) When a shipment is authorized under an alternative release procedure, contractors will execute the alternative release procedure in WAWF by including the appropriate indicator in the electronic transaction rather than through inclusion or attachment of the text of the certificate. The alternative release procedure only provides for release of shipment; Government acceptance must still be indicated by a Government official's signature on the WAWF RR.
            (iii) When contract terms provide for use of Certificate of Conformance and shipment is made under these terms, contractors will execute Certificates in WAWF by including the appropriate indicator in the electronic transaction rather than through inclusion or attachment of the text of the certificate.

            F-306 Packing List Instructions
            (a) Contractors may use a WAWF processed RR or the WAWF RRR, as a packing list. WAWF provides an option to print the RR or RRR. Contractors can print a RR or RRR from a system other than WAWF if a signed copy is required. In such cases, the contractor shall print the WAWF RR or RRR only after a signature is applied by the Government inspector or authorized acceptor in WAWF. Copies printed from the contractor's system shall be annotated with “\\original signed in WAWF\\” in lieu of the inspector or acceptor's signature. Ensure a copy is visible on the outside and one is placed inside the package.
            (b) If the contract requires Government source inspection and acceptance at origin, the contractor shall ensure that its packaging documentation includes a RR or RRR that documents inspection, acceptance, or both by the Government inspector or authorized acceptor. A paper DD Form 250 may be used in lieu of WAWF generated RRs or RRRs when one of the exceptions in paragraph (d) of the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003 applies.

            F-406 Invoice instructions.
            (a) Contractors shall submit payment requests and receiving reports in electronic form, unless an exception in DFARS 232.7002 applies. Contractor submission of the material inspection and receiving information required by this appendix by using the WAWF electronic form (see paragraph (b) of the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003) fulfills the requirement for an MIRR.
            (b) If the contracting officer authorizes the contractor to submit an invoice in paper form, the Government encourages, but does not require, the contractor to use the MIRR as an invoice, in lieu of a commercial form. If commercial forms are used, identify the related MIRR shipment number(s) on the form. If using the MIRR as an invoice, prepare the MIRR and forward the required number of copies to the payment office as follows:
            (1) Complete Blocks 5, 6, 19, and 20. Block 6 shall contain the invoice number and date. Column 20 shall be totaled.

            (2) Mark in letters approximately one inch high, first copy: “ORIGINAL INVOICE,” for all invoice submissions; and three copies: “INVOICE COPY,” when the payment office requires four copies. Questions regarding the appropriate number of copies (i.e., one or four) should be directed to the applicable payment office.
            (3) Forward the appropriate number of copies to the payment office (Block 12 address), except when acceptance is at destination and a Navy finance office will make payment, forward to destination.
            (4) Separate the copies of the MIRR used as an invoice from the copies of the MIRR used as a receiving report.
            F-407 Packing list instructions.
            Contractors may use copies of the MIRR as a packing list. The packing list copies are in addition to the copies of the MIRR required for standard distribution (see F-501). Mark them “PACKING LIST.”
            F-408 Receiving instructions.

            When the MIRR is used for receiving purposes, local directives shall prescribe procedures. If CQA and acceptance or acceptance of supplies is required upon arrival at destination, see F-401(b)(21)(v) for instructions.

            H-101 Notification.

              Authority:
              41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR chapter 1.
            
            H-100 Scope.
            This appendix provides uniform debarment and suspension procedures to be followed by all debarring and suspending officials.
            H-101 Notification.
            Contractors will be notified of the proposed debarment or suspension in accordance with FAR 9.406-3 or 9.407-3. A copy of the record which formed the basis for the decision by the debarring and suspending official will be made available to the contractor. If there is a reason to withhold from the contractor any portion of the record, the contractor will be informed of what is withheld and the reasons for such withholding.
            H-102 Nature of proceeding.
            There are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the suspension or debarment process. The first is the presentation of matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the contractor.
            The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the contractor's presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon a conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-filling proceeding concerning the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent that the proposed action stems from the contractor's affiliation with an individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.
            H-103 Presentation of matters in opposition.
            (a) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in opposition may be presented in person, in writing, or through a representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any combination of the foregoing methods, but if a contractor desires to present matters in person or through a representative, any written material should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and suspending official or designee to provide information as to the contractor's present responsibility.

            (b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial in nature. The debarring and suspending official and/or other agency representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its representative making the presentation. The contractor may select the individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor's behalf; individual respondents or principals of a business firm respondent may attend and speak for themselves.
            (c) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor may submit matters in opposition within 30 days from receipt of the notice of suspension or proposed debarment.
            (d) The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment includes the opportunity to present matters concerning the duration of the debarment.
            H-104 Fact-finding.
            (a) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the contractor's presentation has raised a genuine dispute of material fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against debarment or continued suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-finding proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the debarring and suspending official.
            (b) The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 working days of the contractor's presentation of matters in opposition. An official record will be made of the fact-finding proceeding.
            (c) The Government's representative and the contractor will have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issues. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative in the fact-finding proceeding.
            (d) Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.
            (e) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceeding and that any false testimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination.
            H-105 Timing requirements.
            All timing requirements set forth in these procedures may be extended by the debarring and suspending official for good cause.
            H-106 Subsequent to fact-finding.
            (a) Written findings of fact will be prepared by the fact-finder as mandated by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)(i).
            (b) The fact-finder will determine the disputed fact(s) by a preponderance of the evidence. A copy of the findings of fact will be provided to the debarring and suspending official, the Government's representative, and the contractor.
            (c) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether to continue the suspension or to debar the contractor based upon the entire administrative record, including the findings of fact.
            (d) Prompt written notice of the debarring and suspending official's decision will be sent to the contractor and any affiliates involved, in compliance with FAR 9.406-3(e) and 9.407-3(d)(4).

            (b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protégé agreements with eligible protégé firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protégé firms to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. DoD may provide the mentor firm with either cost reimbursement or credit against applicable subcontracting goals established under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies.
            (c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the extent to which the Program results in—

            (1) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract awards to protégé firms (under DoD contracts, contracts awarded by other Federal agencies, and commercial contracts) from the date of their entry into the Program until 2 years after the conclusion of the agreement;
            (2) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to a protégé firm (or former protégé firm) by its mentor firm (or former mentor firm);
            (3) An increase in the employment level of protégé firms from the date of entry into the Program until 2 years after the completion of the agreement.
            (d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving—
            (1) Reimbursement through a separate contract line item in a DoD contract or a separate contract with DoD; or
            (2) Credit toward applicable subcontracting goals for costs incurred under the Program.

            (d) For purposes of the Small Business Act, no determination of affiliation or control (either direct or indirect) may be found between a protégé firm and its mentor firm on the basis that the mentor firm has agreed to furnish (or has furnished) to its protégé firm, pursuant to a mentor-protégé agreement, any form of developmental assistance described in I-106(d).
            (e) A protégé firm may not be a party to more than one DoD mentor-protégé agreement at a time, and may only participate in the Program during the 5-year period beginning on the date the protégé firm enters into its first mentor-protégé agreement.

            (c) A template of the mentor application is available at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/sb/programs/mpp/resources.shtml.
            (d) Companies that apply for participation and are not approved will be provided the reasons and an opportunity to submit additional information for reconsideration.
            I-106 Development of mentor-protégé agreements.
            (a) Prospective mentors and their protégés may choose to execute letters of intent prior to negotiation of mentor-protégé agreements.
            (b) The agreements should be structured after completion of a preliminary assessment of the developmental needs of the protégé firm and mutual agreement regarding the developmental assistance to be provided to address those needs and enhance the protégé's ability to perform successfully under contracts or subcontracts.
            (c) A mentor firm may not require a protégé firm to enter into a mentor-protégé agreement as a condition for award of a contract by the mentor firm, including a subcontract under a DoD contract awarded to the mentor firm.
            (d) The mentor-protégé agreement may provide for the mentor firm to furnish any or all of the following types of developmental assistance:
            (1) Assistance by mentor firm personnel in—
            (i) General business management, including organizational management, financial management, and personnel management, marketing, and overall business planning;
            (ii) Engineering and technical matters such as production inventory control and quality assurance; and
            (iii) Any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protégé firm under the developmental program described in I-107(g).
            (2) Award of subcontracts to the protégé firmunder DoD contracts or other contracts on a noncompetitive basis.
            (3) Payment of progress payments for the performance of subcontracts by a protégé firm in amounts as provided for in the subcontract; but in no event may any such progress payment exceed 100 percent of the costs incurred by the protégé firm for the performance of the subcontract. Provision of progress payments by a mentor firm to a protégé firm at a rate other than the customary rate for the firm must be implemented in accordance with FAR 32.504(c).
            (4) Advance payments under such subcontracts. The mentor firm must administer advance payments in accordance with FAR Subpart 32.4.
            (5) Loans.
            (6) Assistance that the mentor firm obtains for the protégé firm from one or more of the following:
            (i) Small Business Development Centers established pursuant to section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648).
            (ii) Entities providing procurement technical assistance pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Chapter 142 (Procurement Technical Assistance Centers).
            (iii) Historically Black colleges and universities.
            (iv) Minority institutions of higher education.
            (v) Women's business centers described in section 29 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656).

            (e) Pursuant to FAR 31.109, approved mentor firms seeking either reimbursement or credit are strongly encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with the contracting officer responsible for determining final indirect cost rates under FAR 42.705. The purpose of the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs of the developmental assistance pursuant to the mentor-protégé agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute based on questions related to reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such costs and to address the need for any changes to their cost accounting practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-protégé agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether costs will be reimbursed or credited.
            (f) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protégé agreement is distinct from, and must not duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm's subcontracts. Costs associated with the latter must be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor's approved accounting practices; they are not considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or reimbursement under the Program.
            I-107 Elements of a mentor-protégé agreement.

            (l) Procedures for the mentor firm to notify the protégé firm in writing at least 30 days in advance of the mentor firm's intent to voluntarily withdraw its participation in the Program.

Otherwise, a mentor firm must terminate a mentor-protégé agreement for cause;
            
            (m) Procedures for the mentor firm to terminate the mentor-protégé agreement for cause which provide that—
            (1) The mentor firm must furnish the protégé firm a written notice of the proposed termination, stating the specific reasons for such action, at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of such proposed termination;

            (2) A signed mentor-protégé agreement pursuant to I-107;
            (3) A statement as to whether the mentor is seeking credit or reimbursement of costs incurred;
            (4) The estimated cost of the technical assistance to be provided, broken out per year;
            (5) A justification if program participation term is greater than 3 years (Term of agreements may not exceed 5 years); and

            I-109 Reimbursable agreements.
            The following program provisions apply to all reimbursable mentor-protégé agreements:
            (a) Assistance provided in the form of progress payments to a protégé firm in excess of the customary progress payment rate for the firm will be reimbursed only if implemented in accordance with FAR 32.504(c).
            (b) Assistance provided in the form of advance payments will be reimbursed only if the payments have been provided to a protégé firm under subcontract terms and conditions similar to those in the clause at FAR 52.232-12, Advance Payments. Reimbursement of any advance payments will be made pursuant to the inclusion of the clause at DFARS 252.232-7005, Reimbursement of Subcontractor Advance Payments—DoD Pilot Mentor-Protégé Program, in appropriate contracts. In requesting reimbursement, the mentor firm agrees that the risk of any financial loss due to the failure or inability of a protégé firm to repay any unliquidated advance payments will be the sole responsibility of the mentor firm.
            (c) The primary forms of developmental assistance authorized for reimbursement under the Program are identified in I-106(d). On a case-by-case basis, Component Directors, SBP, at their discretion, may approve additional incidental expenses for reimbursement, provided these expenses do not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated cost of the agreement.
            (d) The total amount reimbursed to a mentor firm for costs of assistance furnished to a protégé firm in a fiscal year may not exceed $1,000,000 unless the cognizant Component Director, SBP, determines in writing that unusual circumstances justify reimbursement at a higher amount. Request for authority to reimburse in excess of $1,000,000 must detail the unusual circumstances and must be endorsed and submitted by the program manager to the cognizant Component Director, SBP.

            (e) DoD may not reimburse any fee to the mentor firm for services provided to the protégé firm pursuant to I-106(d)(6) or for business development expenses incurred by the mentor firm under a contract awarded to the mentor firm while participating in a joint venture with the protégé firm.
            (f) Developmental assistance costs that are incurred pursuant to an approved reimbursable mentor-protégé agreement, and have been charged to, but not reimbursed through, a separate contract, or through a separately priced contract line item added to a DoD contract, will not be otherwise reimbursed, as either a direct or indirect cost, under any other DoD contract, irrespective of whether the costs have been recognized for credit against applicable subcontracting goals.
            I-110 Credit agreements.
            I-110.1 Program provisions applicable to credit agreements.
            (a) Developmental assistance costs incurred by a mentor firm for providing assistance to a protégé firm pursuant to an approved credit mentor-protégé agreement may be credited as if the costs were incurred under a subcontract award to that protégé, for the purpose of determining the performance of the mentor firm in attaining an applicable subcontracting goal established under any contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, or the provisions of the DoD Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans . Unreimbursed developmental assistance costs incurred for a protégé firm that is an eligible entity employing severely disabled individuals may be credited toward the mentor firm's small disadvantaged business subcontracting goal, even if the protégé firm is not a small disadvantaged business concern.
            (b) Costs that have been reimbursed through inclusion in indirect expense pools may also be credited as subcontract awards for determining the performance of the mentor firm in attaining an applicable subcontracting goal established under any contract containing a subcontracting plan. However, costs that have not been reimbursed because they are not reasonable, allocable, or allowable will not be recognized for crediting purposes.
            (c) Other costs that are not eligible for reimbursement pursuant to I-106(d) may be recognized for credit only if requested, identified, and incorporated in an approved mentor-protégé agreement.
            (d) The amount of credit a mentor firm may receive for any such unreimbursed developmental assistance costs must be equal to—
            (1) Four times the total amount of such costs attributable to assistance provided by small business development centers, historically Black colleges and universities, minority institutions, and procurement technical assistance centers.
            (2) Three times the total amount of such costs attributable to assistance furnished by the mentor's employees.
            (3) Two times the total amount of other such costs incurred by the mentor in carrying out the developmental assistance program.
            I-110.2 Credit adjustments.
            (a) Adjustments may be made to the amount of credit claimed if the Director, SBP, OUSD(A&S), determines that—
            (1) A mentor firm's performance in the attainment of its subcontracting goals through actual subcontract awards declined from the prior fiscal year without justifiable cause; and
            (2) Imposition of such a limitation on credit appears to be warranted to prevent abuse of this incentive for the mentor firm's participation in the Program.
            (b) The mentor firm must be afforded the opportunity to explain the decline in small business subcontract awards before imposition of any such limitation on credit. In making the final decision to impose a limitation on credit, the Director, SBP, OUSD(A&S), must consider—
            (1) The mentor firm's overall small business participation rates (in terms of percentages of subcontract awards and dollars awarded) as compared to the participation rates existing during the 2 fiscal years prior to the firm's admission to the Program;
            (2) The mentor firm's aggregate prime contract awards during the prior 2 fiscal years and the total amount of subcontract awards under such contracts; and
            (3) Such other information the mentor firm may wish to submit.
            (c) The decision of the Director, SBP, OUSD(A&S), regarding the imposition of a limitation on credit will be final.
            I-111 Agreement terminations.
            (a) Mentors and/or protégés must send a copy of any termination notices to the cognizant Component Director, SBP, that approved the agreement, and the DCMA administrative contracting officer responsible for conducting the annual review pursuant to I-113.
            (b) For reimbursable agreements, mentors must also send copies of any termination to the program manager and to the contracting officer.
            (c) Termination of a mentor-protégé agreement will not impair the obligations of the mentor firm to perform pursuant to its contractual obligations under Government contracts and subcontracts.

            (d) Termination of all or part of the mentor-protégé agreement will not impair the obligations of the protégé firm to perform pursuant to its contractual obligations under any contract awarded to the protégé firm by the mentor firm.
            
            (e) Mentors and protégés will follow provisions of the mentor-protégé agreement developed in compliance with I-107(l) through (n).
            I-112 Reporting requirements.
            I-112.1 Reporting requirements applicable to Individual Subcontract Reports (ISR), Summary Subcontract Reports (SSR) and Standard Forms 294.
            (a) Amounts credited toward applicable subcontracting goal(s) for unreimbursed costs under the Program must be separately identified on the appropriate ISR, SSR or SF 294 reports from the amounts credited toward the goal(s) resulting from the award of actual subcontracts to protégé firms.
