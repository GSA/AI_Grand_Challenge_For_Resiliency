      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <P>I. PROBLEM: Succinctly state the problem created by current FAR and/or DFARS coverage and describe the factual and/or legal reasons necessitating the change to the regulation.</P>
                <P>II. Recommendation: Identify the FAR and/or DFARS citations to be revised. Attach as TAB A a copy of the text of the existing coverage, conformed to include the proposed additions and deletions. Indicate deleted coverage with dashed lines through the current words being deleted and insert proposed language in brackets at the appropriate locations within the existing coverage. If the proposed deleted portion is extensive, it may be outlined by lines forming a box with diagonal lines drawn connecting the corners.</P>
                <P>III. Discussion: Include a complete, convincing explanation of why the change is necessary and how the recommended revision will solve the problem. Address advantages and disadvantages of the proposed revision, as well as any cost or administrative impact on Government activities and contractors. Identify any potential impact of the change on automated systems, e.g., automated financial and procurement systems. Provide any other background information that would be helpful in explaining the issue.</P>
                <P>IV. Collaterals: Address the need for public comment (FAR 1.301(b) and subpart 1.5), the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (FAR 1.301(c)).</P>
                <P>V. Deviations: If a recommended revision of DFARS is a FAR deviation, identify the deviation and include under separate TAB a justification for the deviation that addresses the requirements of 201.402(2).

              <P>(a)(1) DoD implementation and supplementation of the FAR is issued in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) under authorization and subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. The DFARS contains—</P>
              <P>(i) Requirements of law;</P>

              <P>(b) When <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication is required for any policy, procedure, clause, or form, the department or agency requesting Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (USD(AT&amp;L)) approval for use of the policy, procedure, clause, or form (see 201.304(1)) must include an <PRTPAGE P="10"/>analysis of the public comments in the request for approval.

              <P>(a)(i) The DFARS is codified under chapter 2 in title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.</P>
              <P>(ii) To the extent possible, all DFARS text (whether implemental or supplemental) is numbered as if it were implemental. Supplemental numbering is used only when the text cannot be integrated intelligibly with its FAR counterpart.</P>

              <P>(A) Implemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, except when the text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered by skipping a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. For example, three paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 219.501 (1), (2), and (3) rather than (a), (b), and (c). Three paragraphs implementing FAR 19.501(a) would be numbered 219.501(a) (i), (ii), and (iii) rather than (a) (1), (2), and (3). Further subdivision of the paragraphs follows the prescribed numbering sequence, e.g., 219.501(1)(i)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>).</P>
              <P>(B) Supplemental numbering is the same as its FAR counterpart, with the addition of a number of 70 and up or (S-70) and up. Parts, subparts, sections, or subsections are supplemented by the addition of a number of 70 and up. Lower divisions are supplemented by the addition of a number of (S-70) and up. When text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered using the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed sequence, without skipping a unit. For example, DFARS text supplementing FAR 19.501 would be numbered 219.501-70. Its subdivisions would be numbered 219.501-70 (a), (b), and (c).</P>
              <P>(C) Subdivision numbering below the 4th level does not repeat the numbering sequence. It uses italicized Arabic numbers and then italicized lower case Roman numerals.</P>
              <P>(D) An example of DFARS numbering is in Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.</P>
              <P>(iii) Department/agency and component supplements must parallel the FAR and DFARS numbering, except department/agency supplemental numbering uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.</P>

              <P>(1) Not later than 30 days after receiving a DoD Inspector General report in accordance with 203.905, the head of the agency shall determine whether sufficient basis exists to conclude that the contractor has subjected the complainant to a reprisal as prohibited by 203.903 and shall either issue an order denying relief or shall take one or more of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(i) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.</P>
              <P>(ii) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with compensatory damages (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.</P>

              <P>(2) If the head of the agency issues an order denying relief or has not issued an order within 210 days after the submission of the complaint or within 30 days after the expiration of an extension of time granted in accordance with 203.905(3)(ii), and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant—</P>
              <P>(i) The complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with respect to the complaint; and</P>

              <P>(ii) The complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against the contractor to seek compensatory damages and other relief available under 10 U.S.C. 2409 in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury. An action under this authority may not be brought more than two years after the date on which remedies are deemed to have been exhausted.<PRTPAGE P="22"/>

              <P>(3) An Inspector General determination and an agency head order denying relief under paragraph (2) of this section shall be admissible in evidence in any de novo action at law or equity brought pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2409(c).</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever a contractor fails to comply with an order issued by the head of agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2409, the head of the agency or designee shall request the Department of Justice to file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the agency.</P>
              <P>(5) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued by the head of the agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2409 may obtain judicial review of the order's conformance with the law, and the implementing regulation, in the United States Court of Appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency or designee. Review shall conform to Chapter 7 of Title 5, Unites States Code. Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order by the head of an agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.</P>
              <P>(6) The rights and remedies provided for in this subpart may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Elements of a PIID.</E> DoD-issued PIIDs are thirteen characters in length. Use only alpha-numeric characters, as prescribed in FAR 4.1603 and this subpart. Do not use the letter I or O in any part of the PIID.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Position 9.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(A) DoD will use three of the letters reserved for departmental or agency use in FAR 4.1603(a)(3) in this position as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Use M to identify purchase orders and task or delivery orders issued by the enterprise FedMall system.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Use S to identify broad agency announcements.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Use T to identify automated requests for quotations by authorized legacy contract writing systems. See PGI 204.1603(a)(3)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) for the list of authorized systems.</P>
              <P>(B) Do not use other letters identified in FAR 4.1603(a)(3) as “Reserved for future Federal Governmentwide use” or “Reserved for departmental or agency use” in position 9 of the PIID.</P>
              <P>(C) Do not use the letter C or H for contracts or agreements with provisions for orders or calls.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Positions 10 through 17.</E> In accordance with FAR 4.1603(a)(4), DoD-issued PIIDs shall only use positions 10 through 13 to complete the PIID. Enter the serial number of the instrument in these positions. A separate series of serial numbers may be used for any type of instrument listed in FAR 4.1603(a)(3). DoD components assign such series of PIID numbers sequentially. A DoD component may reserve blocks of numbers or alpha-numeric numbers for use by its various activities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Elements of a supplementary PIID.</E> In addition to the supplementary PIID numbering procedures in FAR 4.1603(b), follow the procedures contained in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section. See PGI 204.1603(b) for examples of proper supplementary PIID numbering.</P>
              <P>(2)(ii) <E T="03">Positions 2 through 6.</E> In accordance with FAR 4.1603(b)(2)(ii), DoD-issued supplementary PIIDs shall, for positions 2 through 6 of modifications to contracts and agreements, comply with the following:<PRTPAGE P="30"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Positions 2 and 3.</E> These two digits may be either alpha or numeric characters, except—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Use K, L, M, N, P, and Q only in position 2, and only if the modification is issued by the Air Force and is a provisioned item order;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Use S only in position 2, and only to identify modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions when—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The contract has either FOB origin or destination delivery terms; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The price changes;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Use T, U, V, W, X, or Y only in position 2, and only to identify modifications issued to provide initial or amended shipping instructions when—</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria for establishing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Contracts shall identify the items or services to be acquired as separate contract line items unless it is not feasible to do so.</P>
              <P>(a) Contract line items shall have all four of the following characteristics; however, there are exceptions within the characteristics, which may make establishing a separate contract line item appropriate even though one of the characteristics appears to be missing—</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Single unit price.</E> The item shall have a single unit price or a single total price, except—</P>
              <P>(i) If the item is not separately priced (NSP) but the price is included in the unit price of another contract line item, enter NSP instead of the unit price;</P>
              <P>(ii) When there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items are priced in accordance with 204.7104;</P>
              <P>(iii) When the items or services are being acquired on a cost-reimbursement contract;</P>
              <P>(iv) When the contract is for maintenance and repair services (e.g., a labor hour contract) and firm prices have been established for elements of the total price of an item but the actual number and quantity of the elements are not known until performance. The contracting officer may structure these contracts to reflect a firm or estimated total amount for each line item;</P>
              <P>(v) When the contract line item is established to refer to an exhibit or an attachment (if management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block and enclosed in parentheses); or</P>
              <P>(vi) When the contract is an indefinite delivery type contract and provides that the price of an item shall be determined at the time a delivery order is placed and the price is influenced by such factors as the quantity ordered (e.g., 10-99 @ $1.00, 100-249 @ $.98, 250+ @ $.95), the destination, the FOB point, or the type of packaging required.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Separately identifiable.</E> A contract line item must be identified separately from any other items or services on the contract.</P>
              <P>(i) Supplies are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—</P>
              <P>(A) National stock number (NSN);</P>
              <P>(B) Item description; or<PRTPAGE P="32"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) Manufacturer's part number.</P>
              <P>(ii) Services are separately identifiable if they have no more than one—</P>
              <P>(A) Scope of work; or</P>
              <P>(B) Description of services.</P>
              <P>(iii) This requirement does not apply if there are associated subline items, established for other than informational reasons, and those subline items include the actual detailed identification in accordance with 204.7104. Where this exception applies, use a general narrative description instead of the contract item description.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Separate delivery schedule.</E> Each contract line item or service shall have its own delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date expressly stated (“as required” constitutes an expressly stated delivery term).</P>
              <P>(i) The fact that there is more than one delivery date, destination, performance date, or performance point may be a determining factor in the decision as to whether to establish more than one contract line item.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a contract line item has more than one destination or delivery date, the contracting officer may create individual contract line items for the different destinations or delivery dates, or may specify the different delivery dates for the units by destination in the delivery schedule.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Single accounting classification citation.</E> (i) Each contract line item shall reference a single accounting classification citation except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this subsection.</P>
              <P>(ii) The use of multiple accounting classification citations for a contract line item is authorized in the following situations:</P>
              <P>(A) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with R&amp;D or other funds properly incrementally obligated over several fiscal years in accordance with DoD policy;</P>
              <P>(B) A single, nonseverable deliverable to be paid for with different authorizations or appropriations, such as in the acquisition of a satellite or the modification of production tooling used to produce items being acquired by several activities; or</P>
              <P>(C) A modification to an existing contract line item for a nonseverable deliverable that results in the delivery of a modified item(s) where the item(s) and modification are to be paid for with different accounting classification citations.</P>
              <P>(iii) When the use of multiple accounting classification citations is authorized for a single contract line item, establish informational subline items for each accounting classification citation in accordance with 204.7104-1(a).</P>
              <P>(b) All subline items and exhibit line items under one contract line item shall be the same contract type as the contract line item.</P>
              <P>(c) For a contract that contains a combination of fixed-price line items, time-and-materials/labor-hour line items, and/or cost-reimbursement line items, identify the contract type for each contract line item in Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs, to facilitate appropriate payment.</P>
              <P>(d) Exhibits may be used as an alternative to putting a long list of contract line items in the schedule. If exhibits are used, create a contract line item citing the exhibit's identifier. See 204.7105.</P>
              <P>(e) If the contract involves a test model or a first article which must be approved, establish a separate contract line item or subline item for each item of supply or service which must be approved. If the test model or first article consists of a lot composed of a mixture of items, a single line item or subline item may be used for the lot.</P>
              <P>(f) If a supply or service involves ancillary functions, like packaging and handling, transportation, payment of state or local taxes, or use of reusable containers, and these functions are normally performed by the contractor and the contractor is normally entitled to reimbursement for performing these functions, do not establish a separate contract line item solely to account for these functions. However, do identify the functions in the contract schedule. If the offeror separately prices these functions, contracting officers may establish separate contract line items for the functions; however, the separate line items must conform to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection.</P>

              <P>(g) Certain commercial items and initial provisioning spares for weapons <PRTPAGE P="33"/>systems are requested and subsequently solicited using units of measure such as kit, set, or lot. However, there are times when individual items within that kit, set, or lot are not grouped and delivered in a single shipment. This creates potential contract administration issues with inspection, acceptance, and payment. In such cases, solicitations should be structured to allow offerors to provide information about products that may not have been known to the Government prior to solicitation and propose an alternate line item structure as long as the alternate is consistent with the requirements of 204.71, which provides explicit guidance on the use of contract line items and subline items, and with PGI 204.71.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria for establishing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Contract subline items provide flexibility to further identify elements within a contract line item for tracking performance or simplifying administration. There are only two kinds of subline items: those which are informational in nature and those which consist of more than one item that requires separate identification.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Informational subline items.</E> (1) This type of subline item identifies information that relates directly to the contract line item and is an integral part of it (e.g., parts of an assembly or parts of a kit). These subline items shall not be scheduled separately for delivery, identified separately for shipment or performance, or priced separately for payment purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) The informational subline item may include quantities, prices, or amounts, if necessary to satisfy management requirements. However, these elements shall be included within the item description in the supplies/services column and enclosed in parentheses to prevent confusing them with quantities, prices, or amounts that have contractual significance. Do not enter these elements in the quantity and price columns.</P>
              <P>(3) Informational subline items shall be used to identify each accounting classification citation assigned to a single contract line item number when use of multiple citations is authorized (see 204.7103-1(a)(4)(ii)).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Separately identified subline items.</E> (1) Subline items will be used instead of contract line items to facilitate payment, delivery tracking, contract funds accounting, or other management purposes. Such subline items shall be used when items bought under one contract line item number—</P>
              <P>(i) Are to be paid for from more than one accounting classification. A subline item shall be established for the quantity associated with the single accounting classification citation. Establish a line item rather than a subline item if it is likely that a subline item may be assigned additional accounting classification citations at a later date. Identify the funding as described in 204.7104-1(a)(3);</P>
              <P>(ii) Are to be packaged in different sizes, each represented by its own NSN;</P>
              <P>(iii) Have collateral costs, such as packaging costs, but those costs are not a part of the unit price of the contract line item;</P>
              <P>(iv) Have different delivery dates or destinations or requisitions, or a combination of the three; or</P>
              <P>(v) Identify parts of an assembly or kit which—</P>
              <P>(A) Have to be separately identified at the time of shipment or performance; and</P>
              <P>(B) Are separately priced.</P>
              <P>(2) Each separately identified contract subline item shall have its own—</P>
              <P>(i) Delivery schedule, period of performance, or completion date;</P>
              <P>(ii) Unit price or single total price or amount (not separately priced (NSP) is acceptable as an entry for price or amount if the price is included in another subline item or a different contract line item). This requirement does not apply—</P>

              <P>(A) If the subline item was created to refer to an exhibit or an attachment. If <PRTPAGE P="34"/>management needs dictate that a unit price be entered, the price shall be set forth in the item description block of the schedule and enclosed in parentheses; or</P>
              <P>(B) In the case of indefinite delivery contracts described at 204.7103-1(a)(1)(vi).</P>
              <P>(iii) Identification (e.g., NSN, item description, manufacturer's part number, scope of work, description of services).</P>
              <P>(3) Unit prices and extended amounts.</P>
              <P>(i) The unit price and total amount for all subline items may be entered at the contract line item number level if the unit price for the subline items is identical. If there is any variation, the subline item unit prices shall be entered at the subline item level only.</P>
              <P>(ii) The unit price and extended amounts may be entered at the subline items level.</P>
              <P>(iii) The two methods in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this subsection shall not be combined in a contract line item.</P>

              <P>(C) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item and the change does not involve either the delivery date or the ship-to/mark-for data, the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number shall remain with the unchanged quantity.

If the unit prices of the two quantities <PRTPAGE P="35"/>will be different, assign the new quantity the next available number.</P>
              <P>(C) If the modification both affects only a partial quantity of the existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item and definitizes the price for the affected portion, the definitized portion shall retain the original item number. If there is any undefinitized portion of the item, assign it the next available number. However, if the modification definitizes the price for the whole quantity of the line item, and price impact of the changed work can be apportioned equally over the whole to arrive at a new unit price, the quantity with the changes can be added into the quantity of the existing item.</P>
              <P>(D) If the modification affects only a partial quantity of an existing contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item but does not change the delivery schedule or definitize price, the unchanged portion shall retain the original contract line item or subline item or exhibit line item number. Assign the changed portion the next available number.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Additional requirements for major systems.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(b)(1)(A) The contracting officer is prohibited by 10 U.S.C. 2305(d)(4)(A) from requiring offers for development or production of major systems that would enable the Government to use technical data to competitively reprocure identical items or components of the system if the item or component were developed exclusively at private expense, unless the contracting officer determines that—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The original supplier of the item or component will be unable to satisfy program schedule or delivery requirements;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Proposals by the original supplier of the item or component to meet mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency's mobilization needs; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The Government is otherwise entitled to unlimited rights in technical data.</P>

              <P>(B) If the contracting officer makes a determination, under paragraphs (b)(1)(A) (<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, for a competitive solicitation, 10 U.S.C. 2305(d)(4)(B) requires that the evaluation of items developed at private expense be based on an analysis of the total value, in terms of innovative design, life-cycle costs, and other pertinent factors, of incorporating such items in the system.</P>
              <P>(S-70)(1) In accordance with Section 802(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Pub. L. 109-364) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for major weapon systems and subsystems of major weapon systems shall—</P>
              <P>(i) Assess the long-term technical data and computer software needs of those systems and subsystems; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Establish acquisition strategies that provide for the technical data and computer software deliverables and associated license rights needed to sustain those systems and subsystems <PRTPAGE P="47"/>over their life cycle. The strategy may include—</P>
              <P>(A) The development of maintenance capabilities within DoD; or</P>
              <P>(B) Competition for contracts for sustainment of the systems or subsystems.</P>
              <P>(2) Assessments and corresponding acquisition strategies developed under this section shall—</P>
              <P>(i) Be developed before issuance of a solicitation for the weapon system or subsystem;</P>
              <P>(ii) Address the merits of including a priced contract option for the future delivery of technical data and computer software, and associated license rights, that were not acquired upon initial contract award;</P>
              <P>(iii) Address the potential for changes in the sustainment plan over the life cycle of the weapon system or subsystem; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Apply to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported by performance-based logistics arrangements as well as to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported by other sustainment approaches.</P>
              <P>(S-71) See 209.570 for policy applicable to acquisition strategies that consider the use of lead system integrators.</P>
              <P>(S-72)(1) In accordance with section 202 of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-23), acquisition plans for major defense acquisition programs as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2430, shall include measures that—</P>
              <P>(i) Ensure competition, or the option of competition, at both the prime contract level and subcontract level (at such tier or tiers as are appropriate) throughout the program life cycle as a means to improve contractor performance; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Document the rationale for the selection of the appropriate subcontract tier or tiers under paragraph (S-72)(1)(i) of this section, and the measures which will be employed to ensure competition, or the option of competition.</P>
              <P>(2) Measures to ensure competition, or the option of competition, may include, but are not limited to, cost-effective measures intended to achieve the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Competitive prototyping.</P>
              <P>(ii) Dual-sourcing.</P>
              <P>(iii) Unbundling of contracts.</P>
              <P>(iv) Funding of next-generation prototype systems or subsystems.</P>
              <P>(v) Use of modular, open architectures to enable competition for upgrades.</P>
              <P>(vi) Use of build-to-print approaches to enable production through multiple sources.</P>
              <P>(vii) Acquisition of complete technical data packages.</P>
              <P>(viii) Periodic competitions for subsystem upgrades.</P>
              <P>(ix) Licensing of additional suppliers.</P>
              <P>(x) Periodic system or program reviews to address long-term competitive effects of program decisions.</P>
              <P>(3) In order to ensure fair and objective “make-or-buy” decisions by prime contractors, acquisition strategies and resultant solicitations and contracts shall—</P>
              <P>(i) Require prime contractors to give full and fair consideration to qualified sources other than the prime contractor for the development or construction of major subsystems and components of major weapon systems;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide for Government surveillance of the process by which prime contractors consider such sources and determine whether to conduct such development or construction in-house or through a subcontract; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide for the assessment of the extent to which the prime contractor has given full and fair consideration to qualified sources in sourcing decisions as a part of past performance evaluations.</P>
              <P>(4) Whenever a source-of-repair decision results in a plan to award a contract for the performance of maintenance and sustainment services on a major weapon system, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with statutory requirements, the acquisition plan shall prescribe that award will be made on a competitive basis after giving full consideration to all sources (including sources that partner or subcontract with public or private sector repair activities).</P>

              <P>(S-73) In accordance with section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-<PRTPAGE P="48"/>417) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for major weapons systems shall include a plan for the preservation and storage of special tooling associated with the production of hardware for major defense acquisition programs through the end of the service life of the related weapons system. The plan shall include the identification of any contract clauses, facilities, and funding required for the preservation and storage of such tooling. The Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD (AT&amp;L)) may waive this requirement if USD (AT&amp;L) determines that it is in the best interest of DoD.</P>
              <P>(S-74) When selecting contract type, see 234.004 (section 811 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)).</P>

              <P>DoD policy is to break out components of weapons systems or other major end items under certain circumstances.</P>
              <P>(a) When it is anticipated that a prime contract will be awarded without adequate price competition, and the prime contractor is expected to acquire any component without adequate price competition, the agency shall break out that component if—</P>
              <P>(1) Substantial net cost savings probably will be achieved; and</P>
              <P>(2) Breakout action will not jeopardize the quality, reliability, performance, or timely delivery of the end item.</P>
              <P>(b) Even when either or both the prime contract and the component will be acquired with adequate price competition, the agency shall consider breakout of the component if substantial net cost savings will result from—</P>
              <P>(1) Greater quantity acquisitions; or</P>
              <P>(2) Such factors as improved logistics support (through reduction in varieties of spare parts) and economies in operations and training (through standardization of design).</P>
              <P>(c) Breakout normally is not justified for a component that is not expected to exceed $1 million for the current year's requirement.</P>

              <P>(b)(i) The Procurement Cause and Treatment Code “H” annotation in the Exclusions section of the System for Award Management (SAM Exclusions) identifies contractor facilities where no part of a contract or subcontract may be performed because of a violation of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7606) or the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368).</P>
              <P>(ii) Under the authority of Section 8 of Executive Order 11738, the agency head may grant an exemption permitting award to a contractor using a Code “H” ineligible facility if the agency head determines that such an exemption is in the paramount interest of the United States.</P>
              <P>(A) The agency head may delegate this exemption authority to a level no lower than a general or flag officer or a member of the Senior Executive Service.</P>
              <P>(B) The official granting the exemption—</P>

              <P>(b) Contracting officers generally should seek to resolve organizational conflicts of interest in a manner that will promote competition and preserve DoD access to the expertise and experience of qualified contractors. Accordingly, contracting officers should, to the extent feasible, employ organizational conflict of interest resolution strategies that do not unnecessarily restrict the pool of potential offerors in current or future acquisitions. Further, contracting activities shall not impose across-the-board restrictions or limitations on the use of particular resolution methods, except as may be required under 209.571-7 or as may be appropriate in particular acquisitions.</P>

              <P>(b) If the contracting officer and the contractor have agreed to mitigation of an organizational conflict of interest, a Government-approved Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan, reflecting the actions a contractor has agreed to take to mitigate a conflict, shall be incorporated into the contract.</P>

              <P>(c) If the contracting officer determines, after consultation with agency legal counsel, that the otherwise successful offeror is unable to effectively mitigate an organizational conflict of interest, then the contracting officer, taking into account both the instant contract and longer term Government needs, shall use another approach to resolve the organizational conflict of interest, select another offeror, or request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 (but <E T="03">see</E> statutory prohibition in 209.571-7, which cannot be waived).</P>
              <P>(d) For any acquisition that exceeds $1 billion, the contracting officer shall brief the senior procurement executive before determining that an offeror's mitigation plan is unacceptable.</P>

              <P>(A) The contracting officer may presume that a prior commercial item determination made by a military department, a defense agency, or another component of DoD shall serve as a determination for subsequent procurements of such item. See PGI 212.102(a)(ii) for information about items that the Department has historically acquired as military unique, noncommercial items.</P>
              <P>(B) If the contracting officer does not make the presumption that a prior commercial item determination is valid, and instead chooses to proceed with a procurement of an item previously determined to be a commercial item using procedures other than the procedures authorized for the procurement of a commercial item, the contracting officer shall request a review of the commercial item determination by the head of the contracting activity that will conduct the procurement.

This permissive authority is intended to enhance defense innovation and investment, enable DoD to acquire items that otherwise might not have been available, and create incentives for nontraditional defense contractors <PRTPAGE P="76"/>to do business with DoD. It is not intended to recategorize current noncommercial items, however, when appropriate, contracting officers may consider applying commercial item procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from business segments that meet the definition of “nontraditional defense contractor” even though they have been established under traditional defense contractors. The decision to apply commercial item procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from nontraditional defense contractors does not require a commercial item determination and does not mean the item is commercial.</P>

              <P>(b) If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, is insufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison. In assessing whether the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison, the contracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased (10 U.S.C. 2306a(b)).</P>

L. 112-81), when acquiring tents or other temporary structures for use by the Armed Forces, the contracting officer shall award contracts that provide the best value. Temporary structures covered by this paragraph are nonpermanent buildings, including tactical shelters, nonpermanent modular or pre-fabricated buildings, or portable or relocatable buildings, such as trailers or equipment configured for occupancy (see also 246.270-2). Determination of best value includes consideration of the total life-cycle costs of such tents or structures, including the costs associated with any equipment, fuel, or electricity needed to heat, cool, or light such tents or structures (see FAR 7.105(a)(3)(i) and PGI 207.105(a)(3)(i)).</P>
            <P>(b) The requirements of this section apply to any agency or department that acquires tents or other temporary structures on behalf of DoD (see FAR 17.503(d)(2)).</P>

            <P>(1) In accordance with section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub.

L. 115-91) (see 10 U.S.C. 2305 note), the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process shall only be used when—</P>
            <P>(i) Minimum requirements can be described clearly and comprehensively and expressed in terms of performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to determine the acceptability of offers;</P>
            <P>(ii) No, or minimal, value will be realized from a proposal that exceeds the minimum technical or performance requirements;</P>
            <P>(iii) The proposed technical approaches will require no, or minimal, subjective judgment by the source selection authority as to the desirability of one offeror's proposal versus a competing proposal;</P>
            <P>(iv) The source selection authority has a high degree of confidence that reviewing the technical proposals of all offerors would not result in the identification of characteristics that could provide value or benefit;</P>
            <P>(v) No, or minimal, additional innovation or future technological advantage will be realized by using a different source selection process;</P>

            <P>(vi) Goods to be procured are predominantly expendable in nature, are nontechnical, or have a short life expectancy or short shelf life (See PGI 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vi) for assistance with evaluating whether a requirement satisfies this limitation);<PRTPAGE P="95"/>
            </P>
            <P>(vii) The contract file contains a determination that the lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs (as defined at FAR 7.101) of the product(s) or service(s) being acquired (see PGI 215.101-2-70(a)(1)(vii) for information on obtaining this determination); and</P>
            <P>(viii) The contracting officer documents the contract file describing the circumstances justifying the use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.</P>
            <P>(2) In accordance with section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, as amended by section 822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Pub. L. 115-91) (see 10 U.S.C. 2305 note), contracting officers shall avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process in the case of a procurement that is predominately for the acquisition of—</P>
            <P>(i) Information technology services, cybersecurity services, systems engineering and technical assistance services, advanced electronic testing, or other knowledge-based professional services;</P>
            <P>(ii) Items designated by the requiring activity as personal protective equipment (except see paragraph (b)(1) of this section); or</P>
            <P>(iii) Services designated by the requiring activity as knowledge-based training or logistics services in contingency operations or other operations outside the United States, including in Afghanistan or Iraq.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(1) In accordance with section 814 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 as amended by section 882 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (see 10 U.S.C. 2302 note), contracting officers shall not use the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to procure items designated by the requiring activity as personal protective equipment or an aviation critical safety item, when the requiring activity advises the contracting officer that the level of quality or failure of the equipment or item could result in combat casualties. See 252.209-7010 for the definition and identification of critical safety items.</P>
            <P>(2) In accordance with section 832 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (see 10 U.S.C. 2442 note), contracting officers shall not use the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to acquire engineering and manufacturing development for a major defense acquisition program for which budgetary authority is requested beginning in fiscal year 2019.</P>
            <P>(3) Contracting officers shall make award decisions based on best value factors and criteria, as determined by the resource sponsor (in accordance with agency procedures), for an auditing contract. The use of the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is prohibited (10 U.S.C. 254b).</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Price analysis for commercial and noncommercial items.</E> (i) In the absence of adequate price competition in response to the solicitation, pricing based on market prices is the preferred method to establish a fair and reasonable price (see PGI 215.404-1(b)(i)).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through market research is insufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall consider information submitted by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items under comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison. The contracting officer shall consider the totality of other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased (section 853 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Pub. L. 114-92)).</P>
              <P>(iii) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide sufficient information as described in paragraph (b)(ii) of this section to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to submit information on—</P>
              <P>(A) Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and conditions;</P>
              <P>(B) Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or services;</P>
              <P>(C) Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and</P>
              <P>(D) Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining the reasonableness of price.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submitted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information, to include cost data. However, no cost data may be required in any case in which there are sufficient non-Government sales of the same item to establish reasonableness of price (section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239)).</P>
              <P>(v) When evaluating pricing data, the contracting officer shall consider materially differing terms and conditions, quantities, and market and economic factors. For similar items, the contracting officer shall also consider material differences between the similar item and the item being procured (see FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)(B) and PGI 215.404-1(b)(v)). Material differences are those that could reasonably be expected to influence the contracting officer's determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer shall consider the following factors when evaluating the relevance of the information available:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Market prices.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Age of data.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Whether data is too old to be relevant depends on the industry (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> rapidly evolving technologies), product maturity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> stable), economic factors (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> new sellers in the marketplace), and various other considerations.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A pending sale may be relevant if, in the judgement of the contracting officer, it is probable at the anticipated price, and the sale could reasonably be <PRTPAGE P="104"/>expected to materially influence the contracting officer's determination of price reasonableness. The contracting officer may consult with the cognizant administrative contracting officers (ACOs) as they may have information about pending sales.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Volume and completeness of transaction data.</E> Data must include a sufficient number of transactions to represent the range of relevant sales to all types of customers. The data must also include key information, such as date, quantity sold, part number, part nomenclature, sales price, and customer. If the number of transactions is insufficient or the data is incomplete, the contracting officer shall request additional sales data to evaluate price reasonableness. If the contractor cannot provide sufficient sales data, the contracting officer shall request other relevant information.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Nature of transactions.</E> The nature of a sales transaction includes the information necessary to understand the transaction, such as terms and conditions, date, quantity sold, sale price, unique requirements, the type of customer (government, distributor, retail end-user, etc.), and related agreements. It also includes warranties, key product technical specifications, maintenance agreements, and preferred customer rewards.</P>
              <P>(vi) The contracting officer shall consider catalog prices to be reliable when they are regularly maintained and supported by relevant sales data (including any related discounts, refunds, rebates, offsets, or other adjustments). The contracting officer may request that the offeror support differences between the proposed price(s), catalog price(s), and relevant sales data.</P>
              <P>(vii) The contracting officer may consult with the DoD cadre of experts who are available to provide expert advice to the acquisition workforce in assisting with commercial item and price reasonableness determinations. The DoD cadre of experts is identified at PGI 215.404-1(b)(vii).</P>

              <P>(b) The contracting officer assigns values to each profit factor; the value multiplied by the base results in the profit objective for that factor. Except for the cost efficiency special factor, each profit factor has a normal value and a designated range of values. The normal value is representative of average conditions on the prospective contract when compared to all goods and services acquired by DoD. The designated range provides values based on above normal or below normal conditions. In the price negotiation documentation, the contracting officer need not explain assignment of the normal value, but should address conditions that justify assignment of other than the normal value. The cost efficiency special factor has no normal value. The contracting officer shall exercise sound business judgment in selecting a value when this special factor is used (see 215.404-71-5).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contract type risk and working capital adjustment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> The contract type risk factor focuses on the degree of cost risk accepted by the contractor under varying contract types. The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit objective for contract type risk. It only applies to fixed-price contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula approach, it is not intended to be an exact calculation of the cost of working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the contractor's cost of working capital under varying contract circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination.</E> The following extract from the DD 1547 is annotated to explain the process.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Facilities capital employed.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> This factor focuses on encouraging and rewarding capital investment in facilities that benefit DoD. It recognizes both the facilities capital that the contractor will employ in contract performance and the contractor's commitment to improving productivity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contract facilities capital estimates.</E> The contracting officer shall estimate the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed using—</P>
              <P>(1) An analysis of the appropriate Forms CASB-CMF and cost of money factors (48 CFR 9904.414 and FAR 31.205-10); and</P>
              <P>(2) DD Form 1861, Contract Facilities Capital Cost of Money.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of DD Form 1861.</E> See PGI 215.404-71-4(c) for obtaining field pricing support for preparing DD Form 1861.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The DD Form 1861 provides a means of linking the Form CASB-CMF and DD Form 1547, Record of Weighted Guidelines Application. It—</P>
              <P>(i) Enables the contracting officer to differentiate profit objectives for various types of assets (land, buildings, equipment). The procedure is similar to applying overhead rates to appropriate overhead allocation bases to determine contract overhead costs.</P>
              <P>(ii) Is designed to record and compute the contract facilities capital cost of money and capital employed which is carried forward to DD Form 1547.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Completion instructions.</E> Complete a DD Form 1861 only after evaluating the contractor's cost proposal, establishing cost of money factors, and establishing a prenegotiation objective on cost. Complete the form as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) List overhead pools and direct-charging service centers (if used) in the same structure as they appear on the contractor's cost proposal and Form CASB-CMF. The structure and allocation base units-of-measure must be compatible on all three displays.</P>
              <P>(ii) Extract appropriate contract overhead allocation base data, by year, from the evaluated cost breakdown or prenegotiation cost objective and list against each overhead pool and direct-charging service center.</P>
              <P>(iii) Multiply each allocation base by its corresponding cost of money factor to get the facilities capital cost of money estimated to be incurred each year. The sum of these products represents the estimated contract facilities capital cost of money for the year's effort.</P>

              <P>(iv) Total contract facilities cost of money is the sum of the yearly amounts.<PRTPAGE P="112"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) Since the facilities capital cost of money factors reflect the applicable cost of money rate in Column 1 of Form CASB-CMF, divide the contract cost of money by that same rate to determine the contract facilities capital employed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Preaward facilities capital applications.</E> To establish cost and price objectives, apply the facilities capital cost of money and capital employed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Cost of Money.</E> (i) <E T="03">Cost Objective.</E> Use the imputed facilities capital cost of money, with normal, booked costs, to establish a cost objective or the target cost when structuring an incentive type contract. Do not adjust target costs established at the outset even though actual cost of money rates become available during the period of contract performance.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Profit Objective.</E> When measuring the contractor's effort for the purpose of establishing a prenegotiation profit objective, restrict the cost base to normal, booked costs. Do not include cost of money as part of the cost base.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Facilities Capital Employed.</E> Assess and weight the profit objective for risk associated with facilities capital employed in accordance with the profit guidelines at 215.404-71-4.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination.</E> The following extract from the DD Form 1547 has been annotated to explain the process.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cost efficiency factor.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This special factor provides an incentive for contractors to reduce costs. To the extent that the contractor can demonstrate cost reduction efforts that benefit the pending contract, the contracting officer may increase the prenegotiation profit objective by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of total objective cost (Block 20 of the DD Form 1547) to recognize these efforts (Block 29).</P>
              <P>(b) To determine if using this factor is appropriate, the contracting officer shall consider criteria, such as the following, to evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract:</P>
              <P>(1) The contractor's participation in Single Process Initiative improvements;</P>
              <P>(2) Actual cost reductions achieved on prior contracts;</P>
              <P>(3) Reduction or elimination of excess or idle facilities;</P>
              <P>(4) The contractor's cost reduction initiatives (e.g., competition advocacy programs, technical insertion programs, obsolete parts control programs, spare parts pricing reform, value engineering, outsourcing of functions such as information technology). Metrics developed by the contractor such as fully loaded labor hours (i.e., cost per labor hour, including all direct and indirect costs) or other productivity measures may provide the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the contractor's cost reduction initiatives over time;</P>
              <P>(5) The contractor's adoption of process improvements to reduce costs;</P>
              <P>(6) Subcontractor cost reduction efforts;</P>
              <P>(7) The contractor's effective incorporation of commercial items and processes; or</P>
              <P>(8) The contractor's investment in new facilities when such investments contribute to better asset utilization or improved productivity.</P>
              <P>(c) When selecting the percentage to use for this special factor, the contracting officer has maximum flexibility in determining the best way to evaluate the benefit the contractor's cost reduction efforts will have on the pending contract. However, the contracting officer shall consider the impact that quantity differences, learning, changes in scope, and economic factors such as inflation and deflation will have on cost reduction.</P>

              <P>(a) The contracting officer may use an alternate structured approach under 215.404-4(c).</P>
              <P>(b) The contracting officer may design the structure of the alternate, but it shall include—</P>
              <P>(1) Consideration of the three basic components of profit—performance risk, contract type risk (including working capital), and facilities capital employed. However, the contracting officer is not required to complete Blocks 21 through 30 of the DD Form 1547.</P>
              <P>(2) Offset for facilities capital cost of money.</P>
              <P>(i) The contracting officer shall reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective by the amount of facilities capital cost of money under Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 414, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital (48 CFR 9904.414). Cost of money under CAS 417, Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction (48 CFR 9904.417), should not be used to reduce the overall prenegotiation profit objective. The profit amount in the negotiation summary of the DD Form 1547 must be net of the offset.</P>
              <P>(ii) This adjustment is needed for the following reason: The values of the profit factors used in the weighted guidelines method were adjusted to recognize the shift in facilities capital cost of money from an element of profit to an element of contract cost (see FAR 31.205-10) and reductions were made directly to the profit factors for performance risk. In order to ensure that this policy is applied to all DoD contracts that allow facilities capital cost of money, similar adjustments shall be made to contracts that use alternate structured approaches.</P>

              <P>(A) Completeness of the contractor's voluntary disclosure on the affected contract.</P>
              <P>(B) Accuracy of the contractor's cost impact calculation for the affected contract.</P>

              <P>(ii) Voluntary disclosure of defective pricing is not a voluntary refund as defined in 242.7100 and does not waive the Government entitlement to the recovery of any overpayment plus interest on the overpayments in accordance with FAR 15.407-1(b)(7).</P>
              <P>(iii) Voluntary disclosure of defective pricing does not waive the Government's rights to pursue defective pricing claims on the affected contract or any other Government contract.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Multiyear contracts for services.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for a period of not more than 5 years for the following types of services (and items of supply relating to such services), even though funds are limited by statute to obligation only during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)) . Covered services are—</P>
              <P>(1) Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;</P>
              <P>(2) Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly complex military equipment;</P>

              <P>(3) Specialized training requiring high-quality instructor skills (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> training for pilots and aircrew members or foreign language training);</P>
              <P>(4) Base services (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ground maintenance, in-plane refueling, bus transportation, and refuse collection and disposal); and</P>
              <P>(5) Environmental remediation services for—</P>
              <P>(i) An active military installation;</P>
              <P>(ii) A military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or</P>
              <P>(iii) A site formerly used by DoD (10 U.S.C. 2306c(b)).</P>
              <P>(b) The head of the agency must be guided by the following principles when entering into a multiyear contract for services:</P>

              <P>(1) The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of the plant or equipment. As used in this section, “useful commercial life” means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life, with due consideration given to such factors as the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.<PRTPAGE P="130"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Consider the desirability of obtaining an option to extend the term of the contract for a reasonable period not to exceed 3 years at prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other nonrecurring costs already amortized.</P>
              <P>(3) Consider the desirability of reserving the right to take title, under the appropriate circumstances, to the plant or equipment upon payment of the unamortized portion of the cost (10 U.S.C. 2306c(c)).</P>
              <P>(c) Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head of the agency must make a written determination that—</P>
              <P>(1) There will be a continuing requirement for the services consistent with current plans for the proposed contract period;</P>
              <P>(2) Furnishing the services will require—</P>
              <P>(i) A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The incurrence of substantial contingent liabilities for the assembly, training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and</P>
              <P>(3) Using a multiyear contract will promote the best interests of the United States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operations (10 U.S.C. 2306c(a)).</P>
              <P>(d) The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for services if the value of the multiyear contract exceeds $678.5 million unless a law specifically provides authority for the contract (10 U.S.C. 2306c(d)(2))().</P>

              <P>(f)(1) The head of the agency must not enter into or extend a multiyear contract that exceeds $678.5 million (when entered into or extended) until the Secretary of Defense identifies the contract and any extension in a report submitted to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 2306b(l)(5)).</P>

              <P>(2) In addition, for contracts equal to or greater than $678.5 million, the head of the contracting activity must determine that the conditions required by <PRTPAGE P="131"/>paragraph (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section will be met by such contract, in accordance with the Secretary's certification and determination required by paragraph (h)(2) of this section .</P>

Before initiating an advance procurement, the contracting officer must verify that it is consistent with DoD policy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the full funding policy in Volume 2A, chapter 1, of DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation).</P>
              <P>(h) The head of the agency shall ensure that the following conditions are satisfied before awarding a multiyear contract for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority:</P>
              <P>(1) The multiyear exhibits required by DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, are included in the agency's budget estimate submission and the President's budget request.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress in writing, by no later than 30 days before entry into such contracts, that each of the conditions in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section is satisfied (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3).</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary has determined that each of the requirements in FAR 17.105-1, paragraphs (b)(1) through (5), will be met by such contract and has provided the basis for such determination to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(A)).</P>
              <P>(ii) The Secretary's determination under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section was made after the completion of a cost analysis performed by the Defense Cost and Resource Center of the Department of Defense and such analysis supports the findings (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(B)).</P>
              <P>(iii) The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 10 USC 2433(d) within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such contract) will be awarded (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(C)).</P>
              <P>(iv) A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(D)).</P>
              <P>(v) Sufficient funds will be available in the fiscal year in which the contract is to be awarded to perform the contract, and the future-years defense program for such fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without cancellation (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(E)).</P>
              <P>(vi) The contract is a fixed price type contract (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(F)).</P>
              <P>(vii) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates, given the existing tooling and facilities (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(G)). The head of the agency shall submit to OUSD(C)(P/B) information supporting the agency's determination that this requirement has been met .</P>
              <P>(viii) The head of the agency shall submit information supporting this certification to OUSD(C)(P/B)&amp; for transmission to Congress through the Secretary of Defense.</P>
              <P>(A) The head of the agency shall, as part of this certification, give written notification to the congressional defense committees of—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and</P>

              <P>(3) The contract is for the procurement of a complete and usable end item (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(5)(A)).</P>
              <P>(4) Funds appropriated for any fiscal year for advance procurement are obligated only for the procurement of those long-lead items that are necessary in order to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete major end items that are programmed under the contract to be acquired with funds appropriated for a subsequent fiscal year (including an economic order quantity of such long-lead items when authorized by law (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(5)(B)).</P>
              <P>(5) The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such certification are not met if the Secretary determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the Secretary provides the basis for such determination with the certification (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(6)).</P>
              <P>(6) The Secretary of Defense may not delegate this authority to make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section or the determination under paragraph (h)(5) of this section to an official below the level of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(7)).</P>
              <P>(7) All other requirements of law are met and there are no other statutory restrictions on using a multiyear contract for the specific system or component . One such restriction may be the achievement of specified cost savings. If the agency finds, after negotiations with the contractor(s), that the specified savings cannot be achieved, the head of the agency shall assess the savings that, nevertheless, could be achieved by using a multiyear contract. If the savings are substantial, the head of the agency may request relief from the law's specific savings requirement (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(4)). The request shall—</P>
              <P>(i) Quantify the savings that can be achieved;</P>
              <P>(ii) Explain any other benefits to the Government of using the multiyear contract;</P>
              <P>(iii) Include details regarding the negotiated contract terms and conditions; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Be submitted to OUSD(AT&amp;L)DPAP for transmission to Congress via the Secretary of Defense and the President.</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary of Defense may instruct the head of the agency proposing a multiyear contract to include in that contract negotiated priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured over the life of the contract (10 U.S.C. 2306b(j)).</P>
              <P>(j) Any requests for increased funding or reprogramming for procurement of a major system under a multiyear contract shall be accompanied by an explanation of how the request for increased funding affects the determinations made by the Secretary of Defense under 217.172(h)(2) (10 U.S.C. 2306b(m)).</P>

              <P>Contractors shall identify their sources of supply in contracts for supplies. Contractor identification of sources of supply enables solicitation, in subsequent acquisitions, of actual manufacturers or other suppliers of items. This enhances competition and potentially avoids payment of additional costs for no significant added value.</P>

              <P>(a) Whenever practicable, include a requirement for contractor identification of sources of supply in all contracts for the delivery of supplies. The identification shall include—</P>
              <P>(1) The item's actual manufacturer or producer, or all the contractor's sources for the item;</P>

              <P>(1) Using FAR 6.302-5;</P>
              <P>(2) The contracting officer already has the information required by the provision (e.g., the information was obtained under other acquisitions);</P>
              <P>(3) The contract is for subsistence, clothing or textiles, fuels, or supplies purchased and used outside the United States;</P>
              <P>(4) The contracting officer determines that it would not be practicable to require offerors/contractors to provide the information, e.g., nonrepetitive local purchases; or</P>
              <P>(5) The contracting officer determines that the exception at 217.7302(b) applies to all items under the solicitation.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Test Program.</E> In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 637 note, DoD has established a test program to determine whether comprehensive subcontracting plans on a corporate, division, or plant-wide basis will reduce administrative burdens while enhancing subcontracting opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. This program is referred to as the Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans (Test Program).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility requirements.</E> To become and remain eligible to participate in the Test Program, a business concern is required to have furnished supplies or services (including construction) under at least three DoD contracts during the preceding fiscal year, having an aggregate value of at least $100 million.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Comprehensive subcontracting plans.</E> (1) The Defense Contract Management Agency will designate the contracting officer who shall negotiate and approve comprehensive subcontracting plans with eligible participants on an annual basis.</P>
              <P>(2) Test Program participants use their comprehensive subcontracting plans, in lieu of individual subcontracting plans, when performing any DoD contract or subcontract that requires a subcontracting plan.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Assessment.</E> The contracting officer designated to manage the comprehensive subcontracting plan shall conduct a compliance review during the fiscal year after the close of the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable. The contracting officer shall compare the approved percentage or dollar goals to the total, actual subcontracting dollars covered by the comprehensive subcontracting plan.</P>
              <P>(1) If the contractor has failed to meet its approved subcontracting goal(s), the contracting officer shall give the contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising of the potential for assessment of liquidated damages, permitting the contractor to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer period at the contracting officer's discretion) within which to respond. The contracting officer may take the contractor's failure to respond to the notice as an admission that no valid explanation exists.</P>
              <P>(2) The contracting officer shall review all available information to determine whether the contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the plan.</P>
              <P>(3) If, after consideration of all relevant information, the contracting officer determines that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the comprehensive subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision. The contracting officer's final decision shall include the right of the contractor to appeal under the Disputes clause. The contracting officer shall distribute a copy of the final decision to all cognizant contracting officers for the contracts covered under the plan.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Liquidated damages.</E> The amount of liquidated damages shall be the amount of anticipated damages sustained by the Government, including but not limited to additional expenses of administration, reporting, and contract monitoring, and shall be identified in the comprehensive subcontracting plan. Liquidated damages shall be in addition to any other remedies the Government may have.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Expiration date.</E> The Test Program expires on December 31, 2017.</P>

              <P>(a) By Partnership Agreement (PA) between the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of Defense (DoD), the SBA has delegated to the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) its authority under paragraph 8(a)(1)(A) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) to enter into 8(a) prime contracts, and its authority under 8(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act to award the performance of those contracts to eligible 8(a) Program participants. However, the SBA remains the prime contractor on all 8(a) contracts, continues to determine eligibility of concerns for contract award, and retains appeal rights under FAR 19.810. The SBA delegates only the authority to sign contracts on its behalf. Consistent with the provisions of the PA, this authority is hereby redelegated to DoD contracting officers.

              <P>(i) Before initiating any action, contact the labor advisor to obtain the opinion of the national office of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or other mediation agency regarding the effect movement of the items would have on labor negotiations. Normally removals will not be made if they will adversely affect labor negotiations.</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon the recommendation of the labor advisor, provide a written request for removal of the material to the cognizant contract administration office. Include in the request the information specified at PGI 222.101-4(a)(ii).</P>
              <P>(iii) With the assistance of the labor advisor or the commander of the contract administration office, attempt to have both the management and the labor representatives involved agree to shipment of the material by normal means.</P>
              <P>(iv) If agreement for removal of the needed items cannot be reached following the procedures in paragraphs (a) (i) through (iii) of this subsection, the commander of the contract administration office, after obtaining approval from the labor advisor, may seek the concurrence of the parties to the dispute to permit movement of the material by military vehicles with military personnel. On receipt of such concurrences, the commander may proceed to make necessary arrangements to move the material.</P>
              <P>(v) If agreement for removal of the needed items cannot be reached following any of the procedures in paragraphs (a) (i) through (iv) of this subsection, refer the matter to the labor advisor with the information required by 222.101-3-70(b). If the labor advisor is unsuccessful in obtaining concurrence of the parties for the movement of the material and further action to obtain the material is deemed necessary, refer the matter to the agency head. Upon review and verification that the items are urgently or critically needed and cannot be moved with the consent of the parties, the agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may order removal of the items from the facility.</P>

              <P>(a) Apply both the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute to installation support contracts if—</P>
              <P>(1) The contract is principally for services but also requires a substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration, renovation, painting, or repair work; and</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Service Contract Labor Standards statute coverage under the contract.</E> Contract installation support requirements, such as plant operation and installation services (i.e., custodial, snow removal, etc.) are subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards. Apply Service Contract Labor Standards clauses and minimum wage and fringe benefit requirements to all contract service calls or orders for such maintenance and support work.<PRTPAGE P="160"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute coverage under the contract.</E> Contract construction, alteration, renovation, painting, and repair requirements (i.e., roof shingling, building structural repair, paving repairs, etc.) are subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute. Apply Construction Wage Rate Requirements clauses and minimum wage requirements to all contract service calls or orders for construction, alteration, renovation, painting, or repairs to buildings or other works.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Repairs versus maintenance.</E> Some contract work may be characterized as either Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs or Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance. For example, replacing broken windows, spot painting, or minor patching of a wall could be covered by either the Construction Wage Rate Requirements or the Service Contract Labor Standards. In those instances where a contract service call or order requires construction trade skills (i.e., carpenter, plumber, painter, etc.), but it is unclear whether the work required is Service Contract Labor Standards maintenance or Construction Wage Rate Requirements painting/repairs, apply the following rules:</P>
              <P>(1) Individual service calls or orders which will require a total of 32 or more work hours to perform shall be considered to be repair work subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) Individual service calls or orders which will require less than 32 work hours to perform shall be considered to be maintenance subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards.</P>
              <P>(3) Painting work of 200 square feet or more to be performed under an individual service call or order shall be considered to be subject to the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute regardless of the total work hours required.</P>
              <P>(e) The determination of labor standards application shall be made at the time the solicitation is prepared in those cases where requirements can be identified. Otherwise, the determination shall be made at the time the service call or order is placed against the contract. The service call or order shall identify the labor standards law and contract wage determination which will apply to the work required.</P>
              <P>(f) Contracting officers may not avoid application of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute by splitting individual tasks between orders or contracts.</P>

              <P>(B) For procurements covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) has determined that it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the Buy American statute to end products that are substantially transformed in the United States.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) Normally, use the evaluation procedures in subpart 225.5, but consider recommending a public interest exception if the purposes of the Buy American statute are not served, or in order to meet a need set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2533. For example, a public interest exception may be appropriate—</P>

              <P>(b)(i) A determination that an article, material, or supply is not reasonably available is required when domestic offers are insufficient to meet the requirement and award is to be made on other than a qualifying country or eligible end product.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided in FAR 25.103(b)(3), the determination shall be approved—</P>
              <P>(A) At a level above the contracting officer for acquisitions valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;</P>

              <P>(A) Spare or replacement parts that must be acquired from the original foreign manufacturer or supplier.</P>
              <P>(B) Foreign drugs acquired by the Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia, when the Director, Pharmaceuticals Group, Directorate of Medical Materiel, determines that only the requested foreign drug will fulfill the requirements.</P>
              <P>(iv) Under coordinated acquisition (see Subpart 208.70), the determination is the responsibility of the requiring department when the requiring department specifies acquisition of a foreign end product.</P>
              <P>(c) The cost of a domestic end product is unreasonable if it is not the low evaluated offer when evaluated under Subpart 225.5.</P>

              <P>(a)(2)(A) If a department or agency considers an individual acquisition of a product to be indispensable for national security or national defense purposes and appropriate for exclusion from the provisions of FAR subpart 25.4, it may submit a request with supporting rationale to the Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (OUSD(AT&amp;L)DPAP). Approval by OUSD(AT&amp;L)DPAP is not required if—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Purchase from foreign sources is restricted by statute (see subpart 225.70);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Another exception in FAR 25.401 applies to the acquisition; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Competition from foreign sources is restricted under subpart 225.71.</P>

              <P>(B) Public interest exceptions for certain countries when acquiring products <PRTPAGE P="182"/>or services in support of operations in Afghanistan are in 225.7704-1.</P>

              <SUBJECT>End products subject to trade agreements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Acquisitions of end products in the following product service groups (PSGs) are covered by trade agreements if the value of the acquisition is at or above the applicable trade agreement threshold and no exception applies. If an end product is not in one of the listed groups, the trade agreements do not apply. The definition of Caribbean Basin country end products in FAR 25.003 excludes those end products that are not eligible for duty-free treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). Therefore certain watches, watch parts, and luggage from certain Caribbean Basin countries are not eligible products. However, 225.003 expands the definition of Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum and any product derived from petroleum, in accordance with Section 8094 of Pub. L. 103-139.</P>

              <P>(a) Whenever the acquisition is in support of operations in Afghanistan, treat the offers of end products from South Caucasus or Central and South Asian states listed in 225.401-70 the same as qualifying country offers.</P>
              <P>(b) Use the following procedures instead of the procedures in FAR 25.502(b) for acquisitions subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement:</P>
              <P>(i) Consider only offers of U.S.-made, qualifying country, or designated country end products, except as permitted by 225.403 or 225.7703-1.</P>
              <P>(ii) If price is the determining factor, award on the low offer.</P>
              <P>(c) Use the following procedures instead of those in FAR 25.502(c) for acquisitions subject to the Buy American statute or the Balance of Payments Program:</P>

              <P>(i)(A) If the acquisition is subject only to the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program, then only qualifying country end products are exempt from application of the Buy American <PRTPAGE P="184"/>or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.</P>
              <P>(B) If the acquisition is also subject to a Free Trade Agreement, then eligible products of the applicable Free Trade Agreement country are also exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor.</P>
              <P>(ii) If price is the determining factor, use the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(A) If the low offer is a domestic offer, award on that offer.</P>
              <P>(B) If there are no domestic offers, award on the low offer (see example in 225.504(1)).</P>
              <P>(C) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, award on that offer. (If the low offer is a qualifying country offer from a country listed at 225.872-1(b), execute a determination in accordance with 225.872-4.)</P>
              <P>(D) If the low offer is a foreign offer that is not exempt from application of the Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor, and there is another foreign offer that is exempt and is lower than the lowest domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer (see example in 225.504(2)).</P>
              <P>(E) Otherwise, apply the 50 percent evaluation factor to the low foreign offer.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the price of the low domestic offer is less than the evaluated price of the low foreign offer, award on the low domestic offer (see example in 225.504(3)).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the evaluated price of the low foreign offer remains less than the low domestic offer, award on the low foreign offer (see example in 225.504(4)).</P>
              <P>(iii) If price is not the determining factor, use the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(A) If there are domestic offers, apply the 50 percent Buy American or Balance of Payments Program evaluation factor to all foreign offers unless an exemption applies.</P>
              <P>(B) Evaluate in accordance with the criteria of the solicitation.</P>
              <P>(C) If these procedures will not result in award on a domestic offer, reevaluate offers without the 50 percent factor. If this will result in award on an offer to which the Buy American statute or Balance of Payments Program applies, but evaluation in accordance with paragraph (c)(ii) of this section would result in award on a domestic offer, proceed with award only after execution of a determination in accordance with 225.103(a)(ii)(B), that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the solicitation includes the provision at 252.225-7023, Preference for Products or Services from Afghanistan, use the evaluation procedures at 225.7703-3.</P>

              <P>(a) Before issuance of a solicitation, the requiring activity will notify the contracting officer in writing whether the items to be acquired are covered by the USML or the 600 series of the CCL.

Since not all items covered by the USML or 600 series of the CCL are themselves munitions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> protective personnel equipment, military training equipment), the requiring activity should consult the USML and the 600 series of the CCL before concluding that an item is or is not covered.

See guidance in PGI 225.7003-3(b)(5).</P>
              <P>(i) The Secretary of the military department concerned is authorized, without power of redelegation, to make a domestic nonavailability determination that applies to only one contract.</P>

              <P>(B) Written documentation by the requiring activity, with specificity, why such alternatives are unacceptable.</P>

              <P>(ii) A domestic nonavailability determination that applies to more than one contract (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a class domestic nonavailability determination), requires the approval of the USD(AT&amp;L).</P>
              <P>(A) At least 30 days before making a domestic nonavailability determination that would apply to more than one contract, the USD(AT&amp;L) will, to the maximum extent practicable, and in a manner consistent with the protection of national security and confidential business information—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Publish a notice on the Federal Business Opportunities Web site (<E T="03">http://www.FedBizOpps.gov</E> or any successor site) of the intent to make the domestic nonavailability determination; and</P>

              <P>(B) The USD(AT&amp;L)—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Will take into consideration all information submitted in response to the notice in making a class domestic nonavailability determination;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) May consider other relevant information that cannot be made part of the public record consistent with the protection of national security information and confidential business information; and</P>

              <P>(6) End items containing a minimal amount of otherwise noncompliant specialty metals (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> specialty metals not melted or produced in the United States that are not covered by another exception listed in this paragraph (b)), if the total weight of noncompliant specialty metal does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of all specialty metal in the end item. This exception does not apply to high performance magnets containing specialty metals. See PGI 225.7003-3(b)(6) for a table of applicability of specialty metals restrictions to magnets.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance for commercial derivative military articles.</E> The restrictions at 225.7003-2(a) do not apply to an item acquired under a prime contract if—</P>
              <P>(1) The offeror has certified, and subsequently demonstrates, that the offeror and its subcontractor(s) will individually or collectively enter into a contractual agreement or agreements to purchase a sufficient quantity of domestically melted or produced specialty metal in accordance with the provision at 252.225-7010; and</P>
              <P>(2) The USD(AT&amp;L), or the Secretary of the military department concerned, determines that the item is a commercial derivative military article (defense agencies see procedures at PGI 225.7003-3(c)). The contracting officer shall submit the offeror's certification and a request for a determination to the appropriate official, through agency channels, and shall notify the offeror when a decision has been made.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">National security waiver.</E> The USD(AT&amp;L) may waive the restrictions at 225.7003-2 if the USD(AT&amp;L) determines in writing that acceptance of the <PRTPAGE P="204"/>item is necessary to the national security interests of the United States (<E T="03">see</E> procedures at PGI 225.7003-3(d). This authority may not be delegated.</P>
              <P>(1) The written determination of the USD(AT&amp;L)—</P>
              <P>(i) Shall specify the quantity of end items to which the national security waiver applies;</P>
              <P>(ii) Shall specify the time period over which the national security waiver applies; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Shall be provided to the congressional defense committees before the determination is executed, except that in the case of an urgent national security requirement, the determination may be provided to the congressional defense committees up to 7 days after it is executed.</P>
              <P>(2) After making such a determination, the USD(AT&amp;L) will—</P>
              <P>(i) Ensure that the contractor or subcontractor responsible for the noncompliant specialty metal develops and implements an effective plan to ensure future compliance; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine whether or not the noncompliance was knowing and willful. If the USD(AT&amp;L) determines that the noncompliance was knowing and willful, the appropriate debarring and suspending official shall consider suspending or debarring the contractor or subcontractor until such time as the contractor or subcontractor has effectively addressed the issues that led to the noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(3) Because national security waivers will only be granted when the acquisition in question is necessary to the national security interests of the United States, the requirement for a plan will be applied as a condition subsequent, and not a condition precedent, to the granting of a waiver.</P>

              <P>(1)(i) The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (USD(AT&amp;L)), without power of delegation, may waive a restriction for a particular item for a particular foreign country upon determination that—</P>
              <P>(A) United States producers of the item would not be jeopardized by competition from a foreign country, and that country does not discriminate against defense items produced in the United States to a greater degree than the United States discriminates against defense items produced in that country; or</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cost of doing business with a foreign government or an international organization.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In pricing FMS contracts where non-U.S. Government prices as described in 225.7303-1 do not exist, except as provided in 225.7303-5, recognize the reasonable and allocable costs of doing business with a foreign government or international organization, even though such costs might not be recognized in the same amounts in pricing other defense contracts. Examples of such costs include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Selling expenses (not otherwise limited by FAR Part 31), such as—</P>
              <P>(i) Maintaining international sales and service organizations;</P>
              <P>(ii) Sales commissions and fees in accordance with FAR Subpart 3.4;</P>
              <P>(iii) Sales promotions, demonstrations, and related travel for sales to foreign governments. Section 126.8 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR 126.8) may require Government approval for these costs to be allowable, in which case the appropriate Government approval shall be obtained; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Configuration studies and related technical services undertaken as a direct selling effort to a foreign country.</P>
              <P>(2) Product support and post-delivery service expenses, such as—</P>
              <P>(i) Operations or maintenance training, training or tactics films, manuals, or other related data; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Technical field services provided in a foreign country related to accident investigations, weapon system problems, or operations/tactics enhancement, and related travel to foreign countries.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Offsets.</E> For additional information see 225.7306.</P>

              <P>(i) An offset agreement is the contractual arrangement between the FMS customer and the U.S. defense contractor that identifies the offset obligation imposed by the FMS customer that has been accepted by the U.S. defense contractor as a condition of the FMS customer's purchase. These agreements are distinct and independent of the LOA and the FMS contract. Further information about offsets and LOAs may be found in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M), chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.9. (<E T="03">http://samm.dsca.mil/chapter/chapter-6</E>).</P>
              <P>(ii) A U.S. defense contractor may recover all costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or international organization if the LOA is financed wholly with foreign government or international organization customer cash or repayable foreign military finance credits.</P>
              <P>(iii) The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or administer the offset agreement or to bear any of the associated costs.</P>
              <P>(iv) Indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary on the part of the contracting officer, provided that the U.S. defense contractor submits to the contracting officer a signed offset agreement or other documentation showing that the FMS customer has made the provision of an indirect offset a condition of the FMS acquisition. FMS customers are placed on notice through the LOA that indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable without any further analysis by the contracting officer.</P>
              <P>(4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the appropriate provisions of FAR part 31; or where the advance understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing, and the agreement contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. Government's own requirement (as distinguished from contracts for FMS).</P>

              <P>(b) Costs not allowable under FAR Part 31 are not allowable in pricing <PRTPAGE P="217"/>FMS contracts, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this subsection.</P>
              <P>(c) The limitations for major contractors on independent research and development and bid and proposal (IR&amp;D/B&amp;P) costs for projects that are of potential interest to DoD, in 231.205-18(c)(iii), do not apply to FMS contracts, except as provided in 225.7303-5. The allowability of IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs on contracts for FMS not wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis is limited to the contract's allocable share of the contractor's total IR&amp;D/B&amp;P expenditures. In pricing contracts for such FMS—</P>
              <P>(1) Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing; and</P>
              <P>(2) Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, in determining final cost.</P>
              <P>(d) Under paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), the United States must charge for administrative services to recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the Army Export Control Act.</P>
              <P>(e) The limitations in 231.205-1 on allowability of costs associated with leasing Government equipment do not apply to FMS contracts.</P>

              <P>In furtherance of the Military Assistance Program or for other national defense purposes, the Government may undertake to develop or encourage the development of foreign additional sources of supply. The development of such sources may be accomplished by an agreement, often called a foreign licensing agreement or technical assistance agreement, wherein a domestic concern, referred to in this subpart as a “primary source,” agrees to furnish to a foreign concern or government, herein referred to as a “second source;” foreign patent rights; technical assistance in the form of data, know-how, trained personnel of the primary source, instruction and guidance of the personnel of the second source, jigs, dies, fixtures, or other manufacturing aids, or such other assistance, information, rights, or licenses as are needed to enable the second source to produce particular supplies or perform particular services. Agreements calling for one or more of the foregoing may be entered into between the primary source and the Government, a foreign government, or a foreign concern. The consideration for providing such foreign license and technical assistance may be in the form of a lump sum payment, payments for each item manufactured by the second source, an agreement to exchange data and patent rights on improvements made to the article or service, capital stock transactions, or any combination of these. The primary source's bases for computing such consideration may include actual costs; charges for the use of patents, data, or know-how reflecting the primary source's investment in developing and engineering and production techniques; and the primary source's “price” for setting up a second source. Such agreements often refer to the compensation to be paid as a royalty or license fee whether or not patent rights are involved.</P>

              <P>It is Government policy not to pay in connection with its contracts, and not to allow to be paid in connection with contracts made with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the United States Government, charges for use of patents in which it holds a royalty-free license or charges for data which it has a right to use and disclose to others, or which is in the public domain, or which the Government has acquired without restriction upon its use and disclosure to others. This policy shall be applied by the Departments in negotiating contract prices for foreign license technical assistance contracts (227.675) or supply contracts with second sources (227.674); and in commenting on such agreements when they are referred to the Department of Defense by the Department of State pursuant to section 414 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 as amended (22 U.S.C. 1934) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675).</P>

              <P>(a) Contracts between the Government and a primary source to provide technical assistance or patent rights to a second source for the manufacture of supplies or performance of services shall, to the extent practicable, specify the rights in patents and data and any other rights to be supplied to the second source. Each contract shall provide, in connection with any separate agreement between the primary source and the second source for patent rights or technical assistance relating to the articles or services involved in the contract, that—</P>
              <P>(1) The primary source and his subcontractors shall not make, on account of any purchases by the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, any charge to the second source for royalties or amortization for patents or inventions in which the Government holds a royalty-free license; or data which the Government has the right to possess, use, and disclose to others; or any technical assistance provided to the second source for which the Government has paid under a contract between the Government and the primary source; and</P>
              <P>(2) The separate agreement between the primary and second source shall include a statement referring to the contract between the Government and the primary source, and shall conform to the requirements of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (see 227.675-1).</P>
              <P>(b) The following factors, among others, shall be considered in negotiating the price to be paid the primary source under contracts within (a) of this section:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Review of agreements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In reviewing foreign license and technical assistance agreements between primary and second sources, the Department concerned shall, insofar as its interests are involved, indicate whether the agreement meets the requirements of §§ 124.07-124.10 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations or in what respects it is deficient. Paragraphs (b) through (g) of this subsection provide general guidance.</P>
              <P>(b) When it is reasonably anticipated that the Government will purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the agreement, or that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided for the procurement of the supplies or services, the following guidance applies.</P>
              <P>(1) If the agreement specifies a reduction in charges thereunder, with respect to purchases by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, in recognition of the Government's rights in patents and data, the Department concerned shall evaluate the amount of the reduction to determine whether it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances, before indicating its approval.</P>
              <P>(2) If the agreement does not specify any reduction in charges or otherwise fails to give recognition to the Government's rights in the patents or data involved, approval shall be conditioned upon amendment of the agreement to reflect a reduction, evaluated by the Department concerned as acceptable to the Government, in any charge thereunder with respect to purchases made by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government, in accordance with § 124.10 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the second source for data or patent rights to the extent of the Government's rights, the Department concerned shall evaluate the acceptability of the provision before indicating its approval.</P>
              <P>(4) If time or circumstances do not permit the evaluation called for in (b) (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the guidance in (c) of this subsection shall be followed.</P>
              <P>(c) When it is not reasonably anticipated that the Government will purchase from the second source the supplies or services involved in the agreement nor that Military Assistance Program funds will be provided for the purchase of the supplies or services, then the following guidance applies.</P>
              <P>(1) If the agreement provides for charges to the second source for data or patent rights, it may suffice to fulfill the requirements of § 124.10 insofar as the Department of Defense is concerned if:</P>
              <P>(i) The agreement requires the second source to advise the primary source when he has knowledge of any purchase made or to be made from him by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government;</P>
              <P>(ii) The primary source separately agrees with the Government that upon such advice to him from the second source or from the Government or otherwise as to any such a purchase or prospective purchase, he will negotiate with the Department concerned an appropriate reduction in his charges to the second source in recognition of any Government rights in patents or data; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The agreement between the primary and second sources further provides that in the event of any such purchase and resulting reduction in charges, the second source shall pass on this reduction to the Government by giving the Government a corresponding reduction in the purchase price of the article or service.</P>

              <P>(2) If the agreement provides that no charge is to be made to the second source for data or patent rights to the <PRTPAGE P="235"/>extent to which the Government has rights, the Department concerned shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Evaluate the acceptability of the provision before indicating its approval; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Explicitly condition its approval on the right to evaluate the acceptability of the provision at a later time.</P>
              <P>(d) When there is a technical assistance agreement between the primary source and the Government related to the agreement between the primary and second sources that is under review, the latter agreement shall reflect the arrangements contemplated with respect thereto by the Government's technical assistance agreement with the primary source.</P>
              <P>(e) Every agreement shall provide that any license rights transferred under the agreement are subject to existing rights of the Government.</P>
              <P>(f) In connection with every agreement referred to in (b) of this section, a request shall be made to the primary source—</P>
              <P>(1) To identify the patents, data, and other technical assistance to be provided to the second source by the primary source or any of his subcontractors,</P>
              <P>(2) To identify any such patents and data in which, to the knowledge of the primary source, the Government may have rights, and</P>
              <P>(3) To segregate the charges made to the second source for each such category or item of patents, data, and other technical assistance.</P>
              <FP>Reviewing personnel shall verify this information or, where the primary source does not furnish it, obtain such information from Governmental sources so far as practicable.</FP>
              <P>(g) The Department concerned shall make it clear that its approval of any agreement does not necessarily recognize the propriety of the charges or the amounts thereof, or constitute approval of any of the business arrangements in the agreement, unless the Department expressly intends by its approval to commit itself to the fairness and reasonableness of a particular charge or charges. In any event, a disclaimer should be made to charges or business terms not affecting any purchase made by or for the Government or by others with funds derived through the Military Assistance Program or otherwise through the Government.</P>

The clause at 252.227-7009 is a sample for expressing reporting and payment of royalties requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) Where more than one Department or Government Agency is licensed and there is a ceiling on the royalties payable in any reporting period, the licensing Departments or Agencies shall coordinate with respect to the pro rata share of royalties to be paid by each.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">License to other government agencies.</E> When it is intended that a license on the same terms and conditions be available to other departments and agencies of the Government, the clause at 252.227-7010 is an example which may be used.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Acquisition of technical data.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Contracting officers shall work closely with data managers and requirements personnel to assure that data requirements included in solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7103-1.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the Government's minimum needs for technical data. Data needs must be established giving consideration to the contractor's economic interests in data pertaining to items, components, or processes that have been developed at private expense; the Government's costs to acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and protect the data; reprocurement needs; repair, maintenance and overhaul philosophies; spare and repair part considerations; and whether procurement of the items, components, or processes can be accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis. When it is anticipated that the Government will obtain unlimited or government purpose rights in technical data that will be required for competitive spare or repair parts procurements, such data should be identified as deliverable data items. Reprocurement needs may not be a sufficient reason to acquire detailed manufacturing or process data when items or components can be acquired using performance specifications, form, fit and function data, or when there are a sufficient number of alternate sources which can reasonably be expected to provide such items on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.</P>
              <P>(2) When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for data, data managers must balance the original assessment of the Government's data needs with data prices contained in the offer.</P>
              <P>(c) Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that, wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts—</P>
              <P>(1) Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be delivered under the contract and the format and media in which the data will be delivered;</P>
              <P>(2) Establish each deliverable data item as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by listing each deliverable data item on an exhibit to the contract);</P>
              <P>(3) Identify the prices established for each deliverable data item under a fixed-price type contract;</P>
              <P>(4) Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable data item; and</P>
              <P>(5) Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item of technical data.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Early identification of technical data to be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, reproduction or disclosure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 requires, to the maximum extent practicable, an identification prior to delivery of any technical data to be delivered to the Government with restrictions on use.</P>
              <P>(b) Use the provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, in all solicitations that include the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items. The provision requires offerors to identify any technical data for which restrictions, other than copyright, on use, release, or disclosure are asserted and to attach the identification and assertions to the offer.</P>

              <P>(c) Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7013 permits a contractor, under certain conditions, to <PRTPAGE P="243"/>make additional assertions of use, release, or disclosure restrictions. The prescription for the use of that clause and its alternate is at 227.7103-6 (a) and (b).</P>

              <SUBJECT>License rights.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Grant of license.</E> The Government obtains rights in technical data, including a copyright license, under and irrevocable license granted or obtained for the Government by the contractor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the data not granted to the Government. For technical data that pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the item, component, or process. When the technical data do not pertain to items, components, or processes, the scope of the license is determined by the source of funds used to create the data.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Techical data pertaining to items, components, or processes.</E> Contractors or licensors may, with some exceptions (see 227.7103-5(a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9)), restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense (limited rights). They may not restrict the Government's rights in items, components, or processes developed exclusively at Government expense (unlimited rights) without the Government's approval. When an item, component, or process is developed with mixed funding, the Government may use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display or disclose the data pertaining to such items, components, or processes within the Government without restriction but may release or disclose the data outside the Government only for government purposes (government purpose rights).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Technical data that do not pertain to items, components, or processes.</E> Technical data may be created during the performance of a contract for a conceptual design or similar effort that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components or processes. The Government generally obtains unlimited rights in such data when the data were created exclusively with Government funds, government purpose rights when the data were created with mixed funding, and limited rights when the data were created exclusively at private expense.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Source of funds determination.</E> The determination of the source of development funds for technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes should be made at any practical sub-item or subcomponent level or for any segregable portion of a process. Contractors may assert limited rights in a segregable sub-item, sub-component, or portion of a process which otherwise qualifies for limited rights under the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Government rights.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or limited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items. In unusual situations, the standards rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Unlimited rights.</E> The Government obtains unlimited rights in technical data that are—</P>
              <P>(1) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;</P>

              <P>(2) Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced in the performance of a contract when the study, analysis, test, or similar work was specified as an element of performance;<PRTPAGE P="244"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;</P>
              <P>(4) Form, fit, and function data;</P>
              <P>(5) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);</P>
              <P>(6) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the contractor by the Government;</P>
              <P>(7) Publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;</P>
              <P>(8) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or</P>
              <P>(9) Data furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—</P>
              <P>(i) Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Government purpose rights.</E> (1) The Government obtains government purpose rights in technical data—</P>
              <P>(i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed with mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.</P>
              <P>(2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7013 provides a nominal five-year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the technical data without consideration from either party. Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not provide sufficient time to apply the data for commercial purposes or when necessary to recognize subcontractors' interests in the data.</P>
              <P>(3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required the development. Upon expiration of the Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data including the right to authorize others to use the data for commercial purposes.</P>
              <P>(4) During the government purpose rights period, the government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, technical data marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or disclose data in which it has government purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless—</P>
              <P>(i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.</P>
              <P>(5) When technical data marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252-227-7025, the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.</P>

              <P>(6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that technical data marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and <PRTPAGE P="245"/>non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights data. Documents transmitting government purpose rights data to persons under class agreements shall identify the technical data subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such data are provided.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limited rights.</E> (1) The Government obtains limited rights in technical data—</P>
              <P>(i) That pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this subsection; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.</P>
              <P>(2) Data in which the Government has limited rights may not be used, released, or disclosed outside the Government without the permission of the contractor asserting the restriction except for a use, release, or disclosure that is—</P>
              <P>(i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</P>
              <P>(ii) To a covered Government support contractor; or</P>
              <P>(iii) To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes.</P>
              <P>(3) The person asserting limited rights must be notified of the Government's intent to release, disclose, or authorize others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data except notification of an intended release, disclosure, or use for emergency repair or overhaul which shall be made as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(4) When the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, disclose, or have others use the data subject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, the intended recipient must complete the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7, or receive the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, prior to release or disclosure of the limited rights data.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Specifically negotiated license rights.</E> (1) Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the government or when the government wants to obtain rights in data in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, including logistics support and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement. The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or government purpose rights in data but may not accept less than limited rights in such data. The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the Government has to release or disclose the data to other persons or to authorize others to use the data. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.</P>

              <P>(2) When the Government needs additional rights in data acquired with government purpose or limited rights, the contracting officer must negotiate with the contractor to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. Generally, such negotiations should be conducted only when there is a need to disclose the data outside the Government or if the additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement and the anticipated savings expected to be obtained through competition are estimated to exceed the acquisition cost of <PRTPAGE P="246"/>the additional rights. Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider alternatives such as—</P>
              <P>(i) Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or processes;</P>
              <P>(ii) Obtaining a contractor's contractual commitment to qualify additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Reverse engineering, or providing items from Government inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Deferred delivery.</E> Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the Government's interests to defer the delivery of technical data. The clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of technical data identified as “deferred delivery” data at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such technical data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify which technical data is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such data to permit timely delivery.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Deferred ordering.</E> Use the clause at 252.227-7027, Deferred Ordering of Technical Data or Computer Software, when a firm requirement for a particular data item(s) has not been established prior to contract award but there is a potential need for the data. Under this clause, the contracting officer may order any data that has been generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver <PRTPAGE P="249"/>such data expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the data are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the data into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Copyright license.</E> (1) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, requires a contractor to grant or obtain for the Government license rights which permit the Government to reproduce data, distribute copies of the data, publicly perform or display the data or, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works. The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in technical data will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data.</P>
              <P>(2) The clause at 252.227-7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted data into a deliverable data item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted data in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contractor identification and marking of technical data to be furnished with restrictive markings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identification requirements.</E> (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify to the contracting officer, prior to contract award, any technical data that the offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306. An offeror's failure to correct the informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.</P>
              <P>(2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13.</P>

              <P>(3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.7103-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, permits the contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions <PRTPAGE P="250"/>must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.</P>
              <P>(4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor, nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7103-13, the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.</P>
              <P>(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose technical data. However, offerors shall not be prohibited from offering products for which the offeror is entitled to provide the Government limited rights in the technical data pertaining to such products and offerors shall not be required, either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish any greater rights in technical data when the offeror is entitled to provide the technical data with limited rights.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contractor marking requirements.</E> The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items—</P>
              <P>(1) Requires a contractor that desires to restrict the Government's rights in technical data to place restrictive markings on the data, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings; and</P>
              <P>(2) Requires a contractor to deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any technical data in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the Government's pre-existing rights in that data unless the parties have agreed otherwise or restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the data have expired. When restrictions are still applicable, the contractor is permitted to mark the data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Unmarked technical data.</E> (1) Technical data delivered or otherwise provided under a contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and may be released or disclosed without restriction. To the extent practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the technical data pending evaluation of the request.</P>
              <P>(2) A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on unmarked technical data at its expense. The request must be received by the contracting officer within six months following the furnishing or delivery of such data, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer. The person making the request must:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify the technical data that should have been marked;</P>
              <P>(ii) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of technical data contained in the clause at 252.227-7013; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the technical data made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.</P>
              <P>(3) Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the technical data were not distributed outside the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.</P>

              <P>(a) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain <PRTPAGE P="251"/>records to justify the validity of asserted restrictions on delivered data.</P>
              <P>(b) The clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data requires contractors and their subcontractors at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of restrictive markings on technical data delivered or to be delivered under a Government contract.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Government right to establish conformity of markings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Nonconforming markings.</E> (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227-7013 is also a nonconforming marking.</P>
              <P>(2) The correction of nonconforming markings on technical data is not subject to 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return technical data bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on such data to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming marking at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected data within 60 days following the person's receipt of the data, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at that person's expense. When it is impracticable to return technical data for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction, the data may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Unjustified markings.</E> (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical data. For example, a limited rights legend placed on technical data pertaining to items, components, or processes that were developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.</P>
              <P>(2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either—</P>
              <P>(i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Return the technical data to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the data are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected data to the contracting officer within 60 days following receipt of the data, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An offeror's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose technical data do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in the technical data. Under 10 U.S.C. 2321, the Government has the right to challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of the assertion and continued adherence to the assertion would make it impractical to later procure competitively the item to which the data pertain.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Pre-award considerations.</E> The challenge procedures required by 10 U.S.C. 2321 could significantly delay awards under competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.<PRTPAGE P="252"/>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Challenge considerations and presumption.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Requirements to initiate a challenge.</E> Contracting officers shall have reasonable grounds to challenge the validity of an asserted restriction. Before issuing a challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the assertion. The contracting officer shall not challenge a contractor's assertion that a commercial item was developed exclusively at private expense unless the Government can demonstrate that it contributed to development of that item.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense.</E> 10 U.S.C. 2320(b)(1) and 2321(f) establish a presumption and procedures regarding validation of asserted restrictions for technical data related to commercial items, and to major systems, on the basis of development exclusively at private expense.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Commercial items.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, contracting officers shall presume that a commercial item was developed exclusively at private expense whether or not a contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to a challenge notice. When a challenge is warranted, a contractor's or subcontractor's failure to respond to the challenge notice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Major weapon systems.</E> When the contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction regarding technical data for a major weapon system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the technology was not developed exclusively at private expense—</P>
              <P>(A) The presumption in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section applies to—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A commercial subsystem or component of a major weapon system, if the major weapon system was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(a));</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A component of a subsystem, if the subsystem was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(b)); and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Any other component, if the component is a commercially available off-the-shelf item or a commercially available off-the-shelf item with modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace or minor modifications made to meet Federal Government requirements; and</P>
              <P>(B) In all other cases, the contracting officer shall sustain the challenge unless information provided by the contractor or subcontractor demonstrates that the item was developed exclusively at private expense.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Challenge and validation.</E> All challenges shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Challenge period.</E> Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of technical data deliverable under the contract. Assertions must be challenged within three years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the data, whichever is later. However, restrictive markings may be challenged at any time if the technical data—</P>
              <P>(i) Are publicly available without restrictions;</P>
              <P>(ii) Have been provided to the United States without restriction; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Have been otherwise made available without restriction other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Pre-challenge requests for information.</E> (i) After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to ascertain the basis of the restrictive markings. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by the person making the assertion does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.<PRTPAGE P="253"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) If the person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information or additional supporting documentation, or if the information submitted or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking does not justify the asserted restriction, a challenge should be considered.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Transacting matters directly with subcontracts.</E> The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—</P>
              <P>(i) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor;</P>
              <P>(ii) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or suppliers right to assert restrictions; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Challenge notice.</E> The contracting officer shall not issue a challenge notice unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of an assertion. The contracting officer may challenge an assertion whether or not supporting documentation was requested under paragraph (d)(2) of this subsection. Challenge notices shall be in writing and issued to the contractor or, after consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection, the person asserting the restriction. The challenge notice shall include the information in paragraph (e) of the clause at 252.227-7037.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Extension of response time.</E> The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge notice, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Contracting officer's final decision.</E> Contracting officers must issue a final decision for each challenged assertion, whether or not the assertion has been justified.</P>
              <P>(i) A contracting officer's final decision that an assertion is not justified must be issued a soon as practicable following the failure of the person asserting the restriction to respond to the contracting officer's challenge within 60 days, or any extension to that time granted by the contracting officer.</P>
              <P>(ii) A contracting officer who, following a challenge and response by the person asserting the restriction, determines that an asserted restriction is justified, shall issue a final decision sustaining the validity of the asserted restriction. If the asserted restriction was made subsequent to submission of the contractor's offer, add the asserted restriction to the contract attachment.</P>
              <P>(iii) A contracting officer who determine that the validity of an asserted restriction has not been justified shall issue a contracting officer's final decision within the time frames prescribed in 252.227-7037. As provided in paragraph (g) of that clause, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction.</E> When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Validation.</E> Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency board of contract appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, that <PRTPAGE P="254"/>sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the asserted restriction.</P>

              <P>(1) Provides for the establishment of remedies applicable to technical data found to be incomplete, inadequate, or not to satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning such data; and</P>
              <P>(2) Authorizes agency heads to withhold payments (or exercise such other remedies an agency head considers appropriate) during any period if the contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract pertaining to the delivery of technical data.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Conformity and acceptance.</E> (1) Solicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of technical data shall specify the requirements the data must satisfy to be acceptable. Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) The clause at 252.227-7030, Technical Data—Withholding of Payment, provides for withholding up to 10 percent of the contract price pending correction or replacement of the nonconforming technical data or negotiation of an equitable reduction in contract price. The amount subject to withholding may be expressed as a fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of the contract price. In either case, the amount shall be determined giving consideration to the relative value and importance of the data. For example—</P>
              <P>(i) When the sole purpose of a contract is to produce the data, the relative value of that data may be considerably higher than the value of data produced under a contract where the production of the data is a secondary objective; or</P>
              <P>(ii) When the Government will maintain or repair items, repair and maintenance data may have a considerably higher relative value than data that merely describe the item or provide performance characteristics.</P>
              <P>(3) Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the contractual requirements in all respects. Except for nonconforming restrictive markings (see paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection), correction or replacement of nonconforming data or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government's interests, shall be accomplished in accordance with—</P>
              <P>(i) The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for nonconforming deliverables.</P>
              <P>(4) Follow the procedures at 227.7103-12(a)(2) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason technical data fail to conform to contractual requirements. The clause at 252.227-7030 may be used to withhold an amount for payment, consistent with the terms of the clause, pending correction of the nonconforming markings.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Warranty.</E> (1) The intended use of the technical data and the cost, if any, to obtain the warranty should be considered before deciding to obtain a data warranty (see FAR 46.703). The fact that a particular item, component, or process is or is not warranted is not a consideration in determining whether or not to obtain a warranty for the technical data that pertain to the item, component, or process.

              <SUBJECT>Subcontractor rights in technical data.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) 10 U.S.C. 2320 provides subcontractors at all tiers the same protection for their rights in data as is provided to prime contractors. The clauses at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, and 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, implement the statutory requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) 10 U.S.C. 2321 permits a subcontractor to transact directly with the Government matters relating to the validation of its asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose technical data. The clause at 252.227-7037 obtains a contractor's agreement that the direct transaction of validation or challenge matters with subcontractors at any tier does not establish or imply privity of contract. When a subcontractor or supplier exercise its right to transact validation matters directly with the Government, contracting officers shall deal directly with such persons, as provided at 227.7103-13(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(c) Require prime contractors whose contracts include the following clauses to include those clauses, without modification except for appropriate identification of the parties, in contracts with subcontractors or suppliers, at all tiers, who will be furnishing technical data for non-commercial items in response to a Government requirement:</P>
              <P>(1) 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items;</P>
              <P>(2) 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;</P>
              <P>(3) 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government; and</P>
              <P>(4) 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data.</P>
              <P>(d) Do not require contractors to have their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier relinquish rights in technical data to the contractor, a higher tier subcontractor, or to the Government, as a condition for award of any contract, subcontract, purchase order, or similar instrument except for the rights obtained by the Government under the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause contained in the contractor's contract with the Government.</P>

              <P>(a) The clause at 252.227-7032, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software (Foreign), may be used in contracts with foreign contractors to be performed overseas, except Canadian purchases (see paragraph (c) of this subsection), in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, when the Government requires the unrestricted right to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release or disclose all technical data to be delivered under the contract. Do not use the clause in contracts for existing or special works.</P>

              <P>(b) When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the clause at <PRTPAGE P="256"/>252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain rights in the technical data that are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under the data rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.</P>
              <P>(c) Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate data rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.</P>

              <P>(b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in a special work under the clause at 252.227-7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also <PRTPAGE P="258"/>negotiate a special license which specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.</P>
              <P>(c) The clause at 252.227-7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any works copyrighted by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, to perform or display publicly any portion of the work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes.

              <SUBJECT>License rights.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Grant of license.</E> The Government obtains rights in computer software or computer software documentation, including a copyright license, under an irrevocable license granted or obtained by the contractor which developed the software or documentation or the licensor of the software or documentation if the development contractor is not the licensor. The contractor or licensor retains all rights in the software or documentation not granted to the Government. The scope of a computer software license is generally determined by the source of funds used to develop the software. Contractors or <PRTPAGE P="262"/>licensors may, with some exceptions, restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software developed exclusively or partially at private expense (see 227.7203-5 (b) and (c)). They may not, without the Government's agreement (see 227.7203-5(d)), restrict the Government's rights in computer software developed exclusively with Government funds or in computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Source of funds determination.</E> The determination of the source of funds used to develop computer software should be made at the lowest practicable segregable portion of the software or documentation (e.g., a software sub-routine that performs a specific function). Contractors may assert restricted rights in a segregable portion of computer software which otherwise qualifies for restricted rights under the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Government rights.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The standard license rights in computer software that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited rights, government purpose rights, or restricted rights. The standard license in computer software documentation conveys unlimited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. In unusual situations, the standard rights may not satisfy the Government's needs or the Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in return for other consideration. In those cases, a special license may be negotiated. However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights and the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license. The situations under which a particular grant of license applies are enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Unlimited rights.</E> The Government obtains an unlimited rights license in—</P>
              <P>(1) Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;</P>
              <P>(2) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a Government contract;</P>
              <P>(3) Corrections or changes to computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the contractor by the Government;</P>
              <P>(4) Computer software or computer software documentation that is otherwise publicly available or has been released or disclosed by the contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or it assets to another party;</P>
              <P>(5) Computer software or computer software documentation obtained with unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or</P>
              <P>(6) Computer software or computer software documentation furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract with—</P>
              <P>(i) Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in technical data, or government purpose license rights and the restrictive conditions have expired; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Government purpose rights and the contractor's exclusive right to use such software or documentation for commercial purposes has expired.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Government purpose rights.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the Government obtains government purpose rights in computer software developed with mixed funding.</P>

              <P>(2) The period during which government purpose rights are effective is negotiable. The clause at 252.227-7014 provides a nominal five-year period. Either party may request a different period. Changes to the government purpose rights period may be made at any time prior to delivery of the software without consideration from either party. Longer periods should be negotiated when a five-year period does not <PRTPAGE P="263"/>provide sufficient time to commercialize the software or, for software developed by subcontractors, when necessary to recognize the subcontractors' interests in the software.</P>
              <P>(3) The government purpose rights period commences upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the computer software. Upon expiration of the government purpose rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the software including the right to authorize others to use data for commercial purposes.</P>
              <P>(4) During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, or authorize other persons to use, computer software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes. The Government shall not release or disclose, or authorize others to release or disclose, computer software in which it has government purpose rights to any person unless—</P>
              <P>(i) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The intended recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.</P>
              <P>(5) When computer software marked with government purpose rights legends will be released or disclosed to a Government contractor performing a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227-7025, the contract may be modified, prior to release or disclosure, to include such clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and non-disclosure agreement.</P>
              <P>(6) Contracting activities shall establish procedures to assure that computer software or computer software documentation marked with government purpose rights legends are released or disclosed, including a release or disclosure through a Government solicitation, only to persons subject to the use and non-disclosure restrictions. Public announcements in the Commerce Business Daily or other publications must provide notice of the use and non-disclosure requirements. Class use and non-disclosure agreements (e.g., agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) are authorized and may be obtained at any time prior to release or disclosure of the government purpose rights software or documentation. Documents transmitting government purpose rights software or documentation to persons under class agreements shall identify the specific software or documentation subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement under which such software or documentation are provided.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restricted rights.</E> (1) The Government obtains restricted rights in noncommercial computer software, required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Government under a contract, that was developed exclusively at private expense.</P>
              <P>(2) Contractors are not required to provide the Government additional rights in computer software delivered or otherwise provided to the Government with restricted rights. When the Government has a need for additional rights, the Government must negotiate with the contractor to determine if there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. List or describe all software in which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights in a license agreement made part of the contract (see paragraph (d) of this subsection). The license shall enumerate the specific additional rights granted to the Government.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Specifically negotiated license rights.</E> Negotiate specific licenses when the parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when the Government wants to obtain rights in computer software in which it does not have rights. When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government's rights in computer software, consider the planned software maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors which may have relevance for a particular procurement. If negotiating to <PRTPAGE P="264"/>relinquish rights in computer software documentation, consider the administrative burden associated with protecting documentation subject to restrictions from unauthorized release or disclosure. The negotiated license rights must stipulate the rights granted the Government to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the software or documentation and the extent to which the Government may authorize others to do so. Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement made part of the contract.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Rights in derivative computer software or computer software documentation.</E> The clause at 252.227-7014 protects the Government's rights in computer software, computer software documentation, or portions thereof that the contractor subsequently uses to prepare derivative software or subsequently embeds or includes in other software or documentation. The Government retains the rights it obtained under the development contract in the unmodified portions of the derivative software or documentation.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Use the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, in solicitations and contracts when the successful offeror(s) will be required to deliver computer software or computer software documentation. Do not use the clause when the only deliverable items are technical data (other than computer software documentation), commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation, commercial items (see 227.7102-3), special works (see 227.7205), or contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research Program (see 227.7104), Except as provided in 227.7107-2, do not use the clause in architect-engineer and construction contracts.</P>
              <P>(2) Use the clause at 252.227-7014 with its Alternate I in research contracts when the contracting officer determines, in consultation with counsel, that public dissemination by the contractor would be—</P>
              <P>(i) In the interest of the Government; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Facilitated by the Government relinquishing its right to publish the work for sale, or to have others publish the work for sale on behalf of the Government.</P>
              <P>(b) Use the clause at 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014.</P>
              <P>(c) Use the clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014. The clause provides procedures for the validation of asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, release, or disclose computer software.</P>
              <P>(d) Use the provision at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends, in solicitations and contracts when it is anticipated that the Government will provide the contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014), for performance of its contract, computer software or computer software documentation marked with another contractor's restrictive legend(s).</P>
              <P>(e) Use the provision at 252.227-7028, Technical Data or Computer Software Previously Delivered to the Government, in solicitations when the resulting contract will require the contractor to deliver computer software or computer software documentation. The provision requires offerors to identify any software or documentation specified in the solicitation as deliverable items that are the same or substantially the same as software or documentation which the offeror has delivered or is obligated to deliver, either as a contractor or subcontractor, under any other federal agency contract.</P>

              <P>(f) Use the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, in solicitations and contracts that include the clause at 252.227-7014 when the contractor will be required to deliver noncommercial computer software documentation (technical data).

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Deferred delivery.</E> Use the clause at 252.227-7026, Deferred Delivery of Technical Data or Computer Software, when it is in the Government's interests to defer the delivery of computer software or computer software documentation. The clause permits the contracting officer to require the delivery of data identified as “deferred delivery” data or computer software at any time until two years after acceptance by the Government of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors or suppliers to deliver such data expires two years after the date the prime contractor accepts the last item from the subcontractor or supplier for use in the performance of the contract. The contract must specify the computer software or computer software documentation that is subject to deferred delivery. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor sufficiently in advance of the desired delivery date for such software or documentation to permit timely delivery.</P>

Under this clause the contracting officer may order any computer software or computer software documentation generated in the performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder at any time until three years after acceptance of all items (other than technical data or computer software) under the contract or contract termination, whichever is later. The obligation of subcontractors to deliver such technical data or computer software expires three years after the date the contractor accepts the last item under the subcontract. When the software or documentation are ordered, the delivery dates shall be negotiated and the contractor compensated only for converting the software or documentation into the prescribed form, reproduction costs, and delivery costs.</P>

The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obtained under the clause. When non-standard license rights in computer software or computer software documentation will be negotiated, negotiate the extent of the copyright license concurrent with negotiations for the data rights license. Do not negotiate copyright licenses for computer software that provide less rights than the standard restricted rights in computer software license. For computer software documentation, do not negotiate a copyright license that provides less rights than the standard limited rights in technical data license.</P>

              <P>(2) The clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items, does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted software into a deliverable software item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted software in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the <PRTPAGE P="266"/>third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identification requirements.</E> (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions, requires offerors to identify, prior to contract award, any computer software or computer software documentation that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the attachment or fails to complete the attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.306(a). An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award.</P>
              <P>(2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13.</P>
              <P>(3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.7203-13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the computer software or computer software documentation, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017. Subsequent to contract award, the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, permits a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause.</P>
              <P>(4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.7203-13, the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.</P>
              <P>(5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision at 252.227-7017 may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use or disclose computer software or computer software documentation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contractor marking requirements.</E> The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation—</P>
              <P>(1) Requires a contractor who desires to restrict the Government's rights in computer software or computer software documentation to place restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is anticipated that the software will or may be used in combat or situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors to insert instructions into computer programs that interfere with or delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend or other license notice; and</P>

              <P>(a) The clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation, requires a contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, to establish and follow written procedures to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized and to maintain records to justify the validity of restrictive markings.</P>
              <P>(b) The clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, requires contractors and their subcontractors or suppliers at any tier to maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of markings that assert restrictions on the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of computer software.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Government right to establish conformity of markings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Nonconforming markings.</E> (1) Authorized markings are identified in the clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation. All other markings are nonconforming markings. An authorized marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements in the clause at 252.227-7014 is also a nonconforming marking.</P>

              <P>(2) The correction of nonconforming markings on computer software is not subject to 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and the correction of nonconforming markings on computer software documentation (technical data) is not subject to 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data. To the extent practicable, the contracting officer should return computer software or computer software <PRTPAGE P="268"/>documentation bearing nonconforming markings to the person who has placed the nonconforming markings on the software or documentation to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming markings at that person's expense. If that person fails to correct the nonconformity and return the corrected software or documentation within 60 days following the person's receipt of the software or documentation, the contracting officer may correct or strike the nonconformity at the person's expense. When it is impracticable to return computer software or computer software documentation for correction, contracting officers may unilaterally correct any nonconforming markings at Government expense. Prior to correction, the software or documentation may be used in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Unjustified markings.</E> (1) An unjustified marking is an authorized marking that does not depict accurately restrictions applicable to the Government's use, modification, reproduction, release, or disclosure of the marked computer software or computer software documentation. For example, a restricted rights legend placed on computer software developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.</P>
              <P>(2) Contracting officers have the right to review and challenge the validity of unjustified markings. However, at any time during performance of a contract and notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified. Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may, at his or her election, either—</P>
              <P>(i) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person's expense; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Return the computer software or computer software documentation to the person asserting the restriction for correction at that person's expense. If the software or documentation are returned and that person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software or documentation to the contracting officer within 60 days following receipt of the software or documentation, the unjustified marking shall be corrected or stricken at that person's expense.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate asserted restrictions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An offeror's or contractor's assertion(s) of restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government's rights in such software or documentation. The Government may require an offeror or contractor to submit sufficient information to permit an evaluation of a particular asserted restriction and may challenge asserted restrictions when there are reasonable grounds to believe that an assertion is not valid.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests for information.</E> Contracting officers should have a reason to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be correct prior to requesting information. When requesting information, provide the offeror or contractor the reason(s) for suspecting that an asserted restriction might not be correct. A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for requesting information concerning an asserted restriction. Follow the procedures at 227.7203-5(d) when additional license rights are needed but there is no basis to suspect that an asserted restriction might not be valid.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Transacting matters directly with subcontractors.</E> The clause at 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, obtains the contractor's agreement that the Government may transact matters under the clause directly with a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, without creating or implying privity of contract. Contracting officers should permit a subcontractor or supplier to transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when—<PRTPAGE P="269"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) A subcontractor's or supplier's business interests in its technical data would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor.</P>
              <P>(2) There is reason to believe that the contractor will not respond in a timely manner to a challenge and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor's or supplier's right to assert restrictions; or</P>
              <P>(3) Requested to do so by a subcontractor or supplier.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Challenging asserted restrictions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Pre-award considerations.</E> The challenge procedures in the clause at 252.227-7019 could significantly delay competitive procurements. Therefore, avoid challenging asserted restrictions prior to a competitive contract award unless resolution of the assertion is essential for successful completion of the procurement.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer software documentation.</E> Computer software documentation is technical data. Challenges to asserted restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software documentation must be made in accordance with the clause at 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, and the guidance at 227.7103-13. The procedures in the clause at 252.227-7037 implement requirements contained in 10 U.S.C. 2321. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7103-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Computer software.</E> (i) Asserted restrictions should be reviewed before acceptance of the computer software deliverable under a contract. The Government's right to challenge an assertion expires three years after final payment under the contract or three years after delivery of the software, whichever is later. Those limitations on the Government's challenge rights do not apply to software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions.</P>
              <P>(ii) Contracting officers must have reasonable grounds to challenge the current validity of an asserted restriction. Before challenging an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information pertaining to the asserted restrictions. Resolution of questions regarding the validity of asserted restrictions using the process described at 227.7203-12(b)(2) is strongly encouraged. After consideration of the situations described in paragraph (c) of this subsection, contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in sufficient detail to enable the contracting officer to determine the validity of the assertion. Additional supporting documentation may be requested when the explanation provided by that person does not, in the contracting officer's opinion, establish the validity of the assertion.</P>
              <P>(iii) Assertions may be challenged whether or not supporting documentation was requested. Challenges must be in writing and issued to the person asserting the restriction.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Extension of response time.</E> The contracting officer, at his or her discretion, may extend the time for response contained in a challenge, as appropriate, if the contractor submits a timely written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Validating or denying asserted restrictions.</E> (1) Contracting officers must promptly issue a final decision denying or sustaining the validity of each challenged assertion unless the parties have agreed on the disposition of the assertion. When a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction is made following a timely response to a challenge, the Government is obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit the Government to continue to respect the asserted restriction. See 252.227-7019(g) for restrictions applicable following a determination of urgent and compelling circumstances.</P>

              <P>(2) Only a contracting officer's final decision, or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction, that sustain the <PRTPAGE P="270"/>validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction.</E> When more than one contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges. That contracting officer shall consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue a schedule that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.</P>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Covered segment</E> means a product division of the contractor that allocated more than $1,100,000 in independent research and development and bid and proposal (IR&amp;D/B&amp;P) costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. In the case of a contractor that has no product divisions, the term means that contractor as a whole. A product division of the contractor that allocated less than $1,100,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this subsection.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Major contractor</E> means any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11,000,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year. For purposes of calculating the dollar threshold amounts to determine whether a contractor meets the definition of “major contractor,” do not include contractor segments allocating less than $1,100,000 of IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Allowability.</E> (i) Departments/agencies shall not supplement this regulation in any way that limits IR&amp;D/B&amp;P cost allowability.</P>

              <P>(C) For annual IR&amp;D costs to be allowable—</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The IR&amp;D projects generating the costs must be reported to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) using the DTIC's online input form and instructions at <E T="03">http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/;</E>

              <SUBJECT>External restructuring costs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This subsection—</P>
              <P>(1) Prescribes policies and procedures for allowing contractor external restructuring costs when savings would result for DoD; and</P>
              <P>(2) Implements 10 U.S.C. 2325.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this subsection:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Business combination</E> means a transaction whereby assets or operations of two or more companies not previously under common ownership or control are combined, whether by merger, acquisition, or sale/purchase of assets.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">External restructuring activities</E> means restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of companies not previously under common ownership or control. They do not include restructuring activities occurring after a business combination that affect the operations of only one of the companies not previously under common ownership or control, or, when there has been no business combination, restructuring activities undertaken within one company. External restructuring activities are a direct outgrowth of a business combination. They normally will be initiated within 3 years of the business combination.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Restructuring activities</E> means nonroutine, nonrecurring, or extraordinary activities to combine facilities, operations, or workforce, in order to eliminate redundant capabilities, improve future operations, and reduce overall <PRTPAGE P="281"/>costs. Restructuring activities do not include routine or ongoing repositionings and redeployments of a contractor's productive facilities or workforce (e.g., normal plant rearrangement or employee relocation), nor do they include other routine or ordinary activities charged as indirect costs that would otherwise have been incurred (e.g., planning and analysis, contract administration and oversight, or recurring financial and administrative support).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Restructuring costs</E> means the costs, including both direct and indirect, of restructuring activities. Restructuring costs that may be allowed include, but are not limited to, severance pay for employees, early retirement incentive payments for employees, employee retraining costs, relocation expense for retained employees, and relocation and rearrangement of plant and equipment. For purposes of this definition, if restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities allocated to DoD contracts are less than $2.5 million, the costs shall not be subject to the audit, review, and determination requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this subsection; instead, the normal rules for determining cost allowability in accordance with FAR part 31 shall apply.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Restructuring savings</E> means cost reductions, including both direct and indirect cost reductions, that result from restructuring activities. Reassignments of cost to future periods are not restructuring savings.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations on cost allowability.</E> Restructuring costs associated with external restructuring activities shall not be allowed unless—</P>
              <P>(1) Such costs are allowable in accordance with FAR part 31 and DFARS part 231;</P>
              <P>(2) An audit of projected restructuring costs and restructuring savings is performed;</P>
              <P>(3) The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) reviews the audit report and the projected costs and projected savings, and negotiates an advance agreement in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection; and</P>
              <P>(4)(i) The official designated in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this subsection determines in writing that the audited projected savings, on a present value basis, for DoD resulting from the restructuring will exceed either—</P>
              <P>(A) The costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one; or</P>
              <P>(B) The costs allowed, and the business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) If the amount of restructuring costs is expected to exceed $25 million over a 5-year period, the designated official is the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) or the Principal Deputy. This authority may not be delegated below the level of an Assistant Secretary of Defense.</P>
              <P>(B) For all other cases, the designated official is the Director of the Defense Contract Management Agency. The Director may not delegate this authority.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures and ACO responsibilities.</E> As soon as it is known that the contractor will incur restructuring costs for external restructuring activities, the cognizant ACO shall follow the procedures at PGI 231.205-70(d).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Information needed to obtain a determination.</E> (1) The novation agreement (if one is required).</P>
              <P>(2) The contractor's restructuring proposal.</P>
              <P>(3) The proposed advance agreement.</P>
              <P>(4) The audit report.</P>
              <P>(5) Any other pertinent information.</P>
              <P>(6) The cognizant ACO's recommendation for a determination. This recommendation must clearly indicate one of the following, consistent with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this subsection:</P>
              <P>(i) The audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one on a present value basis.</P>
              <P>(ii) The business combination will result in the preservation of a critical capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD, and the audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed on a present value basis.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Contracting officer responsibilities.</E> (1) The contracting officer, in consultation with the cognizant ACO, should consider including a repricing clause in noncompetitive fixed-price contracts <PRTPAGE P="282"/>that are negotiated during the period between—</P>
              <P>(i) The time a business combination is announced; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The time the contractor's forward pricing rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of restructuring.</P>
              <P>(2) The decision to use a repricing clause will depend upon the particular circumstances involved, including—</P>
              <P>(i) When the restructuring will take place;</P>
              <P>(ii) When restructuring savings will begin to be realized;</P>
              <P>(iii) The contract performance period;</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether the contracting parties are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of restructuring on the contract; and</P>
              <P>(v) The size of the potential dollar impact of restructuring on the contract.</P>
              <P>(3) If the contracting officer decides to use a repricing clause, the clause must provide for a downward-only price adjustment to ensure that DoD receives its appropriate share of restructuring net savings.</P>

              <P>(1) Pursuant to section 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160), no limitation may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work under DoD contracts. The 26 percent limitation imposed on administrative indirect costs by OMB Circular No. A-21 shall not be applied to DoD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993, to institutions of higher education because the same limitation is not applied to other organizations performing similar work.<PRTPAGE P="283"/>

              <P>(2) The cognizant administrative contracting officer may waive the prohibition in 231.303(1) if the governing body of the institution of higher education requests the waiver to simplify the institution's overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.</P>

            <P>(a) DoD policy is to make contract financing payments as quickly as possible. Generally, the contracting officer shall insert the standard due dates of 7 days for progress payments, and 14 days for performance-based payments and interim payments on cost-type contracts, in the appropriate paragraphs of the respective payment clauses. For interim payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for services, see 232.906(a)(i).</P>
            <P>(b) The contracting officer should coordinate contract financing payment terms with offices that will be involved in the payment process to ensure that specified terms can be met. Where justified, the contracting officer may insert a due date greater than, but not less than, the standard. In determining payment terms, consider—</P>
            <P>(i) Geographical separation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Workload;</P>
            <P>(iii) Contractor ability to submit a proper request; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Other factors that could affect timing of payment.</P>

            <P>(a) The Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) (OUSD(AT&amp;L)DPAP) is responsible for ensuring uniform administration of DoD contract financing, including DoD <PRTPAGE P="285"/>contract financing policies and important related procedures. Agency discretion under FAR part 32 is at the DoD level and is not delegated to the departments and agencies. Proposals by the departments and agencies, to exercise agency discretion, shall be submitted to OUSD(AT&amp;L)DPAP.</P>
            <P>(b) Departments and agencies are responsible for their day-to-day contract financing operations. Refer specific cases involving financing policy or important procedural issues to OUSD(AT&amp;L)DPAP for consideration through the department/agency Contract Finance Committee members (also see Subpart 201.4 for deviation request and approval procedures).</P>

            <P>(a) Prior to award of a contract, when—</P>
            <P>(1) The contractor is on a list requiring preaward clearance or other special clearance before award;</P>
            <P>(2) The contractor is listed on the Consolidated List of Contractors Indebted to the Government (Hold-Up List), or is otherwise known to be indebted to the Government;</P>
            <P>(3) The contractor may receive Government assets such as contract financing payments or Government property;</P>
            <P>(4) The contractor is experiencing performance difficulties on other work; or</P>
            <P>(5) The contractor is a new company or a new supplier of the item.</P>

            <P>(a) The contracting officer shall obtain the type and depth of financial and other information that is required to establish a contractor's financial capability or disclose a contractor's financial condition. While the contracting officer should not request information that is not necessary for protection for the Government's interests, the contracting officer must insist upon obtaining the information that is necessary. The unwillingness or inability of a contractor to present reasonably requested information in a timely manner, especially information that a prudent business person would be expected to have and to use in the professional management of a business, may be a material fact in the determination of the contractor's responsibility and prospects for contract completion.</P>
            <P>(b) The contracting officer shall obtain the following information to the extent required to protect the Government's interest. In addition, if the contracting officer concludes that information not listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this subsection is required to comply with 232.072-1, that information should be requested. The information must be for the person(s) who are legally liable for contract performance. If the contractor is not a corporation, the contracting officer shall obtain the required information for each individual/joint venturer/partner:</P>
            <P>(1) Balance sheet and income statement—</P>
            <P>(i) For the current fiscal year (interim);<PRTPAGE P="286"/>
            </P>

            <P>(iii) Forecasted for each fiscal year for the remainder of the period of contract performance.</P>
            <P>(2) Summary history of the contractor and its principal managers, disclosing any previous insolvencies—corporate or personal, and describing its products or services.</P>

            <P>(i) Availability of cash to finance contract performance;</P>
            <P>(ii) Contractor's exposure to financial crisis from creditor's demands;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Cash flow forecasts.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A contractor must be able to sustain a sufficient cash flow to perform the contract. When there is doubt regarding the sufficiency of a contractor's cash flow, the contracting officer should require the contractor to submit a cash flow forecast covering the duration of the contract.</P>
            <P>(b) A contractor's inability of refusal to prepare and provide cash flow forecasts or to reconcile actual cash flow with previous forecasts is a strong indicator of serious managerial deficiencies or potential contract cost or performance problems.</P>

            <P>(c) Single or one-time cash flow forecasts are of limited forecasting power. As such, they should be limited to preaward survey situations. Reliability of cash flow forecasts can be established only by comparing a series of previous actual cash flows with the <PRTPAGE P="287"/>corresponding forecasts and examining the causes of any differences.</P>
            <P>(d) Cash flow forecasts must—</P>
            <P>(1) Show the origin and use of all material amounts of cash within the entire business unit responsible for contract performance, period by period, for the length of the contract (or until the risk of a cash crisis ends); and</P>
            <P>(2) Provide an audit trail to the data and assumptions used to prepare it.</P>
            <P>(e) Cash flow forecasts can be no more reliable than the assumptions on which they are based. Most important of these assumptions are—</P>
            <P>(1) Estimated amounts and timing of purchases and payments for materials, parts, components, subassemblies, and services;</P>
            <P>(2) Estimated amounts and timing of payments of purchase or production of capital assets, test facilities, and tooling;</P>
            <P>(3) Amounts and timing of fixed cash charges such as debt installments, interest, rentals, taxes, and indirect costs;</P>
            <P>(4) Estimated amounts and timing of payments for projected labor, both direct and indirect;</P>
            <P>(5) Reasonableness of projected manufacturing and production schedules;</P>
            <P>(6) Estimated amounts and timing of billings to customers (including progress payments), and customer payments;</P>
            <P>(7) Estimated amounts and timing of cash receipts from lenders or other credit sources, and liquidation of loans; and</P>
            <P>(8) Estimated amount and timing of cash receipt from other sources.</P>
            <P>(f) The contracting officer should review the assumptions underlying the cash flow forecasts. In determining whether the assumptions are reasonable and realistic, the contracting officer should consult with—</P>
            <P>(1) The contractor;</P>
            <P>(2) Government personnel in the areas of finance, engineering, production, cost, and price analysis; or</P>
            <P>(3) Prospective supply, subcontract, and loan or credit sources.</P>

This determination was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on June 11, 1996, as required by law.

              <P>(2) Criteria limiting normal business operations during emergencies and contingency operations that restrict the use of FAR 32.9 may include such conditions as—</P>
              <P>(i) Support infrastructure, hardware, communications capabilities, and bandwidth are not consistently available such that normal business operations can be carried out;</P>
              <P>(ii) Support resources, facilities, and banking needs are not consistently available for use as necessary in carrying out normal business operations;</P>

Government payment of construction progress payments can, in most cases, be made within the 14-day period allowed by the Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts clause. While the contracting officer may specify a longer period because the period specified in the contract is not <PRTPAGE P="294"/>reasonable or practical, such change should be coordinated with the Government offices responsible for acceptance or approval and for payment. Reasons for specifying a longer period include but are not limited to: the nature of the work or supplies or services, inspection or testing requirements, shipping and acceptance terms, and resources available at the acceptance activity. A constructive acceptance period of less than the cited 7 or 14 days is not authorized.</P>

              <P>(a) As with all contract financing, the purpose of performance-based payments is to assist the contractor in the payment of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. Therefore, performance-based payments should never exceed total cost incurred at any point during the contract. See PGI 232.1001(a) for additional information on use of performance-based payments.</P>
              <P>(d) The contracting officer shall use the following standard payment terms for performance-based payments: The contractor entitlement date, if any, specified in the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.</P>

              <P>(b) Prior to using performance-based payments, the contracting officer shall—<PRTPAGE P="295"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Agree with the offeror on price using customary progress payments before negotiation begins on the use of performance-based payments, except for modifications to contracts that already use performance-based payments;</P>

              <P>(ii) Analyze the performance-based payment schedule using the performance-based payments (PBP) analysis tool. The PBP analysis tool is on the DPAP Web site in the Cost, Pricing &amp; Finance section, Performance Based Payments—Guide Book &amp; Analysis Tool tab, at <E T="03">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/Performance_based_payments.html.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(A) When considering performance-based payments, obtain from the offeror/contractor a proposed performance-based payments schedule that includes all performance-based payments events, completion criteria and event values along with the projected expenditure profile in order to negotiate the value of the performance events. If performance-based payments are deemed practical, the Government will evaluate and negotiate the details of the performance-based payments schedule.</P>
              <P>(B) For modifications to contracts that already use performance-based payments financing, the basis for negotiation must include performance-based payments. The PBP analysis tool will be used in the same manner to help determine the price for the modification. The only difference is that the baseline assuming customary progress payments will reflect an objective profit rate instead of a negotiated profit rate;</P>
              <P>(iii) Negotiate the consideration to be received by the Government if the performance-based payments payment schedule will be more favorable to the contractor than customary progress payments;</P>
              <P>(iv) Obtain the approval of the business clearance approving official, or one level above the contracting officer, whichever is higher, for the negotiated consideration; and</P>
              <P>(v) Document in the contract file that the performance-based payment schedule provides a mutually beneficial settlement position that reflects adequate consideration to the Government for the improved contractor cash flow.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Instructions for multiple appropriations.</E> If the contract contains foreign military sales requirements, the contracting officer shall provide instructions for distribution of the contract financing payments to each country's account.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this subsection—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Research facility</E> means—</P>
            <P>(i) Real property, other than land; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Includes structures, alterations, and improvements, acquired for the purpose of conducting scientific research under contracts with departments and agencies of the DoD.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Special use allowance</E> means a negotiated direct or indirect allowance—</P>
            <P>(i) For construction or acquisition of buildings, structures, and real property, other than land; and</P>

            <P>(ii) Where the allowance is computed at an annual rate exceeding the rate which normally would be allowed under FAR subpart 31.3.<PRTPAGE P="307"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> (1) Educational institutions are to furnish the facilities necessary to perform Defense contracts. FAR 31.3 governs how much the Government will reimburse the institution for the research programs. However, in extraordinary situations, the Government may give special use allowances to an educational institution when the institution is unable to provide the capital for new laboratories or expanded facilities needed for Defense contracts.</P>
            <P>(2) Decisions to provide a special use allowance must be made on a case-by-case basis, using the criteria in paragraph (c) of this subsection.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Authorization for special use allowance.</E> The head of a contracting activity may approve special use allowances only when all of the following conditions are met—</P>
            <P>(1) The research facility is essential to the performance of DoD contracts;</P>
            <P>(2) Existing facilities, either Government or nongovernment, cannot meet program requirements practically or effectively;</P>
            <P>(3) The proposed agreement for special use allowances is a sound business arrangement;</P>
            <P>(4) The Government's furnishing of Government-owned facilities is undesirable or impractical; and</P>
            <P>(5) The proposed use of the research facility is to conduct essential Government research which requires the new or expanded facilities.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of the special use allowance.</E> (1) In negotiating a special use allowance—</P>
            <P>(i) Compare the needs of DoD and of the institution for the research facility to determine the amount of the special use allowance;</P>
            <P>(ii) Consider rental costs for similar space in the area where the research facility is or will be located to establish the annual special use allowance;</P>
            <P>(iii) Do not include or allow—</P>
            <P>(A) The costs of land; or</P>
            <P>(B) Interest charges on capital;</P>
            <P>(iv) Do not include maintenance, utilities, or other operational costs;</P>
            <P>(v) The period of allowance generally will be—</P>
            <P>(A) At least ten years; or</P>
            <P>(B) A shorter period if the total amount to be allowed is less than the construction or acquisition cost for the research facility;</P>
            <P>(vi) Generally, provide for allocation of the special use allowance equitably among the Government contracts using the research facility;</P>
            <P>(vii) Special use allowances apply only in the years in which the Government has contracts in effect with the institution. However, if in any given year there is a reduced level of Government research effort which results in the special use allowance being excessive compared to the Government research funding, a separate special use allowance may be negotiated for that year;</P>
            <P>(viii) Special use allowances may be adjusted for the period before construction is complete if the facility is partially occupied and used for Government research during that period.</P>
            <P>(2) A special use allowance may be based on either total or partial cost of construction or acquisition of the research facility.</P>
            <P>(i) When based on total cost neither the normal use allowance nor depreciation will apply—</P>
            <P>(A) During the special use allowance period; and</P>
            <P>(B) After the educational institution has recovered the total construction or acquisition cost from the Government or other users.</P>
            <P>(ii) When based on partial cost, normal use allowance and depreciation—</P>
            <P>(A) Apply to the balance of costs during the special use allowance period to the extent negotiated in the special use allowance agreement; and</P>
            <P>(B) Do not apply after the special use allowance period, except for normal use allowance applied to the balance.</P>
            <P>(3) During the special use allowance period, the research facility—</P>
            <P>(i) Shall be available for Government research use on a priority basis over nongovernment use; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Cannot be put to any significant use other than that which justified the special use allowance, unless the head of the contracting activity, who approved the special use allowance, consents.</P>

            <P>(4) The Government will pay only an allocable share of the special use allowance when the institution makes any substantial use of the research facility <PRTPAGE P="308"/>for parties other than the Government during the period when the special use allowance is in effect.</P>
            <P>(5) In no event shall the institution be paid more than the acquisition costs.</P>

              <P>(c) Special construction costs may be—</P>

              <P>(1) A contingent liability for using telecommunications services for a shorter time than the minimum to reimburse the contractor for unamortized nonrecoverable costs. These costs are usually expressed in <PRTPAGE P="339"/>terms of a termination liability, as provided in the contract or by tariff;</P>
              <P>(2) A onetime special construction charge;</P>
              <P>(3) Recurring charges for constructed facilities;</P>

              <P>(2) Disclose excessive or duplicative construction; and</P>
              <P>(3) When different forms of charge are possible, provide for the form of charge most advantageous to the Government.</P>
              <P>(e) When possible, analyze and approve special construction charges before receiving the service. Impose a ceiling on the special construction costs before authorizing the contractor to proceed, if prior approval is not possible. The contracting officer must approve special construction charges before final payment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Connection and service charges.</E> The Government may pay a connection charge when required to cover the cost of the necessary connecting facilities. A connection charge based on the estimated labor cost of installing and removing the facility shall not include salvage cost. A lump-sum connection charge shall be no more than the agreed cost of the connecting facilities less net salvage. The order of precedence for contractual treatment of connection and service charges is—</P>
              <P>(i) No connection charge.</P>
              <P>(ii) Termination liability. Use when an obligation is necessary to secure the required services. The obligation must be not more than the agreed connection charge, less any net salvage material costs. Use of a termination liability instead of a connection charge requires the approval of the service power procurement officer or designee.</P>
              <P>(iii) Connection charge, refundable. Use a refundable connection charge when the supplier refuses to provide the facilities based on lack of capital or published rules which prohibit providing up-front funding. The contract should provide for refund of the connection charge within five years unless a longer period or omission of the refund requirement is authorized by the service power procurement officer or designee.</P>
              <P>(iv) Connection and service charges, nonrefundable. The Government may pay certain nonrefundable, nonrecurring charges including service initiation charges, a contribution in aid of construction, membership fees, and charges required by the supplier's rules and regulations to be paid by the customer. If possible, consider sharing with other than Government users the use of (and costs for) facilities when large nonrefundable charges are required.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Construction and labor requirements.</E> Follow the procedures at PGI 241.202(2) for construction and labor requirements associated with connection and service charges.</P>

                <P>“(7)(i) Except as set forth in subparagraph (7)(ii) below, the Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related increases, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from the transfer or this Agreement, other than those that the Government in the absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been obligated to pay or reimburse under the terms of the contracts.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Government recognizes that restructuring by the Transferee incidental to the acquisition/merger may be in the best interests of the Government. Restructuring costs that are allowable under Part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or Part 231 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) may be reimbursed under flexibily-priced novated contracts, provided the Transferee demonstrates that the restructuring will reduce overall costs to the Department of Defense (DoD) (and to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), where there is a mix of DoD and NASA contracts), and the requirements included in DFARS 231.205-70 are met. Restructuring costs shall not be allowed on novated contracts unless there is an audit of the restructuring proposal; a determination by the contracting officer of overall reduced costs to DoD/NASA; and an Advance Agreement setting forth a cumulative cost ceiling for restructuring projects and the period to which such costs shall be assigned.”</P>

              <P>(1) In accordance with agency procedures, identify one or more covered contracts containing the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, from which payments will be withheld. When identifying the covered contracts from which to withhold payments, the contracting officer shall ensure that the total amount of payment withholding under 252.242-7005, does not exceed 10 percent of progress payments, performance-based payments, and interim payments under cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contracts billed under each of the identified covered contracts.

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Correction of significant deficiencies.</E> (1) If the contractor notifies the contracting officer that the contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the contracting officer shall request the auditor or functional specialist to review the correction to verify that the deficiencies have been corrected. If, after receipt of verification, the contracting officer determines that the contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the contracting officer's final determination, the contracting officer shall discontinue the withholding of payments, release any payments previously withheld, and approve the system, unless other significant deficiencies remain.</P>
              <P>(2) Prior to the receipt of verification, the contracting officer may discontinue withholding payments pending receipt of verification, and release any payments previously withheld, if the contractor submits evidence that the significant deficiencies have been corrected, and the contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, determines that there is a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented and are expected to correct the significant deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(3) Within 90 days of receipt of the contractor notification that the contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the contracting officer shall—</P>

              <P>(ii) Reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies covered under the corrective action plan by at least 50 percent of the amount being withheld from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the contractor, in writing, to reduce the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers by at least 50 percent, until the contracting officer makes a determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If, at any time, the contracting officer determines that the contractor has failed to correct the significant deficiencies identified in the contractor's notification, the contracting officer will continue, reinstate, or increase withholding from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the contractor, in writing, to continue, reinstate, or increase the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to the percentage initially withheld, until the contracting officer determines that the contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the contracting officer's final determination.</P>

              <P>(a) The administrative contracting officer (ACO) is responsible for determining the allowability of insurance/pension costs in Government contracts and for determining the need for a Contractor/Insurance Pension Review (CIPR). Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) insurance/pension specialists and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) auditors assist ACOs in making these determinations, conduct CIPRs when needed, and perform other routine audits as authorized under FAR 42.705 and 52.215-2.

              <P>(2) Qualifying sales are sales for which certified cost or pricing data were required under 10 U.S.C. 2306a, as implemented in FAR 15.403, or that are contracts priced on other than a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis. Sales include prime contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to such contracts and subcontracts.</P>

              <P>(1) Information or data reveals a deficiency in the contractor's insurance/pension program.</P>
              <P>(2) The contractor proposes or implements changes in its insurance, pension, or deferred compensation plans.</P>
              <P>(3) The contractor is involved in a merger, acquisition, or divestiture.</P>
              <P>(4) The Government needs to follow up on contractor implementation of prior CIPR recommendations.</P>
              <P>(c) The DCAA auditor shall use relevant findings and recommendations of previously performed CIPRs in determining the scope of any audits of insurance and pension costs.</P>
              <P>(d) When a Government organization believes that a review of the contractor's insurance/pension program should be performed, that organization should provide a recommendation for a review to the ACO. If the ACO concurs, the review should be performed as part of an ACO-initiated special CIPR or as part of a CIPR already scheduled for the near future.</P>

              <P>(1) The contract term is 2 years or more;</P>
              <P>(2) The contract is estimated to require—</P>
              <P>(i) Total RDT&amp;E financing in excess of $25 million; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Total production investment in excess of $100 million; and</P>

              <P>(c) The contractor and the contracting officer must agree upon an amount that represents their best estimate of the total special termination costs to which the contractor would be entitled in the event of termination of the contract. Insert this amount in paragraph (c) of the clause.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Consider substituting an alternate paragraph (c) for paragraph (c) of the basic clause when—</P>
              <P>(i) The contract covers an unusually long performance period; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The contractor's cost risk associated with contingent special termination costs is expected to fluctuate extensively over the period of the contract.</P>
              <P>(2) The alternate paragraph (c) should provide for periodic negotiation and adjustment of the amount reserved for special termination costs. Occasions for periodic adjustment may include—</P>

              <P>(b) Contracting officers shall ensure that the Canadian Commercial Corporation submits termination settlement proposals in the format prescribed in FAR 49.602 and that they contain the amount of settlements with subcontractors.

              <P>(1) That disposition of inventory has been completed; and</P>
              <P>(2) That the Contract Claims Resolution Board of the Public Works and Government Services Canada has approved settlements with Canadian subcontractors when the Procedures Manual on Termination of Contracts requires such approval.</P>

              <P>(ii) A contract modification increasing the contract price and obligating the additional funds.</P>
              <P>(d) The Canadian Commercial Corporation should send all termination settlement proposals submitted by U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to the TCO of the cognizant contract administration office of the Defense Contract Management Agency for settlement.

The Canadian Commercial Corporation is responsible for execution of the settlement agreement with these subcontractors.</P>
              <P>(e) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will continue administering contracts that the U.S. contracting officer terminates.</P>
              <P>(f) The Canadian Commercial Corporation will settle all Canadian subcontracts in accordance with the policies, practices, and procedures of the Canadian Government.</P>

                  <P>(2) As soon as practicable after agreement on price, but before contract award (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts), the Offeror shall submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2.</P>

                  <P>(3) The Offeror is responsible for determining whether a subcontractor qualifies for an exception from the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data on the basis of adequate price competition, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> two or more responsible offerors, competing independently, submit priced offers that satisfy the Government's expressed requirement in accordance with FAR 15.403-1(c)(1)(i).</P>

                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Offset</E> means a benefit or obligation agreed to by a contractor and a foreign government or international organization as an inducement or condition to purchase supplies or services pursuant to a foreign military sale (FMS). There are two types of offsets: Direct offsets and indirect offsets.</P>
                  <P>(i) A direct offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are directly related to the item being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.</P>

                  <P>(ii) An indirect offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are not directly related to the specific item(s) being purchased and are not integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road or other facility. Indirect offsets would also include projects that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a project to develop or advance a capability, technology transfer, or know-how in a foreign company). Indirect offsets may be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.</P>

                  <P>(2) The Government shall pay for those items at the contract unit price increased to the extent provided by paragraph (d) of this clause.</P>

The extent of and criteria for such testing shall be determined by the Contractor based on considerations that include the nature of the work being performed under the contract, the employee's duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and the risks to health, safety, or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this clause—</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Combatant Commander</E> means the commander of a unified or specified combatant command established in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 161.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Contractors authorized to accompany the Force,</E> or <E T="03">CAAF,</E> means contractor personnel, including all tiers of subcontractor personnel, who are authorized to accompany U.S. Armed Forces in applicable operations and have been afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. CAAF generally include all U.S. citizen and third-country national employees not normally residing within the operational area whose area of performance is in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces and who routinely are collocated with the U.S. Armed Forces (especially in non-permissive environments). Personnel collocated with U.S. Armed Forces shall be <PRTPAGE P="510"/>afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. In some cases, Combatant Commander subordinate commanders may designate mission-essential host nation or local national contractor employees (e.g., interpreters) as CAAF. CAAF includes contractors previously identified as contractors deploying with the U.S. Armed Forces. CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Designated operational area</E> means a geographic area designated by the combatant commander or subordinate joint force commander for the conduct or support of specified military operations.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Designated reception site</E> means the designated place for the reception, staging, integration, and onward movement of contractors deploying during a contingency. The designated reception site includes assigned joint reception centers and other Service or private reception sites.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Law of war</E> means that part of international law that regulates the conduct of armed hostilities. The law of war encompasses all international law for the conduct of hostilities binding on the United States or its individual citizens, including treaties and international agreements to which the United States is a party, and applicable customary international law.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Non-CAAF</E> means personnel who are not designated as CAAF, such as local national (LN) employees and non-LN employees who are permanent residents in the operational area or third-country nationals not routinely residing with U.S. Armed Forces (and third-country national expatriates who are permanent residents in the operational area) who perform support functions away from the close proximity of, and do not reside with, U.S. Armed Forces. Government-furnished support to non-CAAF is typically limited to force protection, emergency medical care, and basic human needs (e.g., bottled water, latrine facilities, security, and food when necessary) when performing their jobs in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces. Non-CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.</P>
                  <P>
                    <E T="03">Subordinate joint force commander</E> means a sub-unified commander or joint task force commander.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) This clause applies to both CAAF and non-CAAF when performing in a designated operational area outside the United States to support U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States in—</P>
                  <P>(i) Contingency operations;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Peace operations, consistent with Joint Publication 3-07.3; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) Other military operations or military exercises, when designated by the Combatant Commander or as directed by the Secretary of Defense.</P>
                  <P>(2) Contract performance in support of U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States may require work in dangerous or austere conditions. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor accepts the risks associated with required contract performance in such operations.</P>
                  <P>(3) When authorized in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause to carry arms for personal protection, Contractor personnel are only authorized to use force for individual self-defense.</P>
                  <P>(4) Unless immune from host nation jurisdiction by virtue of an international agreement or international law, inappropriate use of force by contractor personnel supporting the U.S. Armed Forces can subject such personnel to United States or host nation prosecution and civil liability (see paragraphs (d) and (j)(3) of this clause).</P>
                  <P>(5) Service performed by Contractor personnel subject to this clause is not active duty or service under 38 U.S.C. 106 note.</P>

                  <P>(A) The Contractor cannot obtain effective security services;</P>
                  <P>(B) Effective security services are unavailable at a reasonable cost; or</P>
                  <P>(C) Threat conditions necessitate security through military means.</P>
                  <P>(ii) In appropriate cases, the Combatant Commander may provide security through military means, commensurate with the level of security provided DoD civilians.</P>
                  <P>(2)(i) Generally, CAAF will be afforded emergency medical and dental care if injured while supporting applicable operations. Additionally, non-CAAF employees who are injured while in the vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces will normally receive emergency medical and dental care. Emergency medical and dental care includes medical care situations in which life, limb, or eyesight is jeopardized. Examples of emergency medical and dental care include examination and initial treatment of victims of sexual assault; refills of prescriptions for life-dependent drugs; repair of broken bones, lacerations, infections; and traumatic injuries to the dentition. Hospitalization will be limited to stabilization and short-term medical treatment with an emphasis on return to duty or placement in the patient movement system.</P>

                  <P>(ii) When the Government provides medical treatment or transportation of Contractor personnel to a selected civilian facility, the Contractor shall ensure that the Government is reimbursed for any costs associated with such treatment or transportation.<PRTPAGE P="511"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(iii) Medical or dental care beyond this standard is not authorized.</P>
                  <P>(3) Contractor personnel must have a Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT)-generated letter of authorization signed by the Contracting Officer in order to process through a deployment center or to travel to, from, or within the designated operational area. The letter of authorization also will identify any additional authorizations, privileges, or Government support that Contractor personnel are entitled to under this contract. Contractor personnel who are issued a letter of authorization shall carry it with them at all times while deployed.</P>
                  <P>(4) Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, the Contractor is responsible for all other support required for its personnel engaged in the designated operational area under this contract.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Compliance with laws and regulations.</E> (1) The Contractor shall comply with, and shall ensure that its personnel supporting U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause are familiar with and comply with, all applicable—</P>
                  <P>(i) United States, host country, and third country national laws;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Provisions of the law of war, as well as any other applicable treaties and international agreements;</P>
                  <P>(iii) United States regulations, directives, instructions, policies, and procedures; and</P>
                  <P>(iv) Orders, directives, and instructions issued by the Combatant Commander, including those relating to force protection, security, health, safety, or relations and interaction with local nationals.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Contractor shall institute and implement an effective program to prevent violations of the law of war by its employees and subcontractors, including law of war training in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that CAAF and non-CAAF are aware—</P>
                  <P>(i) Of the DoD definition of “sexual assault” in DoDD Directive 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program;</P>
                  <P>(ii) That many of the offenses addressed by the definition are covered under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (see paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this clause). Other sexual misconduct may constitute offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Federal law, such as the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, or host nation laws;</P>
                  <P>(iii) That the offenses not covered by the Uniform Code of Military Justice may nevertheless have consequences to the contractor employees (see paragraph (h)(1) of this clause).</P>
                  <P>(4) The Contractor shall report to the appropriate investigative authorities, identified in paragraph (d)(6) of this clause, any alleged offenses under—</P>
                  <P>(i) The Uniform Code of Military Justice (chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code) (applicable to contractors serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field during a declared war or contingency operations); or</P>

                <P>As prescribed in 227.7103-6(a), use the following clause:</P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items (FEB 2014)</HD>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this clause—</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Computer data base</E> means a collection of data recorded in a form capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include computer software.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer program</E> means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Computer software</E> means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled. Computer software does not include computer data bases or computer software documentation.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Computer software documentation</E> means owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.</P>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">Covered Government support contractor</E> means a contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014)under a contract, the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), provided that the contractor—</P>
                  <P>(i) Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Receives access to technical data or computer software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.</P>
                  <P>(6) <E T="03">Detailed manufacturing or process data</E> means technical data that describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.</P>
                  <P>(7) <E T="03">Developed</E> means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, <PRTPAGE P="536"/>the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.</P>
                  <P>(8) <E T="03">Developed exclusively at private expense</E> means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.</P>
                  <P>(i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.</P>
                  <P>(9) <E T="03">Developed exclusively with government funds</E> means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.</P>
                  <P>(10) <E T="03">Developed with mixed funding</E> means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.</P>
                  <P>(11) <E T="03">Form, fit, and function data</E> means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.</P>
                  <P>(12) <E T="03">Government purpose</E> means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.</P>
                  <P>(13) <E T="03">Government purpose rights</E> means the rights to—</P>
                  <P>(i) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data within the Government without restriction; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Release or disclose technical data outside the Government and authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for United States government purposes.</P>
                  <P>(14) <E T="03">Limited rights</E> means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—</P>
                  <P>(i) The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—</P>
                  <P>(A) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</P>
                  <P>(B) A release or disclosure to—</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contract for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A foreign government, of technical data other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use of such data by the foreign government is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The recipient of the technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and</P>
                  <P>(iii) The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.</P>
                  <P>(15) <E T="03">Technical data</E> means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation). The term does not include computer software or data incidental to contract administration, such as financial and/or management information.</P>
                  <P>(16) <E T="03">Unlimited rights</E> means rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose technical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Rights in technical data.</E> The Contractor grants or shall obtain for the Government the following royalty free, world-wide, nonexclusive, irrevocable license rights in technical data other than computer software documentation (see the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial <PRTPAGE P="537"/>Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract for rights in computer software documentation):</P>
                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Unlimited rights.</E> The Government shall have unlimited rights in technical data that are—</P>
                  <P>(i) Data pertaining to an item, component, or process which has been or will be developed exclusively with Government funds;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced for this contract, when the study, analysis, test, or similar work was specified as an element of performance;</P>
                  <P>(iii) Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;</P>

                  <P>(v) Necessary for installation, operation, maintenance, or training purposes (other than detailed manufacturing or process data);</P>
                  <P>(vi) Corrections or changes to technical data furnished to the Contractor by the Government;</P>
                  <P>(vii) Otherwise publicly available or have been released or disclosed by the Contractor or subcontractor without restrictions on further use, release or disclosure, other than a release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party;</P>
                  <P>(viii) Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or</P>
                  <P>(ix) Data furnished to the Government, under this or any other Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—</P>

                  <P>(B) Government purpose rights and the Contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Government purpose rights.</E> (i) The Government shall have government purpose rights for a five-year period, or such other period as may be negotiated, in technical data—</P>

                  <P>(B) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The five-year period, or such other period as may have been negotiated, shall commence upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the items, components, or processes or creation of the data described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this clause. Upon expiration of the five-year or other negotiated period, the Government shall have unlimited rights in the technical data.</P>
                  <P>(iii) The Government shall not release or disclose technical data in which it has government purpose rights unless—</P>
                  <P>(A) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); or</P>

                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Limited rights.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iv) through (b)(1)(ix) of this clause, the Government shall have limited rights in technical data—</P>
                  <P>(A) Pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense and marked with the limited rights legend prescribed in paragraph (f) of this clause; or</P>
                  <P>(B) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes.</P>

                  <P>(iii) The Contractor, its subcontractors, and suppliers are not required to provide the Government additional rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data furnished to the Government with limited rights. However, if the Government desires to obtain additional rights in technical data in which it has limited rights, the Contractor agrees to promptly enter into negotiations with the Contracting Officer to determine whether there are acceptable terms for transferring such <PRTPAGE P="538"/>rights.

                  <P>(C) The Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions as identified in the limited rights legend) may require each such covered Government support contractor to enter into a non-disclosure agreement directly with the Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions) regarding the covered Government support contractor's use of such data, or alternatively, that the Contractor (or party asserting restrictions) may waive in writing the requirement for a non-disclosure agreement; and</P>
                  <P>(D) Any such non-disclosure agreement shall address the restrictions on the covered Government support contractor's use of the limited rights data as set forth in the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.

                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Contractor rights in technical data.</E> All rights not granted to the Government are retained by the Contractor.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Third party copyrighted data.</E> The Contractor shall not, without the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any copyrighted data in the technical data to be delivered under this contract unless the Contractor is the copyright owner or has obtained for the Government the license rights necessary to perfect a license or licenses in the deliverable data of the appropriate scope set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause, and has affixed a statement of the license or licenses obtained on behalf of the Government and other persons to the data transmittal document.</P>

                  <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, technical data that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure are identified in an attachment to this contract (the Attachment). The Contractor shall not deliver any data with restrictive markings unless the data are listed on the Attachment.</P>
                  <P>(3) In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other assertions may be identified after award when based on new information or inadvertent omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have materially affected the source selection decision. Such identification and assertion shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer as soon as practicable prior to the scheduled date for delivery of the data, in the following format, and signed by an official authorized to contractually obligate the Contractor: Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical Data.</P>

                  <P>(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will be delivered.</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.</E> (1) The Contractor shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.</P>
                  <P>(2) Whenever any technical data for noncommercial items, or for commercial items developed in any part at Government expense, is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, including subcontracts or other contractual instruments for commercial items, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. This clause will govern the technical data pertaining to noncommercial items or to any portion of a commercial item that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher-tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data.</P>

                  <P>(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the <PRTPAGE P="541"/>prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.</P>
                  <P>(4) The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.</P>
                  <P>(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligations to the Government.</P>

Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Nonconforming markings.</E> A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (6)) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.</P>

                  <P>(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or computer software will be delivered.</P>

                  <P>(2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data—Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.</P>
                  <P>(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.</P>
                  <P>(4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.</P>
                  <P>(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) As used in this clause, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “Contractor” means the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers.</P>
                  <P>(2) Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Justification.</E> The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions on <PRTPAGE P="559"/>the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d) or a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers.</E> The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at any tier who assert restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software. Neither this clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Requests for information.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.</P>
                  <P>(2) Based upon the information provided, if the—</P>
                  <P>(i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the Contracting Officer may—</P>
                  <P>(A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or</P>
                  <P>(B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike the unjustified restrictions and return the corrected software to the Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software, the Contracting Officer may correct the strike the markings at the Contractor's expense.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify the Contractor in writing.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a Contracting Officer's request for information or failure to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions.</E> (1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government, or three years following final payment under this contract, whichever is later.</P>
                  <P>(2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation under this clause. Only a Contracting Officer's final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Challenge procedures.</E> (1) A challenge must be in writing and shall—</P>

                  <P>(ii) Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days;</P>
                  <P>(iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the assertion based upon records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available to the Contractor, in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and</P>
                  <P>(iv) State that a Contracting Officer's final decision, during the three-year period preceding this challenge, or action of a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the validity of an identical assertion made by the Contractor (or a licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response if the Contractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting documentation if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor's explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor agrees to promptly respond to the Contracting Officer's request for additional supporting documentation.</P>
                  <P>(4) Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any time prior to a Contracting Officer's final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.</P>

                  <P>(5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information or additional information under paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer <PRTPAGE P="560"/>shall issue a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.</P>
                  <P>(6) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing any available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has—</P>
                  <P>(i) Not been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) Been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, validating the asserted restriction.</P>
                  <P>(7) A Contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted restriction(s) from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer who initiated the first in time unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other Contracting Officers who have challenged the restrictions and the Contractor, shall formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the contractor a reasonable opportunity for responding to each challenge.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Contractor appeal—Government obligation.</E> (1) The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restriction—</P>
                  <P>(i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision to allow the Contractor to appeal to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an appropriate court;</P>
                  <P>(ii) For a period of one year from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90) days following the Contracting Officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided notice of an intent to file suit in an appropriate court; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has: (A) appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit an appropriate court within ninety (90) days; or (B) submitted, within ninety (90) days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed suit within one year.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor fails to—</P>
                  <P>(i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision;</P>
                  <P>(ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from such date; or</P>
                  <P>(iii) File suit within one year after the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided notice of intent to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision.</P>
                  <P>(3) The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling circumstances. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) government purpose legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do so; or (ii) restricted or special license rights for government purposes only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103-7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), or is a Government contractor receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends. The agency head's determination may be made at any time after the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision and shall not affect the Contractor's right to damages against the United States, or other relief provided by law, if its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Final disposition of appeal or suit.</E> If the Contractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is:</P>
                  <P>(1) Sustained—</P>
                  <P>(i) Any restrictive marking on such computer software shall be struck or corrected at the contractor's expense or ignored; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</P>
                  <P>(2) Not sustained—</P>
                  <P>(i) The Government shall be bound by the asserted restriction; and</P>

                  <P>(ii) If the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith, <PRTPAGE P="561"/>the Government shall be liable to the Contractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor in defending the restriction.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Flowdown.</E> The Contractor shall insert this clause in all contracts, purchase orders, and other similar instruments with its subcontractors or suppliers, at any tier, who will be furnishing computer software to the Government in the performance of this contract.

                  <HD SOURCE="HD1">Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data (SEP 2016)</HD>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items clause of this contract.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense</E>—(1) <E T="03">Commercial items.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will presume that the Contractor's or a subcontractor's asserted use or release restrictions with respect to a commercial item is justified on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense.</P>
                  <P>(ii) The Contracting Officer will not challenge such assertions unless the Contracting Officer has information that demonstrates that the commercial item was not developed exclusively at private expense.</P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Major weapon systems.</E> In the case of a challenge to a use or release restriction that is asserted with respect to data of the Contractor or a subcontractor for a major weapon system or a subsystem or component thereof on the basis that the major weapon system, subsystem, or component was developed exclusively at private expense—</P>
                  <P>(i) The presumption in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause applies to—</P>
                  <P>(A) A commercial subsystem or component of a major weapon system, if the major weapon system was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with DFARS subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(a));</P>
                  <P>(B) A component of a subsystem, if the subsystem was acquired as a commercial item in accordance with DFARS subpart 234.70 (10 U.S.C. 2379(b)); and</P>
                  <P>(C) Any other component, if the component is a commercially available off-the-shelf item or a commercially available off-the-shelf item with modifications of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace or minor modifications made to meet Federal Government requirements; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) In all other cases, the challenge to the use or release restriction will be sustained unless information provided by the Contractor or a subcontractor demonstrates that the item or process was developed exclusively at private expense.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Justification.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is responsible for maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity of its markings that impose restrictions on the Government and others to use, duplicate, or disclose technical data delivered or required to be delivered under the contract or subcontract. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Prechallenge request for information.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish a written explanation for any restriction asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States or others to use technical data. If, upon review of the explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer remains unable to ascertain the basis of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any restrictive marking on technical data delivered or to be delivered under the contract or subcontract (e.g., a statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation). The Contractor or subcontractor shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.</P>

                  <P>(2) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of a restrictive marking, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the marking and that <PRTPAGE P="567"/>continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures in paragraph (e) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(3) If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, and the Contracting Officer determines that continued adherence to the marking would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item, component, or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the validity of the marking as described in paragraph (e) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Challenge.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer determines that a challenge to the restrictive marking is warranted, the Contracting Officer shall send a written challenge notice to the Contractor or subcontractor asserting the restrictive markings. Such challenge shall—</P>
                  <P>(i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;</P>
                  <P>(ii) Require a response within sixty (60) days justifying and providing sufficient evidence as to the current validity of the asserted restriction;</P>
                  <P>(iii) State that a DoD Contracting Officer's final decision, issued pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking identical to the asserted restriction, within the three-year period preceding the challenge, shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction if the validated restriction was asserted by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and</P>
                  <P>(iv) State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (f) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be considered a claim within the meaning of the 41 U.S.C. 7101, Contract Disputes and shall be certified in the form prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless of dollar amount.</P>
                  <P>(4) A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, shall formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties. The schedule shall afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice. All parties will be bound by this schedule.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond.</E> Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and the Disputes clause of this contract pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction. This final decision shall be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2) of this clause. Following issuance of the final decision, the Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds.</E> (1) if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking. This final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.</P>
                  <P>(2)(i) If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the longer period that the Government will require. The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.</P>

                  <P>(ii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking of a period of ninety (90) days from <PRTPAGE P="568"/>the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.</P>
                  <P>(iii) The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause. The Government will no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</P>
                  <P>(iv) The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data. Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Final disposition of appeal or suit.</E> (1) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained—</P>
                  <P>(i) The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be cancelled, corrected or ignored; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</P>
                  <P>(2) If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is not sustained—</P>
                  <P>(i) The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive marking; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Duration of right to challenge.</E> The Government may review the validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor. During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the restriction. The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data—</P>
                  <P>(1) Is publicly available;</P>
                  <P>(2) Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or</P>
                  <P>(3) Has been otherwise made available without restriction. Only the Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes “validation” as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Decision not to challenge.</E> A decision by the Government, or a determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute “validation.”</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">Privity of contract.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this <PRTPAGE P="569"/>clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings. However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract between the Government and subcontractors.</P>
                  <P>(l) <E T="03">Flowdown.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in contractual instruments, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial items, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data.</P>

                  <P>(3) The Contractor shall—</P>

                  <P>(iii) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, provided that, if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain ownership in that country; and</P>

                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Contractor action to protect the Government's interest.</E> (1) The Contractor shall execute or have executed and promptly deliver to the agency all instruments necessary to—</P>
                  <P>(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions in which the Contractor elects to retain ownership; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Assign title to the agency when requested under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause and enable the Government to obtain patent protection for that subject invention in any country.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Contractor shall—</P>

The termination will be effective at 12:01 a.m. on the fifteenth day following the day the written notice is received by the Contractor.</P>
                  <P>(i) If the Contracting Officer later determines that the Contractor acted promptly to correct the cited conditions or that the time taken by the Contractor was not unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price for any additional costs incurred as a result of termination of the Government's assumption of risk.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Any dispute as to the timeliness of the Contractor's action or the equitable adjustment shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.</P>

The Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any insurance costs extending from the end of the third working day after the Government's receipt of the Contractor's notice of correction until the Contractor is notified that the Government will resume the risk of loss.</P>
                  <P>(ii) If the Government does not again assume the risk of loss and the unreasonable conditions have been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for insurance costs, if any, extending after the third working day after the Government's receipt of the Contractor's notice of correction.</P>
                  <P>(6) The Government's termination of its assumption of risk of loss does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to comply with all other provisions of this clause, including the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations.”</P>

(This exclusion does not apply to Government-furnished property if damage consists of reasonable wear and tear or deterioration, or results from inherent vice, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> a known condition or design defect in the property); or</P>
                  <P>(6) Is sustained while the aircraft is being worked on and is a direct result of the work unless such damage, loss, or destruction would be covered by insurance which would have been maintained by the Contractor, but for the Government's assumption of risk.</P>

                  <P>(2) If the Government elects to require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition immediately prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price authorized by paragraph (j) of this clause shall not include the dollar amount of the risk assumed by the Contractor.</P>
                  <P>(3) In the event the Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees to credit the contract price or pay the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, the lesser of—</P>
                  <P>(i) $100,000;</P>

                  <P>(iii) The amount of the loss.</P>
                  <P>(4) For task order and delivery order contracts, the Contractor's share of the loss shall be the lesser of $100,000 or twenty percent of the combined total price or total estimated cost of those orders issued to date to which the clause applies.</P>
                  <P>(5) The costs incurred by the Contractor for its share of the loss and for insuring against that loss are unallowable costs, including but not limited to—</P>

In the absence of approval, the subcontract shall contain provisions requiring the return of aircraft in as good condition as when received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for the utilization of the property in accordance with the provisions of this contract.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Contractor's exclusion of insurance costs.</E> The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and will not include, except as may be authorized in this clause, any charge or contingency reserve for insurance covering damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in flight when the risk has been assumed by the Government, including the Contractor share of loss in this clause, even if the assumption may be terminated for aircraft in the open.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Procedures in the event of loss.</E> (1) In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor shall take all reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further damage, to separate damaged and undamaged aircraft, and to put all aircraft in the best possible order. Except in cases covered by paragraph (f)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a statement of—</P>
                  <P>(i) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;</P>

                  </P>
                  <P>(2) The Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing the obligations under this paragraph.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Loss prior to delivery.</E> (1) If prior to delivery and acceptance by the Government, aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government assumed the risk, the Government shall either—</P>
                  <P>(i) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to the condition immediately prior to the damage, in which event the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the contract price and the time for contract performance; or</P>
                  <P>(ii) Terminate this contract with respect to the aircraft. Notwithstanding the provisions in any other termination clause under this contract, in the event of termination, the Contractor shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft (or, if applicable, any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any amount the Contracting Officer determines—</P>
                  <P>(A) It would have cost the Contractor to complete the aircraft (or any work to be performed on the aircraft) together with anticipated profit on uncompleted work; and</P>
                  <P>(B) Would be the value of the damaged aircraft or any salvage retained by the Contractor.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Contracting Officer shall prescribe the manner of disposition of the damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft, or any parts of the aircraft. If any additional costs of such disposition are incurred by the Contractor, a further equitable adjustment will be made in the amount due the Contractor. Failure of the parties to agree upon termination costs or an equitable adjustment with respect to any aircraft shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.</P>
                  <P>(k) <E T="03">Reimbursement from a third party.</E> In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or compensated by a third party for damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft and has also been compensated by the Government, the Contractor shall equitably reimburse the Government. The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's right to recover against third parties for damage, loss, or destruction. Upon the request of the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the Contractor shall at Government expense furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment or subrogation) in obtaining recovery.</P>
                  <P>(l) <E T="03">Government acceptance of liability.</E> To the extent the Government has accepted such liability under other provisions of this contract, the Contractor shall not be reimbursed for liability to third persons for loss or damage to property or for death or bodily injury caused by aircraft during flight unless the flight crew members previously have been approved for this flight in writing by the Government Flight Representative, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation entitled “Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations”.</P>
                  <P>(m) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> The Contractor shall incorporate the requirements of this clause, including this paragraph (m), in all subcontracts.</P>

                  <P>(a) “Direct Contractor,” as used in this clause, means an individual, company, or entity with whom an agency of the United States Department of Defense has executed a written agreement that allows duty-free import of equipment, materials, and supplies into Spain for the construction, development, maintenance, and operation of Spanish-American installations and facilities.</P>

                  <P>(b) The Contractor is hereby designated as a Direct Contractor under the provisions of Complementary Agreement 5, articles 11, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the Agreement on Friendship, Defense and Cooperation between the United States Government and the Kingdom of Spain, dated July 2, 1982. The Agreement relates to contacts to be performed in whole or part in Spain, the provisions of which are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this contract by reference.<PRTPAGE P="581"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(c) The Contractor shall apply to the appropriate Spanish authorities for approval of status as a Direct Contractor in order to complete duty-free import of non-Spanish equipment, materials, and supplies represented as necessary for contract performance by the Contracting Officer. Orders for equipment, materials, and supplies placed prior to official notification of such approval shall be at the Contractor's own risk. The Contractor must submit its documentation in sufficient time to permit processing by the appropriate United States and Spanish Government agencies prior to the arrival of the equipment, material, or supplies in Spain. Seasonal variations in processing times are common, and the Contractor should program its projects accordingly. Any delay or expense arising directly or indirectly from this process shall not excuse untimely performance (except as expressly allowed in other provisions of this contract), constitute a direct or constructive change, or otherwise provide a basis for additional compensation or adjustment of any kind.</P>
                  <P>(d) To ensure that all duty-free imports are properly accounted for, exported, or disposed of, in accordance with Spanish law, the Contractor shall obtain a written bank letter of guaranty payable to the Treasurer of the United States, or such other authority as may be designated by the Contracting Officer, in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of this clause, prior to effecting any duty-free imports for the performance of this contract.</P>
                  <P>(e) If the Contractor fails to obtain the required guaranty, the Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may withhold a portion of the contract payments in order to establish a fund in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of this clause. The fund shall be used for the payment of import taxes in the event that the Contractor fails to properly account for, export, or dispose of equipment, materials, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.</P>
                  <P>(f) The amount of the bank letter of guaranty or size of the fund required under paragraph (d) or (e) of this clause normally shall be 5 percent of the contract value. However, if the Contractor demonstrates to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the amount retained by the United States Government or guaranteed by the bank is excessive, the amount shall be reduced to an amount commensurate with contingent import tax and duty-free liability. This bank guaranty or fund shall not be released to the Contractor until the Spanish General Directorate of Customs verifies the accounting, export, or disposition of the equipment, material, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.</P>

                <EXTRACT>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD1">Limitation of Government's Obligation (APR 2014)</HD>
                  <P>(a) Contract line item(s) <E T="03">[Contracting Officer insert after negotiations]</E> is/are incrementally funded. For this/these item(s), the sum of $__ <E T="03">[Contracting Officer insert after negotiations]</E> of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.” As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those items(s).</P>
                  <P>(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”</P>
                  <P>(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.</P>
                  <P>(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled “Disputes.”</P>
                  <P>(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.</P>

                  <P>(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default.” The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) <PRTPAGE P="589"/>of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”</P>
                  <P>(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.</P>
                  <P>(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:</P>
                  <P>On execution of contract $__</P>

                  <P>(e) The Contractor shall submit notification of any proposed substantive changes to the EVMS procedures and the impact of those changes to the CFA. If this contract has a value of $50 million or more, unless a waiver is granted by the CFA, any EVMS changes proposed by the Contractor require approval of the CFA prior to implementation. The CFA will advise the Contractor of the acceptability of such changes as soon as practicable (generally within 30 calendar days) after receipt of the Contractor's notice of proposed changes. If the CFA waives the <PRTPAGE P="596"/>advance approval requirements, the Contractor shall disclose EVMS changes to the CFA at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of implementation.</P>
                  <P>(f) The Government will schedule integrated baseline reviews as early as practicable, and the review process will be conducted not later than 180 calendar days after—</P>
                  <P>(1) Contract award;</P>
                  <P>(2) The exercise of significant contract options; and</P>
                  <P>(3) The incorporation of major modifications.
                  </P>
                  <FP>During such reviews, the Government and the Contractor will jointly assess the Contractor's baseline to be used for performance measurement to ensure complete coverage of the statement of work, logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, and identification of inherent risks.</FP>
                  <P>(g) The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records and data requested by the Contracting Officer or duly authorized representative as necessary to permit Government surveillance to ensure that the EVMS complies, and continues to comply, with the performance criteria referenced in paragraph (b) of this clause.</P>
                  <P>(h) When indicated by contract performance, the Contractor shall submit a request for approval to initiate an over-target baseline or over-target schedule to the Contracting Officer. The request shall include a top-level projection of cost and/or schedule growth, a determination of whether or not performance variances will be retained, and a schedule of implementation for the rebaselining. The Government will acknowledge receipt of the request in a timely manner (generally within 30 calendar days).</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Significant deficiencies.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer will provide an initial determination to the Contractor, in writing, on any significant deficiencies. The initial determination will describe the deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the Contractor to understand the deficiency.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Contractor shall respond within 30 days to a written initial determination from the Contracting Officer that identifies significant deficiencies in the Contractor's EVMS. If the Contractor disagrees with the initial determination, the Contractor shall state, in writing, its rationale for disagreeing.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Contracting Officer will evaluate the Contractor's response and notify the Contractor, in writing, of the Contracting Officer's final determination concerning—</P>
                  <P>(i) Remaining significant deficiencies;</P>
                  <P>(ii) The adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action;</P>
                  <P>(iii) System noncompliance, when the Contractor's existing EVMS fails to comply with the earned value management system guidelines in the ANSI/EIA-748; and</P>
                  <P>(iv) System disapproval, if initial EVMS validation is not successfully completed within the timeframe approved by the Contracting Officer, or if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor's earned value management system contains one or more significant deficiencies in high-risk guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 standards (guidelines 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, or 32). When the Contracting Officer determines that the existing earned value management system contains one or more significant deficiencies in one or more of the remaining 16 guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 standards, the contracting officer will use discretion to disapprove the system based on input received from functional specialists and the auditor.</P>
                  <P>(4) If the Contractor receives the Contracting Officer's final determination of significant deficiencies, the Contractor shall, within 45 days of receipt of the final determination, either correct the significant deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the significant deficiencies.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Withholding payments.</E> If the Contracting Officer makes a final determination to disapprove the Contractor's EVMS, and the contract includes the clause at 252.242-7005, Contractor Business Systems, the Contracting Officer will withhold payments in accordance with that clause.</P>
                  <P>(k) With the exception of paragraphs (i) and (j) of this clause, the Contractor shall require its subcontractors to comply with EVMS requirements as follows:</P>
                  <P>(1) For subcontracts valued at $50 million or more, the following subcontractors shall comply with the requirements of this clause:</P>

For example, this could include the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable living human subjects as well as graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable living human subjects.</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Institution</E> means any public or private entity or agency (32 CFR 219.102(b)).</P>

The determination shall include citation of the exemption category under 32 CFR 219.101(b) and a rationale statement. In the event of a disagreement regarding the Contractor's furnished exemption determination, the HRPO retains final judgment on what research activities or classes of research are covered or are exempt under the contract.</P>
                  <P>(d) DoD staff, consultants, and advisory groups may independently review and inspect the Contractor's research and research procedures involving human subjects and, based on such findings, DoD may prohibit research that presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with DoD procedures.</P>

                  <P>(1) <E T="03">Landing areas</E> means—</P>
                  <P>(i) The primary surfaces, comprising the surface of the runway, runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones. The length of each primary surface is the same as the runway length. The width of each primary surface is 2,000 feet (1,000 feet on each side of the runway centerline);</P>
                  <P>(ii) The <E T="03">clear zone</E> beyond the ends of each runway, i.e., the extension of the primary surface for a distance of 1,000 feet beyond each end of each runway;</P>
                  <P>(iii) All taxiways, plus the lateral clearance zones along each side for the length of the taxiways (the outer edge of each lateral clearance zone is laterally 250 feet from the far or opposite edge of the taxiway, e.g., a 75-foot-wide taxiway would have a combined width of taxiway and lateral clearance zones of 425 feet); and</P>

                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Safety precaution areas</E> means those portions of approach-departure clearance zones and transitional zones where placement of objects incident to contract performance might result in vertical projections at or above the approach-departure clearance, or the transitional surface.</P>
                  <P>(i) The <E T="03">approach-departure clearance surface</E> is an extension of the primary surface and the clear zone at each end of each runway, for a distance of 50,000 feet, first along an inclined (glide angle) and then along a horizontal plane, both flaring symmetrically about the runway centerline extended.</P>
                  <P>(A) The inclined plane (glide angle) begins in the clear zone 200 feet past the end of the runway (and primary surface) at the same elevation as the end of the runway. It continues upward at a slope of 50:1 (1 foot vertically for each 50 feet horizontally) to an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. At that point the plane becomes horizontal, continuing at that same uniform elevation to a point 50,000 feet longitudinally from the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) and ending there.</P>
                  <P>(B) The width of the surface at the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) is the same as the width of the clear zone. It then flares uniformly, reaching the maximum width of 16,000 feet at the end.</P>

                  <P>(B) The slope of the incline plane is 7:1 (1 foot vertically for each 7 feet horizontally). It continues to the point of intersection with the—</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Inner horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airfield elevation); or</P>
                  <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Outer horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 500 feet above the established airfield elevation), whichever is applicable.</P>
                  <P>(iv) The “transitional zone” is the ground area under the transitional surface. (It adjoins the primary surface, clear zone, and approach-departure clearance zone.)</P>

                  <P>(6) Not open a trench unless material is on hand and ready for placing in the trench. As soon as practicable after material has been placed and work approved, the Contractor shall backfill and compact trenches as required by the contract.

                  <P>(3) Obtain, at an airfield where flying is controlled, additional permission from the control tower operator every time before entering any landing area, unless the landing area is marked as hazardous in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this clause;</P>
                  <P>(4) Identify all vehicles it operates in landing areas by means of a flag on a staff attached to, and flying above, the vehicle.

                  <P>(b) If the Government cancels any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract, before the services are made available to the Government, or terminates any of these services after they are made available to the Government, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for the actual nonrecoverable costs the Contractor has reasonably incurred in providing facilities and equipment for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse. The Government will not <PRTPAGE P="618"/>reimburse the Contractor for any actual nonrecoverable costs incurred after notice of award, but prior to execution of the order.</P>
                  <P>(c) When feasible, the Contractor shall reuse cancelled or terminated facilities or equipment to minimize the charges to the Government.</P>
                  <P>(d) If at any time the Government requires that telecommunications facilities or equipment be relocated within the Contractor's service area, the Government will have the option of paying the costs of relocating the facilities or equipment in lieu of paying any termination or cancellation charge under this clause. The basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability applicable to the facilities or equipment in their former location shall continue to apply to the facilities and equipment in their new location. Monthly recurring charges shall continue to be paid during the period.</P>
                  <P>(e) When there is another requirement or foreseeable reuse in place of cancelled or terminated facilities or equipment, no charge shall apply and the basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability shall be appropriately reduced. When feasible, the Contractor shall promptly reuse discontinued channels or facilities, including equipment for which the Government is obligated to pay a minimum service charge.</P>
                  <P>(f) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract will be determined under applicable tariffs governing cancellation and termination charges which—</P>
                  <P>(1) Are filed by the Contractor with a governmental regulatory body, as defined in the Orders For Facilities and Services clause of this agreement/contract;</P>
                  <P>(2) Are in effect on the date of termination; and</P>
                  <P>(3) Provide specific cancellation or termination charges for the facilities and equipment involved or show how to determine the charges.</P>
                  <P>(g) The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract, which are not subject to a governmental regulatory body, will be determined under a mutually agreed schedule in the communication services authorization (CSA) or other contractual document.</P>
                  <P>(h) If no applicable tariffs are in effect on the date of cancellation or termination or set forth in the applicable CSA or other contractual document, the Government's liability will be determined under the following settlement procedures—</P>
                  <P>(1) The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, inventory schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the Contractor's possession, the cost of which is included in the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.</P>
                  <P>(2) The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or facilities when the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the Government has not exercised its option to take title under the Title to Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment clause of this agreement/contract. The Contractor shall apply any proceeds of the sale to reduce any payments by the Government to the Contractor under a cancellation or termination settlement.</P>
                  <P>(3) The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under established accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to the provision of telecommunication services for public use.</P>
                  <P>(4) The net salvage value shall be deducted from the Contractor's installed cost. In determining net salvage value, the Contractor shall consider the foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment by the Contractor. The Contractor shall make allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when necessary either for the sale of facilities or their reuse by the Contractor in another location.</P>
                  <P>(5) Upon termination of services, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for the nonrecoverable cost less such costs amortized to the date services are terminated and establish the liability period as mutually agreed to but not to exceed ten years. In the case of either a cancellation or a termination, the Government's presumed maximum liability will be capped by the unpaid non-recurring charges and the monthly recurring charges set out in the contract/agreement. The presumed maximum liability for monthly recurring charges shall be capped at monthly recurring charges for the minimum service period and any required notice period.</P>
                  <P>(6) When the basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability established by the CSA or other contractual document is based on estimated costs, the Contractor agrees to settle on the basis of actual cost at the time of cancellation or termination.</P>
                  <P>(7) The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the termination liability period of the services, should the Contractor make reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or nonsalvable in the settlement, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for the value of the equipment or facilities.</P>
                  <P>(8) The Contractor agrees to exclude—</P>

                  <P>(i) Any costs which are not included in determining cancellation and termination <PRTPAGE P="619"/>charges under the Contractor's standard practices or procedures; and</P>
                  <P>(ii) Charges not ordinarily made by the Contractor for similar facilities or equipment, furnished under similar circumstances.</P>
                  <P>(i) The Government may, under such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the cancelled or terminated portion of this agreement/contract. The Government may make these payments if the Contracting Officer determines that the total of the payments is within the amount the Contractor is entitled. If the total of the payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined to be due under this clause, the Contractor shall pay the excess to the Government upon demand.</P>
                  <P>(j) Failure to agree shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause.</P>

                  <P>(a) When placing orders under Federal Supply Schedules, Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedules, or Enterprise Software Agreements, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable schedule or agreement and authorization. Include in each order:</P>
                  <P>(1) A copy of the authorization (unless a copy was previously furnished to the Federal Supply Schedule, Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedule, or Enterprise Software Agreement contractor).</P>
                  <P>(2) The following statement: Any price reductions negotiated as part of an Enterprise Software Agreement issued under a Federal Supply Schedule contract shall control. In the event of any other inconsistencies between an Enterprise Software Agreement, established as a Federal Supply Schedule blanket purchase agreement, and the Federal Supply Schedule contract, the latter shall govern.</P>
                  <P>(3) The completed address(es) to which the Contractor's mail, freight, and billing documents are to be directed.</P>
                  <P>(b) When placing orders under nonmandatory schedule contracts and requirements contracts, issued by the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Information Resources Management, for automated data processing equipment, software and maintenance, communications equipment and supplies, and teleprocessing services, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable contract and the procedures in paragraph (a) of this clause.</P>

                  <P>(4) Pay invoices from Government supply sources promptly. For purchases made from DoD supply sources, this means within 30 days of the date of a proper invoice. The Contractor shall annotate each invoice with the date of receipt. For purposes of computing interest for late Contractor payments, the Government's invoice is deemed to be a demand for payment in accordance with the Interest clause of this contract. The Contractor's failure to pay may also result in the DoD supply source refusing to honor the requisition (see DFARS 251.102(f)) or in the Contracting Officer terminating the Contractor's authorization to use DoD supply sources. In the event the Contracting Officer decides to terminate the authorization due to the Contractor's failure to pay in a timely manner, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with prompt written notice of the intent to terminate the authorization and the basis for such action. The Contractor shall have 10 days after receipt of the Government's notice in which to provide additional information as to why the authorization should not be terminated. The termination shall not provide the Contractor with an excusable delay for failure to perform or complete the contract in accordance with the terms of the contract, and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for any increased costs.</P>
                  <P>(d) When placing orders for Government stock on a non-reimbursable basis, the Contractor shall—</P>
                  <P>(1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer's authorization; and</P>

                  <P>(e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor use of Government supply sources. The Contracting Officer will not grant authorizations for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Part 1—Charter</HD>
            <P>1. There is created the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals which is hereby designated as the authorized representative of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Air Force, in hearing, considering and determining appeals by contractors from decisions of contracting officers or their authorized representatives or other authorities on disputed questions. These appeals may be taken (a) pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. Sections 7101-7109), (b) pursuant to the provisions of contracts requiring the decision by the Secretary of Defense or by a Secretary of a Military Department or their duly authorized representative, or (c) pursuant to the provisions of any directive whereby the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of a Military Department or their authorized representative has granted a right of appeal not contained in the contract on any matter consistent with the contract appeals procedure. The Board may determine contract disputes for other departments and agencies by agreement as permitted by law. The Board shall operate under general policies established or approved by the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition and may perform other duties as directed not inconsistent with the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. The Board shall decide the matters before it independently.</P>
            <P>2. Membership of the Board shall consist of attorneys at law who have been qualified in the manner prescribed by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. Appointment of Board members shall be made by the Secretary of Defense. Members of the Board are hereby designated Administrative Judges. There shall be designated from among the appointed Judges of the Board a Chairman and two or more Vice Chairmen. Designation of the Chairman and Vice Chairmen shall be made by the Secretary of Defense, of nominees from Judges of the Board recommended by the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition, in coordination with the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition. When there is a vacancy, the incumbent is unavailable, or for appropriate Board administrative reasons, the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition or the Chairman may designate a Judge of the Board to serve as an Acting Chairman or Acting Vice Chairman.</P>
            <P>3. The Chairman of the Board shall be responsible for establishing appropriate divisions of the Board to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of appeals. The Chairman shall have authority to establish procedures for the issuance of Board decisions. The Chairman may refer an appeal of unusual difficulty, significant precedential importance, or serious dispute within the normal decision process for decision by a Senior Deciding Group established by the Chairman which shall have the authority to overturn prior Board precedent.</P>
            <P>4. It shall be the duty and obligation of the Judges of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals to decide appeals on the record of the appeal to the best of their knowledge and ability in accordance with applicable contract provisions and in accordance with law and regulation pertinent thereto.</P>
            <P>5. Any Judge of the Board or any examiner, designated by the Chairman, shall be authorized to hold hearings, examine witnesses, and receive evidence and argument. A Judge of the Board shall have authority to administer oaths and issue subpoenas as specified in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. In cases of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the Chairman may request orders of the court in the manner prescribed in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</P>
            <P>6. The Board shall have all powers necessary and incident to the proper performance of its duties. The Board has the authority to issue methods of procedure and rules and regulations for its conduct and for the preparation and presentation of appeals and issuance of opinions.</P>

            <P>7. The Chairman shall be responsible for the internal organization of the Board and for its administration. The Chairman shall provide within approved ceilings for the staffing of the Board with non-Judge personnel, including hearing examiners, as may <PRTPAGE P="661"/>be required for the performance of the functions of the Board. The Chairman shall appoint a Recorder of the Board. All personnel shall be responsible to and shall function under the direction, supervision and control of the Chairman.</P>
            <P>8. The Board will be serviced by the Department of the Army for administrative support as required for its operations. Administrative support will include budgeting, funding, fiscal control, manpower control and utilization, personnel administration, security administration, supplies, and other administrative services. The Departments of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense will participate in financing the Board's operations on an equal basis and to the extent determined by the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). The cost of processing appeals for departments and agencies other than those in the Department of Defense will be reimbursed.</P>
            <P>9. Within 30 days following the close of a fiscal year, the Chairman shall forward a report of the Board's transactions and proceedings for the preceding fiscal year to the Under Secretary of Defense responsible for acquisition, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and the Assistant Secretaries of the Military Departments responsible for acquisition.</P>
            <P>10. The Board shall have a seal bearing the following inscription: “Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.” This seal shall be affixed to all authentications of copies of records and to such other instruments as the Board may determine.</P>

            <P>11. This revised charter is effective upon the date of the signature of the Secretary of Defense.

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Jurisdiction for Considering Appeals</HD>
            <P>The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (referred to herein as the Board) has jurisdiction to decide any appeal from a final decision of a contracting officer, pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act, 41 U.S.C. 7101-7109, or its Charter, 48 CFR Chap. 2, App. A, Pt. 1, relative to a contract made by the Department of Defense, the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Air Force, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or any other department or agency, as permitted by law.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Location and Organization of the Board</HD>

            <P>(a) The Board's address is Skyline Six, Room 703, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3208; telephone 703-681-8500 (general), 703-681-8502 (Recorder). The Board's facsimile number is 703-681-8535. The Board's Recorder's email address is <E T="03">asbca.recorder@mail.mil.</E> The Board's Web site address is <E T="03">http://www.asbca.mil.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(b) The Board consists of a Chairman, two or more Vice Chairmen, and other Members, all of whom are attorneys at law duly licensed by a state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. Board Members are designated Administrative Judges.</P>
            <P>(c) There are a number of divisions of the Board, established by the Chairman in such manner as to provide for the most effective and expeditious handling of appeals. The Chairman and a Vice Chairman act as members of each division. Hearings may be held by an Administrative Judge or by a duly authorized examiner. Except for appeals processed under the expedited or accelerated procedure (see Rules 12.2(c) and 12.3(c)), the decision of a majority of a division constitutes the decision of the Board, unless the Chairman refers the appeal to the Board's Senior Deciding Group (consisting of the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, all division heads, and the Judge who drafted the decision), in which event a decision of a majority of that group constitutes the decision of the Board. Appeals referred to the Senior Deciding Group are those of unusual difficulty or significant precedential importance, or that have occasioned serious dispute within the normal division decision process.</P>

            <P>(d) The Board will to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes.<PRTPAGE P="662"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rule 1. Appeals</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Taking an Appeal</E>—For appeals subject to the Contract Disputes Act, notice of an appeal shall be in writing and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision. The appellant (contractor) should also furnish a copy of the notice of appeal to the contracting officer. For appeals not subject to the Contract Disputes Act, the contractor should refer to the Disputes clause in its contract for the time period in which it must file a notice of appeal.</P>
            <P>(1) Where the contractor has submitted a claim of $100,000 or less to the contracting officer and has requested a written decision within 60 days from receipt of the request, and the contracting officer has not provided a decision within that period, or where such a contractor request has not been made and the contracting officer has not issued a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the contractor has submitted a properly certified claim over $100,000 to the contracting officer or has submitted a claim that involves no monetary amount, and the contracting officer, within 60 days of receipt of the claim, fails to issue a decision or fails to provide the contractor with a reasonable date by which a decision will be issued, and the contracting officer has failed to issue a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (a) of this Rule, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.</P>
            <P>(3) A reasonable time shall be determined by taking into account such factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of the information provided by the contractor to support the claim.</P>
            <P>(4) Where an appeal is before the Board pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Rule, the Board may, at its option, stay further proceedings pending issuance of a final decision by the contracting officer within such period of time as is determined by the Board.</P>
            <P>(5) In lieu of filing a notice of appeal under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Rule, the contractor may petition the Board to direct the contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time as determined by the Board.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Contents of Notice of Appeal</E>—A notice of appeal shall indicate that an appeal is being taken and should identify the contract by number, the department and/or agency involved in the dispute, the decision from which the appeal is taken, and the amount in dispute, if any. A copy of the contracting officer's final decision, if any, should be attached to the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal should be signed by the appellant or by the appellant's duly authorized representative or attorney. The complaint referred to in Rule 6 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or the appellant may designate the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it otherwise fulfills the requirements of a complaint.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Docketing of Appeal</E>—When a notice of appeal has been received by the Board, it will be docketed. The Board will provide a written notice of docketing to the appellant and to the Government.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rule 4. Preparation, Content, Organization, Forwarding, and Status of Appeal File</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Duties of the Government</E>—Within 30 days of notice that an appeal has been filed, the Government shall transmit to the Board and the appellant an appeal file consisting of the documents the Government considers relevant to the appeal, including:</P>
            <P>(1) The decision from which the appeal is taken;</P>
            <P>(2) The contract, including pertinent specifications, amendments, plans, and drawings;</P>
            <P>(3) All correspondence between the parties relevant to the appeal, including any claim in response to which the decision was issued.</P>
            <P>The Government's appeal file may be supplemented at such times as are fair and reasonable and as ordered by the Board.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duties of the Appellant</E>—Within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the Government's appeal file, the appellant shall transmit to the Board and the Government any documents not contained therein that the appellant considers relevant to the appeal. Appellant's appeal file may be supplemented at such times as are fair and reasonable and as ordered by the Board.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Organization of Appeal File</E>—Documents in the appeal file may be originals or legible copies, and shall be arranged in chronological order where practicable, tabbed with sequential numbers, and indexed to identify the contents of the file. Any document without internal page numbers shall have page numbers added. All documents must be in English or include an English translation. Documents shall be submitted in 3-ring binders, with spines not wider than 3 inches wide, with labels identifying the name of the appeal, ASBCA number and tab numbers contained in each volume, on the front and spine of each volume. Each volume shall contain an index of the documents contained in the entire Rule 4 submission.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Status of Documents in Appeal File</E>—Documents contained in the appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to the admissibility of a particular document reasonably in advance of hearing or, if there is no hearing, of settling the record, or in any case as ordered by the Board. If such objection is made, the Board will constructively remove the document from the appeal file and permit the party offering the document to move its admission as evidence in accordance with Rules 10, 11, and 13.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rule 5. Time, Computation, and Extensions</HD>
            <P>(a) Where practicable, actions should be taken in less time than the time allowed. Where appropriate and justified, however, extensions of time will be granted. All requests for extensions of time should be in writing and indicate that the other party was contacted to seek its concurrence.</P>
            <P>(b) In computing any period of time, the day of the event from which the designated period of time begins to run will not be included, but the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, in which event the period will run to the next business day.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rule 6. Pleadings</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Appellant</E>—Within 30 days after receipt of notice of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board a complaint setting forth simple, concise, and direct statements of each of its claims. The complaint shall also set forth the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of <PRTPAGE P="664"/>each claim and the dollar amount claimed, if any. This pleading shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, although no particular form is required. Should the complaint not be timely received, the appellant's claim and notice of appeal may be deemed to set forth its complaint if, in the opinion of the Board, the issues before the Board are sufficiently defined, and the parties will be notified.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Government</E>—Within 30 days from receipt of the complaint, or the aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall file with the Board an answer thereto. The answer shall admit or deny the allegations of the complaint and shall set forth simple, concise, and direct statements of the Government's defenses to each claim asserted by the appellant, including any affirmative defenses. Should the answer not be timely received, the Board may enter a general denial on behalf of the Government, and the parties will be notified.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Foreign Law</E>—A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the law of a foreign country shall give notice in its pleadings or other reasonable written notice. The Board, in determining foreign law, may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under Rules 10, 11, or 13. The determination of foreign law shall be treated as a ruling on a question of law.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Further Pleadings</E>—The Board upon its own initiative or upon motion may order a party to make a more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an answer. The Board may permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions fair to both parties. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, but not raised by the pleadings, are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised therein. In such instances, motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, but are not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided however, that the objecting party may be granted an opportunity to meet such evidence.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rule 7. Motions</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Motions Generally</E>—The Board may entertain and rule upon motions and may defer ruling as appropriate. The Board will rule on motions so as to secure, to the fullest extent practicable, the informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of appeals. All motions should be filed as separate documents with an appropriate heading describing the motion. Oral argument on motions is subject to the discretion of the Board.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Jurisdictional Motions</E>—Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board should be promptly filed. An evidentiary hearing to address disputed jurisdictional facts will be afforded on application of either party or by order of the Board. The Board may defer its decision on the motion pending hearing on the merits. The Board may at any time and on its own initiative raise the issue of its jurisdiction, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Summary Judgment Motions</E>—</P>
            <P>(1) To facilitate disposition of such a motion, the parties should adhere to the following procedures. Where the parties agree that disposition by summary judgment or partial summary judgment is appropriate, they may file a stipulation of all material facts necessary for the Board to rule on the motion. Otherwise, the moving party should file with its motion a “Statement of Undisputed Material Facts,” setting forth the claimed undisputed material facts in separate, numbered paragraphs. The non-moving party should file a “Statement of Genuine Issues of Material Fact,” responding to each numbered paragraph proposed, demonstrating, where appropriate, the existence of material facts in dispute and if appropriate propose additional facts. The moving party and the non-moving party should submit a memorandum of law supporting or opposing summary judgment.</P>
            <P>(2) In deciding motions for summary judgment, the Board looks to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance. The parties should explicitly state and support by specific evidence all facts and legal arguments necessary to sustain a party's position. Each party should cite to the record and attach any additional evidence upon which it relies (e.g., affidavits, declarations, excerpts from depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions). The Board may accept a fact properly proposed and supported by one party as undisputed, unless the opposing party properly responds and establishes that it is in dispute.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Response to Motions</E>—A non-moving party has 30 days from receipt of a motion to file its response, unless a different period is ordered by the Board. A moving party has 30 days from receipt of a non-moving party's response to file a reply, unless a different period is ordered by the Board.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Rule 8. Discovery</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General Policy and Protective Orders</E>—The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. Within 45 days after the pleadings have been filed, the parties must confer concerning each party's discovery needs, including the scheduling of discovery and the production of electronically stored information. Absent stipulation or a Board order, no discovery may be served <PRTPAGE P="665"/>prior to this conference.

            <P>(a) Either party may elect to waive a hearing and to submit its case upon the record. Submission of a case without hearing does not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts supporting their allegations or defenses. Affidavits, declarations, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed in addition to the Rule 4 file if moved and accepted into evidence. Such submissions may be supplemented by briefs. The Board may designate, with notice to the parties, any document to be made part of the record.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Standards of awards</E>—A prevailing eligible applicant shall receive an award of fees and expenses incurred in connection with a CDA appeal, unless the position of the Government over which the applicant prevailed was substantially justified, or if special circumstances make the award unjust.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Allowable fees and other expenses</E>—</P>
            <P>(1) Fees and other expenses must be reasonable. Awards will be based upon the prevailing market rates, subject to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, for the kind and quality of services furnished by attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses.</P>
            <P>(2) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent may exceed $125 per hour. No expert witness shall be compensated at a rate in excess of the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the agency involved.</P>
            <P>(3) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project, prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the study or other matter was necessary in connection with the appeal and the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Time for filing of applications</E>—An application may be filed after an appellant has prevailed in the CDA appeal within 30 days after the Board's disposition of the appeal has become final.</P>

            <P>(3) When a compliant application has been timely filed, the Board, in order to obtain more detailed information, may require supplementation of the application.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Net worth exhibit</E>—Each applicant for which a determination of net worth is required under the EAJA should provide with its application a detailed net worth exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant when the CDA appeal was filed. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of assets, liabilities, and net worth.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Fees and other expenses exhibit</E>—The application should be accompanied by a detailed fees and other expenses exhibit fully documenting the fees and other expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project, for which an award is sought.

            <P>(j) <E T="03">Answer to application</E>—</P>
            <P>(1) Within 30 days after receipt by the Government of an application, the Government may file an answer. Unless the Government requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (2) below, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated by the Board at its discretion as a general denial to the application on behalf of the Government.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Government and the applicant believe that the matters raised in the application can be resolved by mutual agreement, they may jointly file a statement of intent to negotiate a settlement. Filing of this statement will extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days. Further extensions may be requested by the parties.</P>
            <P>(3) The answer will explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied upon in support of the Government's position.</P>
            <P>(4) An original and one copy of the answer should be filed with the Board. The Government will forward one copy to the applicant.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Reply</E>—Within 15 days after receipt of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. An original and one copy of the reply will be filed with the Board. The applicant will forward one copy to the Government.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Award proceedings</E>—</P>

            <P>(1) The Board may enter an order prescribing the procedure to be followed or take such other action as may be deemed appropriate under the EAJA. Further proceedings will be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application.<PRTPAGE P="671"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A request that the Board order further proceedings under this paragraph will describe the disputed issues, explain why the additional proceedings are deemed necessary to resolve the issues and specifically identify any information sought and its relationship to the disputed issues.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Evidence</E>—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Decisions on the merits</E>—When a CDA appeal is decided on the merits, other than by a consent judgment, the record relating to whether the Government's position under the EAJA was substantially justified will be limited to the record in the CDA appeal. Evidence relevant to other issues in the award proceeding may be submitted.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Other dispositions</E>—When a CDA appeal is settled, or decided by a consent judgment, either party in proceedings under the EAJA may, for good cause shown, supplement the record established in the CDA appeal with affidavits and other supporting evidence relating to whether the position of the agency was substantially justified or other issues in the award proceeding.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Decision</E>—Decisions under the EAJA will be rendered by the Administrative Judge or a majority of the judges who would have participated in a motion for reconsideration of the underlying CDA appeal. The decision of the Board will include written findings and conclusions and the basis therefor. The Board's decision on an application for fees and other expenses under the EAJA will be the final administrative decision regarding the EAJA application.</P>
            <P>(o) <E T="03">Motions for reconsideration</E>—Either party may file a motion for reconsideration. Motions for reconsideration must be filed within 30 days of receipt of the Board's EAJA decision. Extensions in the period to file a motion will not be granted. Extensions to file a memorandum in support of a timely filed motion may be granted.</P>
            <P>(p) <E T="03">Payment of Awards</E>—The Board's EAJA awards will be paid directly by the contracting agency over which the applicant prevailed in the underlying CDA appeal.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">ADDENDUM II</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Alternative Methods of Dispute Resolution</HD>
            <P>1. The Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 U.S.C. 7105(g)(1), states that boards of contract appeals “shall . . . to the fullest extent practicable provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes.” Resolution of a dispute at the earliest stage feasible, by the fastest and least expensive method possible, benefits both parties. To that end, the parties are encouraged to consider Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures for pre-claim and pre-final decision matters, as well as appeals pending before the Board. The Board may also conduct ADRs for any Federal agency. However, if the matter is not pending before the Board under its CDA jurisdiction, any settlement may not be paid out of the Judgment Fund.</P>
            <P>2. The ADR methods described in this Addendum are intended to suggest techniques that have worked in the past. Any appropriate method that brings the parties together in settlement, or partial settlement, of their disputes is a good method. The ADR methods listed are not intended to preclude the parties' use of other ADR techniques that do not require the Board's participation, such as settlement negotiations, fact-finding conferences or procedures, mediation, or minitrials not involving use of the Board's personnel. Any method, or combination of methods, including one that will result in a binding decision, may be selected by the parties without regard to the dollar amount in dispute.</P>
            <P>3. The parties must jointly request ADR procedures at the Board. The request must be approved by the Board. The Board may also schedule a conference to explore the desirability and selection of an ADR method and related procedures. If an ADR involving the Board's participation is requested and approved by the Board, a Neutral will be appointed. If an Administrative Judge has already been assigned to an appeal, the same judge will normally be assigned to be the Neutral in an ADR. If an Administrative Judge has not yet been assigned to the appeal, or if the subject of the ADR is a matter pending before the contracting officer prior to any appeal, the Board will appoint an Administrative Judge to be the Neutral. In such instances, as well as situations in which the parties prefer that an assigned Administrative Judge not be appointed to serve as the Neutral, the parties may submit a list of at least three preferred Administrative Judges and the Board will endeavor to accommodate their preferences.</P>
            <P>4. To facilitate full, frank and open discussion and presentations, any Neutral who has participated in a non-binding ADR procedure that has failed to resolve the underlying dispute will be recused from further participation in the matter unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing and the Board concurs. Further, the recused Neutral will not discuss the merits of the dispute or substantive matters involved in the ADR proceedings with other Board personnel.</P>

            <P>5. Written material prepared specifically for use in an ADR proceeding, oral presentations made at an ADR proceeding, and all discussions in connection with such proceedings between the parties and the Neutral are confidential and, unless otherwise specifically agreed by the parties, inadmissible as evidence in any pending or future Board proceeding involving the parties or matter in <PRTPAGE P="672"/>dispute. However, evidence otherwise admissible before the Board is not rendered inadmissible because of its use in the ADR proceeding.</P>
            <P>6. The ADR method and the procedures and requirements implementing the ADR method will be prescribed by the written agreement of the parties and approved by the Board. ADR methods can be used successfully at any stage of the litigation.</P>
            <P>7. The following are examples of ADR methods commonly used at the Board:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Nonbinding</E>—</P>
            <P>Mediations: A Neutral is an Administrative Judge who will not normally hear or have any formal or informal decision-making authority in the matter and who is appointed for the purpose of facilitating settlement. In many circumstances, settlement can be fostered by a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position with the Neutral. The agenda for meetings with the Neutral will be flexible to accommodate the requirements of the case. To further the settlement effort, the Neutral may meet with the parties either jointly or individually. A Neutral's recommendations are not binding on the parties. When this method is selected, the ADR agreement must contain a provision in which the parties and counsel agree not to subpoena the Neutral in any legal action or administrative proceeding of any kind to produce any notes or documents related to the ADR proceeding or to testify concerning any such notes or documents or concerning his/her thoughts or impressions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Binding</E>—</P>
            <P>Summary Proceeding With Binding Decision: A summary proceeding with binding decision is a procedure whereby the resolution of the appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an Administrative Judge. A binding “bench” decision may be issued upon conclusion of the proceeding, or a binding summary written decision will be issued by the judge no later than ten days following the later of conclusion of the proceeding or receipt of a transcript. The parties must agree in the ADR agreement that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the Board under this method shall be final, conclusive, not appealable, and may not be set aside, except for fraud. All such decisions, rulings, and orders will have no precedential value. Pre-hearing, hearing, and post-hearing procedures and rules applicable to appeals generally will be modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Other Agreed Methods</E>—</P>
            <P>The parties and the Board may agree upon other informal methods, binding or nonbinding that are structured and tailored to suit the requirements of the individual case.</P>
            <P>8. The above-listed ADR procedures are intended to shorten and simplify the Board's more formalized procedures. Generally, if the parties resolve their dispute by agreement, they benefit in terms of cost and time savings and maintenance or restoration of amicable relations. The Board will not view the parties' participation in ADR proceedings as a sign of weakness. Any method adopted for dispute resolution depends upon both parties having a firm, good faith commitment to resolve their differences. Absent such intention, the best structured dispute resolution procedure is unlikely to be successful.</P>

            <SECHD>F-101 General.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) This appendix contains procedures and instructions for the use, preparation, and distribution of the Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) Receiving Report (RR), WAWF Reparable Receiving Report (WAWF RRR) , the WAWF Energy RR, and commercial shipping/packing lists used to document Government contract quality assurance. The WAWF RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report (MIRR). The WAWF Energy RR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for overland shipments and DD Form 250-1, Tanker/Barge Material Inspection and Receiving Report, for waterborne shipments. The WAWF RRR is the electronic equivalent of the DD Form 250 for repair, maintenance, or overhaul of Government-furnished property.</P>
            <P>(b) The use of the DD Form 250 series documents is on an exception basis (see DFARS 232.7002(a)) because use of the WAWF RR is now required by most DoD contracts. WAWF provides for electronic preparation and documentation of acceptance of supplies and services, and electronic invoicing. In addition WAWF allows the printing of a RR that can be used as a packing list or when a signed copy is required.</P>
            <SECHD>F-102 Applicability.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, requires payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF in nearly all cases.</P>
            <P>(b) When DoD provides quality assurance or acceptance services for non-DoD activities, prepare a MIRR using the instructions in this appendix, unless otherwise specified in the contract.</P>
            <SECHD>F-103 Use.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) The WAWF RR, WAWF RRR and the DD Form 250 are multipurpose reports used—</P>
            <P>(1) To provide evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin or destination;</P>
            <P>(2) To provide evidence of acceptance at origin, destination, or other;</P>
            <P>(3) For packing lists;</P>
            <P>(4) For receiving;</P>
            <P>(5) For shipping;</P>
            <P>(6) As a contractor invoice (the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR or DD Form 250 alone cannot be used as an invoice, however the option exists to create an invoice from the Receiving Report or a Combo (Invoice and Receiving Report) both of which minimize data entry); and</P>
            <P>(7) As commercial invoice support.</P>
            <P>(b) Do not use the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR or the DD Form 250 for shipments—</P>
            <P>(1) By subcontractors, unless the subcontractor is shipping directly to the Government; or</P>

            <P>(2) Of contract inventory. The WAWF Property Transfer document should be used for this type of shipment. Training for the preparation of this document type is available at <E T="03">https://wawftraining.eb.mil</E>, under the Property Transfer and Receipt section.</P>
            <P>(c) The contractor prepares the WAWF RR, WAWF RRR or the DD Form 250, except for entries that an authorized Government representative is required to complete. When using a paper DD Form 250, the contractor shall furnish sufficient copies of the completed form, as directed by the Government representative.</P>
            <P>(d) Use the WAWF Energy RR or the DD Form 250-1:</P>
            <P>(1) For bulk movements of petroleum products by tanker or barge to cover—</P>
            <P>(i) Origin or destination acceptance of cargo; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Shipment or receipt of Government owned products.</P>
            <P>(2) To send quality data to the point of acceptance in the case of origin inspection on FOB destination deliveries or preinspection at product source. Annotate the forms with the words “INSPECTED FOR QUALITY ONLY.”</P>
            <P>(e) In addition to the above uses, the WAWF RR and WAWF RRR provide additional functionality, not provided by the paper DD Form 250 that complies with the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) Item Unique Identification (IUID), when the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Unique Identification and Valuation is used in the contract, reporting of IUID data is required. WAWF captures the IUID data and forwards the data to the IUID registry after acceptance. WAWF shall be used to report Unique Item Identifiers (UIIs) at the line item level, unless an exception to WAWF applies, and can also be used to report UIIs embedded at the line item level.</P>
            <P>(2) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), when the clause at DFARS 252.211-7006, Radio Frequency Identification, is used in the contract, WAWF will capture the RFID information and forward the data to the receiving location. Using WAWF is the only way a contractor can comply with the clause to furnish RFID data via an Advance Shipping Notice (ASN). The RFID information may be added at time of submission, or via the WAWF Pack Later functionality after acceptance.</P>

            <P>(3) Reporting of Government-furnished property, when the clause at DFARS 252.211-7007, Reporting of Government-Furnished Property, is used in the contract, use of the WAWF RRR will capture the shipment of Government-furnished property items after <PRTPAGE P="674"/>acceptance of repair services and forward the data to the IUID registry. WAWF is the only way a contractor can report the transfer of Government-furnished property items in the IUID registry.</P>
            <SECHD>F-104 Application.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">WAWF RR and DD Form 250.</E> (1) Use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for delivery of contract line, subline, exhibit line, or exhibit subline items. Do not use the WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for those exhibit line or exhibit subline items on a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, which indicate no DD Form 250 is required.</P>
            <P>(2) If the shipped to, marked for, shipped from, mode of shipment, contract quality assurance and acceptance data are the same for more than one shipment made on the same day under the same contract, contractors may prepare one WAWF RR or DD Form 250 to cover all such shipments.</P>
            <P>(3) If the volume of the shipment precludes the use of a single car, truck, or other vehicle, prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for the contents of each vehicle.</P>
            <P>(4) When a shipment is consigned to an Air Force activity and the shipment includes items of more than one Federal supply class (FSC) or material management code (MMC), prepare a separate WAWF RR or DD Form 250 for items of each of the FSCs or MMCs in the shipment. However, the cognizant Government representative may authorize a single WAWF RR or DD Form 250, listing each of the FSCs or MMCs included in the shipment on a separate continuation sheet. The MMC appears as a suffix to the national stock number applicable to the item.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Consolidation of Petroleum Shipments on a Single WAWF RR or DD Form 250.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Contiguous United States.</E> Contractors may consolidate multiple car or truck load shipments of petroleum made on the same day, to the same destination, against the same contract line item, on one WAWF RR or DD Form 250. To permit verification of motor deliveries, assign each load a load number which can be identified to the shipment number in Block 2 of the DD Form 250. Include a shipping document (commercial or Government) with each individual load showing as a minimum—</P>
            <P>(A) The shipper;</P>
            <P>(B) Shipping point;</P>
            <P>(C) Consignee;</P>
            <P>(D) Contract and line item number;</P>
            <P>(E) Product identification;</P>
            <P>(F) Gross gallons (bulk only);</P>

            <SECHD>Part 3—Preparation of the Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) Receiving Report (WAWF RRR), and WAWF Energy RR</SECHD>
            <SECHD>F-301 Preparation instructions.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Preparation instructions and training for the WAWF RR are available at <E T="03">https://wawftraining.eb.mil.</E> The instructions on preparing a WAWF RR are part of the Vendor Training section.</P>
            <P>(2) Prime contractors can direct subcontractors to prepare and submit documents in WAWF by giving their subcontractors access to WAWF via the creation of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) extension to the prime CAGE.</P>
            <P>(3) If the contract is in Electronic Data Access (EDA) (DoD's contract repository), then the WAWF system will automatically populate all available and applicable contract data.</P>
            <P>(i) When source acceptance is required, WAWF will populate the “Inspect By” with the “Admin by” Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC). The vendor shall change the DoDAAC if Government Source Inspection (GSI) is performed at other than the “Admin By.”</P>
            <P>(ii) Any fields that have been pre-filled may be changed.</P>
            <P>(iii) WAWF will also verify that CAGE codes are valid and active in the System for Award Management (SAM), and that DoDAACs and Military Assistance Program Address Codes (MAPACs) are valid in Defense Automatic Addressing System (DAAS).</P>
            <P>(4) WAWF will populate the address information for CAGE codes, DODAACs, and MAPACs from SAM and DAAS. These sites are the DoD definitive sources for address information. Any fields that have been pre-filled may be changed or additional information added.</P>
            <P>(5) Do not include classified information in WAWF.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Completion instructions.</E>(1) Contract no/delivery order no.</P>
            <P>(i) For stand-alone contracts, enter the 13-position alpha-numeric basic Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID) of the contract. For task and delivery orders numbered in accordance with FAR 4.1603 and DFARS 204.1603, enter the 13-character order number. The contract or agreement number under which the order was placed may be omitted from the WAWF RR. Alternatively, the contractor may choose to enter the contract number on the WAWF RR in addition to the 13-character order number. If the order has only a four-position alpha-numeric call or order serial number, enter both the 13-position basic contract PIID and the four-position order number.</P>
            <P>(ii) Except as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this appendix, do not enter supplementary numbers used in conjunction with basic PIIDs to identify—</P>
            <P>(A) Modifications of contracts and agreements;</P>
            <P>(B) Modifications to calls or orders; or</P>
            <P>(C) Document numbers representing contracts written between contractors.</P>
            <P>(iii) When shipping instructions are furnished and shipment is made before receipt of the confirming contract modification (SF 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract), enter a comment in the Misc. Info Tab to this effect. This will appear in the Comments section of the printed WAWF RR.</P>
            <P>(2) Shipment No.</P>

            <P>(i) The shipment number format requires first three data positions to be alpha, fourth position alpha-numeric and last three positions numeric, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> DFAR001 or DAR0001. Any document used as a packing list must include the shipment number information.</P>
            <P>(A) The prime contractor shall control and assign the shipment number prefix. The shipment number shall consist of three alphabetic characters for each “Shipped From” address. The shipment number prefix shall be different for each “Shipped From” address and shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract. The prime contractor may assign separate prefixes when shipments are made from different locations within a facility identified by one “Shipped From” address.</P>
            <P>(B) Number the first shipment 0001 for shipments made under the contract or contract and order number from each “Shipped From” address, or shipping location within the “Shipped From” address. Consecutively number all subsequent shipments with the identical shipment number prefix. While shipments should be created sequentially they can be released and accepted out of sequence.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Use alpha-numeric serial numbers when more than 9,999 numbers are required. Serially assign alpha-numeric numbers with the alpha in the first position (the letters I and O shall not be used) followed by the three-position numeric serial number. Use the following alpha-numeric sequence:
            </P>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">A000 through A999 (10,000 through 10,999)</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">B000 through B999 (11,000 through 11,999)</FP>
            <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Z000 through Z999 (34,000 through 34,999)</FP>
            
            <PRTPAGE P="676"/>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) When this series is completely used, the shipment number prefix will have to be changed when the series is completely used. WAWF will not allow duplicate shipment numbers to be created against a contract or contract and delivery order.</P>
            <P>(ii) Reassign the shipment number of the initial shipment where a “Replacement Shipment” is involved (see paragraph (b)(16)(iv)(F) of this appendix).</P>
            <P>(iii) The prime contractor shall control deliveries and on the final shipment of the contract shall end the shipment number with a “Z.” Where the final shipment is from other than the prime contractor's plant, the prime contractor may elect either to—</P>
            <P>(A) Direct the subcontractor making the final shipment to end that shipment number with a “Z”; or</P>
            <P>(B) Upon determination that all subcontractors have completed their shipments, to correct the DD Form 250 (see F-304) covering the final shipment made from the prime contractor's plant by addition of a “Z” to that shipment number.</P>
            <P>(iv) Contractors follow the procedures in F-305 to use commercial invoices.</P>
            <P>(3) Date shipped. Enter the date the shipment is released to the carrier or the date the services are completed. If the shipment will be released after the date of contract quality assurance and/or acceptance, enter the estimated date of release. When the date is estimated, enter an “E” or select an “E” from the drop down menu in the “Estimated” block after the date. Do not delay submission of the WAWF RR for lack of entry of the actual shipping date. Correction of the WAWF RR is not required to show the actual shipping date (see F-303). Once the document is submitted the shipment date cannot be changed.</P>
            <P>(4) B/L TCN. When applicable, enter—</P>
            <P>(i) The commercial or Government bill of lading number after “B/L;” WAWF provides the capability to separately and correctly identify the Government Bill of Lading (GBL) from a Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL). An authorized user will select whether the entered bill of lading number is either a GBL number or a CBL number.</P>
            <P>(ii) The transportation control number must be a 17 alpha/numeric digit min/max field, and WAWF provides the capability to enter two secondary transportation tracking numbers.</P>
            <P>(5) Line haul mode. Select the Line Haul Mode of Shipment code from a drop down menu in WAWF.</P>
            <P>(6) Inspection and acceptance point. Enter an “S” for Origin or “D” for Destination. In addition to “S” and “D,” WAWF allows acceptance at Other (O). For purposes of conforming to contract, “O” is equivalent to “D”. In WAWF, destination acceptance is performed by the “Ship to” DODAAC organization and “Other” permits the acceptance of destination documents at a location other than the “Ship to.” The goods or services will be shipped to one location and the paperwork will be routed to another location for the actual acceptance.</P>

If the contract contains NSNs as well as other identification (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> part numbers) the contractor should place the NSN information in the Stock Part Number field and the remaining numbers in the line item description field. The data entered in the NSN field must reflect the NSN of the material item being shipped and should be a valid NSN, 13 positions in length. In the “Type” drop-down field, select the corresponding type for the data entered. If no National Stock Number (NSN) or other valid “Type” is available, the word “NONE” may be entered for the Stock/Part Number, with a corresponding “Type” of any value <PRTPAGE P="677"/>other than NSN selected from the drop-down box.</P>
            <P>(B) In the description field, if required by the contract for control purposes, enter: The make, model, serial number, lot, batch, hazard indicator, or similar description.</P>
            <P>(C) The Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) must be placed on the MILSTRIP Tab, not in the line item description field. Enter the MILSTRIP data for each CLIN when MILSTRIP data is identified in the contract.</P>

Enter notes taking exception in Misc. Info Tab comment field or on attached supporting documents with an appropriate block cross-reference.</P>
            <P>(ii) When a shipment is authorized under an alternative release procedure, contractors will execute the alternative release procedure in WAWF by including the appropriate indicator in the electronic transaction rather than through inclusion or attachment of the text of the certificate. The alternative release procedure only provides for release of shipment; Government acceptance must still be indicated by a Government official's signature on the WAWF RR.</P>
            <P>(iii) When contract terms provide for use of Certificate of Conformance and shipment is made under these terms, contractors will execute Certificates in WAWF by including the appropriate indicator in the electronic transaction rather than through inclusion or attachment of the text of the certificate.

            <SECHD>H-100 Scope.</SECHD>
            <P>This appendix provides uniform debarment and suspension procedures to be followed by all debarring and suspending officials.</P>
            <SECHD>H-101 Notification.</SECHD>
            <P>Contractors will be notified of the proposed debarment or suspension in accordance with FAR 9.406-3 or 9.407-3. A copy of the record which formed the basis for the decision by the debarring and suspending official will be made available to the contractor. If there is a reason to withhold from the contractor any portion of the record, the contractor will be informed of what is withheld and the reasons for such withholding.</P>
            <SECHD>H-102 Nature of proceeding.</SECHD>
            <P>There are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the suspension or debarment process. The first is the presentation of matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the contractor.</P>
            <P>The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the contractor's presentation of matters in opposition raises a genuine dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based upon an indictment or in a proposed debarment action based upon a conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-filling proceeding concerning the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the extent that the proposed action stems from the contractor's affiliation with an individual or firm indicted or convicted, or the subject of a civil judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is raised as to the question of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.</P>
            <SECHD>H-103 Presentation of matters in opposition.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in opposition may be presented in person, in writing, or through a representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any combination of the foregoing methods, but if a contractor desires to present matters in person or through a representative, any written material should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are presented in a single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending indictment or allegations of wrongdoing that the contractor believes may lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and suspending official or designee to provide information as to the contractor's present responsibility.</P>

            <P>(b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial in nature. The <PRTPAGE P="690"/>debarring and suspending official and/or other agency representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its representative making the presentation. The contractor may select the individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor's behalf; individual respondents or principals of a business firm respondent may attend and speak for themselves.</P>
            <P>(c) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor may submit matters in opposition within 30 days from receipt of the notice of suspension or proposed debarment.</P>
            <P>(d) The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment includes the opportunity to present matters concerning the duration of the debarment.</P>
            <SECHD>H-104 Fact-finding.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the contractor's presentation has raised a genuine dispute of material fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against debarment or continued suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring and suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists, a designated fact-finder will conduct the fact-finding proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts in dispute as determined by the debarring and suspending official.</P>
            <P>(b) The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 working days of the contractor's presentation of matters in opposition. An official record will be made of the fact-finding proceeding.</P>
            <P>(c) The Government's representative and the contractor will have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issues. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative in the fact-finding proceeding.</P>
            <P>(d) Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.</P>
            <P>(e) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceeding and that any false testimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination.</P>
            <SECHD>H-105 Timing requirements.</SECHD>
            <P>All timing requirements set forth in these procedures may be extended by the debarring and suspending official for good cause.</P>
            <SECHD>H-106 Subsequent to fact-finding.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) Written findings of fact will be prepared by the fact-finder as mandated by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)(i).</P>
            <P>(b) The fact-finder will determine the disputed fact(s) by a preponderance of the evidence. A copy of the findings of fact will be provided to the debarring and suspending official, the Government's representative, and the contractor.</P>
            <P>(c) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether to continue the suspension or to debar the contractor based upon the entire administrative record, including the findings of fact.</P>
            <P>(d) Prompt written notice of the debarring and suspending official's decision will be sent to the contractor and any affiliates involved, in compliance with FAR 9.406-3(e) and 9.407-3(d)(4).</P>

            <P>(5) Loans.</P>
            <P>(6) Assistance that the mentor firm obtains for the protégé firm from one or more of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Small Business Development Centers established pursuant to section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648).</P>
            <P>(ii) Entities providing procurement technical assistance pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Chapter 142 (Procurement Technical Assistance Centers).</P>
            <P>(iii) Historically Black colleges and universities.</P>
            <P>(iv) Minority institutions of higher education.</P>
            <P>(v) Women's business centers described in section 29 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656).</P>

            <P>(e) Pursuant to FAR 31.109, approved mentor firms seeking either reimbursement or credit are strongly encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with the contracting officer responsible for determining final indirect cost rates under FAR 42.705. The purpose of the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs of the developmental assistance pursuant to the mentor-protégé agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor firm to avoid possible <PRTPAGE P="694"/>subsequent dispute based on questions related to reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such costs and to address the need for any changes to their cost accounting practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-protégé agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether costs will be reimbursed or credited.</P>
            <P>(f) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protégé agreement is distinct from, and must not duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm's subcontracts. Costs associated with the latter must be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor's approved accounting practices; they are not considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or reimbursement under the Program.</P>

            <P>(l) Procedures for the mentor firm to notify the protégé firm in writing at least 30 days in advance of the mentor firm's intent to voluntarily withdraw its participation in the Program.

            <SECHD>I-109 Reimbursable agreements.</SECHD>
            <P>The following program provisions apply to all reimbursable mentor-protégé agreements:</P>
            <P>(a) Assistance provided in the form of progress payments to a protégé firm in excess of the customary progress payment rate for the firm will be reimbursed only if implemented in accordance with FAR 32.504(c).</P>
            <P>(b) Assistance provided in the form of advance payments will be reimbursed only if the payments have been provided to a protégé firm under subcontract terms and conditions similar to those in the clause at FAR 52.232-12, Advance Payments. Reimbursement of any advance payments will be made pursuant to the inclusion of the clause at DFARS 252.232-7005, Reimbursement of Subcontractor Advance Payments—DoD Pilot Mentor-Protégé Program, in appropriate contracts. In requesting reimbursement, the mentor firm agrees that the risk of any financial loss due to the failure or inability of a protégé firm to repay any unliquidated advance payments will be the sole responsibility of the mentor firm.</P>
            <P>(c) The primary forms of developmental assistance authorized for reimbursement under the Program are identified in I-106(d). On a case-by-case basis, Component Directors, SBP, at their discretion, may approve additional incidental expenses for reimbursement, provided these expenses do not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated cost of the agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) The total amount reimbursed to a mentor firm for costs of assistance furnished to a protégé firm in a fiscal year may not exceed $1,000,000 unless the cognizant Component Director, SBP, determines in writing that unusual circumstances justify reimbursement at a higher amount.

            <P>(e) DoD may not reimburse any fee to the mentor firm for services provided to the protégé firm pursuant to I-106(d)(6) or for business development expenses incurred by <PRTPAGE P="696"/>the mentor firm under a contract awarded to the mentor firm while participating in a joint venture with the protégé firm.</P>
            <P>(f) Developmental assistance costs that are incurred pursuant to an approved reimbursable mentor-protégé agreement, and have been charged to, but not reimbursed through, a separate contract, or through a separately priced contract line item added to a DoD contract, will not be otherwise reimbursed, as either a direct or indirect cost, under any other DoD contract, irrespective of whether the costs have been recognized for credit against applicable subcontracting goals.</P>
            <SECHD>I-110 Credit agreements.</SECHD>
            <SECHD>I-110.1 Program provisions applicable to credit agreements.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) Developmental assistance costs incurred by a mentor firm for providing assistance to a protégé firm pursuant to an approved credit mentor-protégé agreement may be credited as if the costs were incurred under a subcontract award to that protégé, for the purpose of determining the performance of the mentor firm in attaining an applicable subcontracting goal established under any contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, or the provisions of the DoD Test Program for Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans . Unreimbursed developmental assistance costs incurred for a protégé firm that is an eligible entity employing severely disabled individuals may be credited toward the mentor firm's small disadvantaged business subcontracting goal, even if the protégé firm is not a small disadvantaged business concern.</P>
            <P>(b) Costs that have been reimbursed through inclusion in indirect expense pools may also be credited as subcontract awards for determining the performance of the mentor firm in attaining an applicable subcontracting goal established under any contract containing a subcontracting plan. However, costs that have not been reimbursed because they are not reasonable, allocable, or allowable will not be recognized for crediting purposes.</P>
            <P>(c) Other costs that are not eligible for reimbursement pursuant to I-106(d) may be recognized for credit only if requested, identified, and incorporated in an approved mentor-protégé agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) The amount of credit a mentor firm may receive for any such unreimbursed developmental assistance costs must be equal to—</P>
            <P>(1) Four times the total amount of such costs attributable to assistance provided by small business development centers, historically Black colleges and universities, minority institutions, and procurement technical assistance centers.</P>
            <P>(2) Three times the total amount of such costs attributable to assistance furnished by the mentor's employees.</P>
            <P>(3) Two times the total amount of other such costs incurred by the mentor in carrying out the developmental assistance program.</P>
            <SECHD>I-110.2 Credit adjustments.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) Adjustments may be made to the amount of credit claimed if the Director, SBP, OUSD(A&amp;S), determines that—</P>
            <P>(1) A mentor firm's performance in the attainment of its subcontracting goals through actual subcontract awards declined from the prior fiscal year without justifiable cause; and</P>
            <P>(2) Imposition of such a limitation on credit appears to be warranted to prevent abuse of this incentive for the mentor firm's participation in the Program.</P>
            <P>(b) The mentor firm must be afforded the opportunity to explain the decline in small business subcontract awards before imposition of any such limitation on credit. In making the final decision to impose a limitation on credit, the Director, SBP, OUSD(A&amp;S), must consider—</P>
            <P>(1) The mentor firm's overall small business participation rates (in terms of percentages of subcontract awards and dollars awarded) as compared to the participation rates existing during the 2 fiscal years prior to the firm's admission to the Program;</P>
            <P>(2) The mentor firm's aggregate prime contract awards during the prior 2 fiscal years and the total amount of subcontract awards under such contracts; and</P>
            <P>(3) Such other information the mentor firm may wish to submit.</P>
            <P>(c) The decision of the Director, SBP, OUSD(A&amp;S), regarding the imposition of a limitation on credit will be final.</P>
            <SECHD>I-111 Agreement terminations.</SECHD>
            <P>(a) Mentors and/or protégés must send a copy of any termination notices to the cognizant Component Director, SBP, that approved the agreement, and the DCMA administrative contracting officer responsible for conducting the annual review pursuant to I-113.</P>
            <P>(b) For reimbursable agreements, mentors must also send copies of any termination to the program manager and to the contracting officer.</P>
            <P>(c) Termination of a mentor-protégé agreement will not impair the obligations of the mentor firm to perform pursuant to its contractual obligations under Government contracts and subcontracts.</P>

            <P>(d) Termination of all or part of the mentor-protégé agreement will not impair the obligations of the protégé firm to perform pursuant to its contractual obligations under any contract awarded to the protégé firm by the mentor firm.<PRTPAGE P="697"/>
