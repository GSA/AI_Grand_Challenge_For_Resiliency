      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SECTNO>52.101</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Using part 52.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition. Modification,</E> as used in this subpart, means a minor change in the details of a provision or clause that is specifically authorized by the FAR and does not alter the substance of the provision or clause (see 52.104).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Numbering</E>—(1) <E T="03">FAR provisions and clauses.</E> Subpart 52.2 sets forth the texts of all FAR provisions and clauses, each in its own separate subsection. The subpart is arranged by subject matter, in the same order as, and keyed to, the parts of the FAR. Each FAR provision or clause is uniquely identified. All FAR provision and clause numbers begin with “52.2,” since the text of all FAR provisions and clauses appear in subpart 52.2. The next two digits of the provision or clause number correspond to the number of the FAR subject part in which the provision or clause is prescribed. The FAR provision or clause number is then completed by a hyphen and a sequential number assigned within each section of subpart 52.2. The following example illustrates the makeup of the FAR provision or clause number:</P>
              <GPH DEEP="77" SPAN="1">
                <GID>EC01MY91.000</GID>
              </GPH>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR.</E> (i) Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR are—</P>
              <P>(A) Prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition regulations issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the agency as a whole;</P>
              <P>(B) Prescribed and included in a regulation issued by a suborganization of an agency to satisfy the needs of that particular suborganization; or</P>
              <P>(C) Developed for use at a suborganizational level of an agency, not meant for repetitive use, but intended to meet the needs of an individual acquisition and, thus, impractical to include in either an agency or suborganization acquisition regulation. (See 1.301(c).)</P>
              <P>(ii) Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency acquisition regulations shall be in full text and the prescription for the use of each shall be included. Supplemental provisions or clauses published in agency acquisition regulations shall be numbered in the same manner in which FAR provisions and clauses are numbered except that—</P>

              <P>(A) If it is included in an agency acquisition regulation that is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and is codified in Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (48 CFR), the number shall be preceded by the chapter number within 48 CFR assigned by the CFR staff; and</P>
              <P>(B) The sequential number shall be “70” or a higher number (see 1.303).</P>
              <P>(iii) The sequential number at the end of the number of a provision or clause that supplements the FAR, like its counterpart at the end of any FAR provision or clause number, indicates the subsection location of the provision or clause in subpart 52.2 of the agency acquisition regulation that contains its full text. If, for example, an agency acquisition regulation contains only one provision followed by only one clause supplementing the FAR in its section 52.236 (Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts), then the sequential numbers would be “70” for the provision and “71” for the clause.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Prescriptions.</E> Each provision or clause in subpart 52.2 is prescribed at that place in the FAR text where the subject matter of the provision or clause receives its primary treatment. The prescription includes all conditions, requirements, and instructions for using the provision or clause and its alternates, if any. The provision or clause may be referred to in other FAR locations.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Introductory text.</E> Within subpart 52.2, the introductory text of each provision or clause includes a cross-reference to the location in the FAR subject text that prescribes its use.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Matrix.</E> (1) The matrix in subpart 52.3 contains a column for each principal type and/or purpose of contract <PRTPAGE P="15"/>(e.g., fixed-price supply, cost reimbursement research and development). The matrix lists the—</P>
              <P>(i) Required solicitation provisions;</P>
              <P>(ii) Required-when-applicable solicitation provisions;</P>
              <P>(iii) Optional solicitation provisions;</P>
              <P>(iv) Required contract clauses;</P>
              <P>(v) Required-when-applicable contract clauses; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Optional contract clauses.</P>
              <P>(2) For each provision or clause listed, the matrix provides information on—</P>
              <P>(i) Whether incorporation by reference is or is not authorized (see 52.102);</P>
              <P>(ii) The section of the Uniform Contract Format (UCF) in which it is to be located, if it is used in an acquisition that is subject to the UCF;</P>
              <P>(iii) Its number;</P>
              <P>(iv) The citation of the FAR text that prescribes its use; and</P>

However, the contracting officer, upon request, shall provide the full text of any provision or clause incorporated by reference.</P>
              <P>(c) Agency approved provisions and clauses prescribed in agency acquisition regulations, and provisions and clauses not authorized by subpart 52.3 to be incorporated by reference, need not be incorporated in full text, provided the contracting officer includes in the solicitation and contract a statement that—</P>
              <P>(1) Identifies all provisions and clauses that require completion by the offeror or prospective contractor;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Identification of provisions and clauses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Whenever any FAR provision or clause is used without deviation in a solicitation or contract, whether it is incorporated by reference or in full text, it shall be identified by number, title, and date. This identification shall also be used if the FAR provision or clause is used with an authorized deviation, except that the contracting officer shall then insert “(DEVIATION)” after the date. Solicited firms and contractors will be advised of the meaning of this insertion through the use of the (1) provision at 52.252-5, Authorized Deviations in Provisions, or (2) clause at 52.252-6, Authorized Deviations in Clauses. The above mentioned provision and clause are prescribed in 52.107 (e) and (f).</P>
              <P>(b) Any provision or clause that supplements the FAR whether it is incorporated by reference or in full text shall be clearly identified by number, title, date, and name of the regulation. When a supplemental provision or clause is used with an authorized deviation, insert “(DEVIATION)” after the name of the regulation.</P>
              <P>(c) A provision or clause of the type described in 52.101(b)(2)(i)(C) shall be identified by the title, date, and the name of the agency or suborganization within the agency that developed it.</P>
              <P>(d) Except for provisions or clauses covered by 52.103(c), the following hypothetical examples illustrate how a provision or clause that supplements the FAR shall be identified when it is incorporated in solicitations and/or contracts by reference or in full text:</P>

              <P>(1) If part 14 (Sealed Bidding) of the X Agency Acquisition Regulation, published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and codified as Chapter 99 in 48 CFR, prescribes the use of a provision entitled “Bid Envelopes,” dated October 1983, and that provision is sequentially the first provision or clause appearing in Section 52.214 of the X Agency Acquisition Regulation, then the identification of that provision shall be “9952.214-70—Bid Envelopes (OCT 1983).”</P>

              <P>(2) Assume that Y, a major organizational element of the X Agency, is authorized to issue the Y Acquisition Regulation, which is not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and codified in 48 CFR. If part 36 (Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts) of the Y Acquisition Regulation prescribes the use of a clause entitled “Refrigerated Display Cases,” dated March 1983, pertaining to a specialized type of construction work, and that clause is sequentially the second provision or clause appearing in Section 52.236 of the Y Acquisition Regulation, then the identification of that clause shall be “52.236-71—Refrigerated Display Cases (MAR 1983)—Y Acquisition Regulation.”</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for modifying and completing provisions and clauses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The contracting officer must not modify provisions and clauses unless the FAR authorizes their modification. For example—</P>
              <P>(1) “The contracting officer may use a period shorter than 60 days (but not less than 30 days) in paragraph (x) of the clause”; or</P>
              <P>(2) “The contracting officer may substitute the words ‘task order’ for the word ‘Schedule’ wherever that word appears in the clause.”</P>

              <P>(b) When modifying provisions or clauses incorporated by reference, insert the changed wording directly <PRTPAGE P="17"/>below the title of the provision or clause identifying to the lowest level necessary (e.g., paragraph, sentence, word), to clearly indicate what is being modified.</P>
              <P>(c) When modifying provisions or clauses incorporated in full text, modify the language directly by substituting the changed wording as permitted.</P>
              <P>(d) When completing blanks in provisions or clauses incorporated by reference, insert the fill-in information directly below the title of the provision or clause identifying to the lowest level necessary to clearly indicate the blanks being filled in.</P>
              <P>(e) When completing blanks in provisions or clauses incorporated in full text, insert the fill-in information in the blanks of the provision or clause.</P>

The alternates to each provision or clause are titled “Alternate I,” “Alternate II,” “Alternate III,” etc.</P>
              <P>(b) When an alternate is used, its date shall be cited along with the date of the basic provision or clause; e.g., 52.209-3 FIRST ARTICLE APPROVAL—CONTRACTOR TESTING (OCT 1983)—ALTERNATE I (DEC 1983).</P>
              <P>(c) Under certain circumstances, a provision or clause may be used with two or more alternates. In these circumstances, each of the applicable alternates shall be cited, whether incorporated by reference or in full text; e.g., 52.209-3 FIRST ARTICLE APPROVAL—CONTRACTOR TESTING (OCT 1983)—ALTERNATE I (DEC 1983) AND ALTERNATE II (FEB 1984). However, under no circumstances may an alternate to a specific provision or clause be applied to any other provision or clause.</P>

                <P>(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.

This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.</P>

                <P>(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award <PRTPAGE P="51"/>of this contract.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (OCT 2015)</HD>
                <P>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that—</P>
                <P>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals—</P>
                <P>(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</P>
                <P>(B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);</P>
                <P>(C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</P>
                <P>(D) Have □ , have not □ ,within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) <E T="03">The tax liability is finally determined.</E> The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) <E T="03">The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</E> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Examples. (<E T="03">i</E>) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<PRTPAGE P="54"/>
                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</P>
                <P>(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Principal,</E> for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</P>
                <P>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</P>
                <P>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</P>
                <P>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</P>
                <P>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</P>

The determinations are described in the <PRTPAGE P="58"/>most recent unclassified annual report provided to Congress pursuant to section 403 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 U.S.C. 2593a).

                <P>(c) Procedures for reviewing the annual unclassified report (see paragraph (b)(1) of this provision). For clarity, references to the report in this section refer to the entirety of the annual unclassified report, including any separate reports that are incorporated by reference into the annual unclassified report.</P>
                <P>(1) Check the table of contents of the annual unclassified report and the country section headings of the reports incorporated by reference to identify the foreign countries listed there. Determine whether the Offeror or any person owned or controlled by the Offeror may have engaged in any activity related to one or more of such foreign countries.</P>
                <P>(2) If there may have been such activity, review all findings in the report associated with those foreign countries to determine whether or not each such foreign country was determined to be in violation of its obligations undertaken in an arms control, nonproliferation, or disarmament agreement to which the United States is a party, or to be not adhering to its arms control, nonproliferation, or disarmament commitments in which the United States is a participating state. For clarity, in the annual report an explicit certification of non-compliance is equivalent to a determination of violation. However, the following statements in the annual report are not equivalent to a determination of violation:</P>
                <P>(i) An inability to certify compliance.</P>
                <P>(ii) An inability to conclude compliance.</P>
                <P>(iii) A statement about compliance concerns.</P>
                <P>(3) If so, determine whether the Offeror or any person owned or controlled by the Offeror has engaged in any activity that contributed to or is a significant factor in the determination in the report that one or more of these foreign countries is in violation of its obligations undertaken in an arms control, nonproliferation, or disarmament agreement to which the United States is a party, or is not adhering to its arms control, nonproliferation, or disarmament commitments in which the United States is a participating state. Review the narrative for any such findings reflecting a determination of violation or non-adherence related to those foreign countries in the report, including the finding itself, and to the extent necessary, the conduct giving rise to the compliance or adherence concerns, the analysis of compliance or adherence concerns, and efforts to resolve compliance or adherence concerns.</P>

                <P>(4) The Offeror may submit any questions with regard to this report by email to <E T="03">NDAA1290Cert@state.gov.</E> To the extent feasible, the Department of State will respond to such email inquiries within 3 business days.</P>
                <P>(d) Do not submit an offer unless—</P>
                <P>(1) A certification is provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this provision and submitted with the offer; or</P>
                <P>(2) In accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this provision, the Offeror provides with its offer information that the President of the United States has—</P>

However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically.

                </P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">The tax liability is finally determined.</E> The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</E> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples.</E> (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</P>
                <P>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</P>
                <P>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</P>
                <P>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</P>

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the “hourly rate” for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit.

                <P>(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or</P>
                <P>(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.</P>
                <P>(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.</P>
                <P>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.</P>
                <P>(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.</P>
                <P>(C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Other Costs.</E> Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Other Direct Costs.</E> The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (<E T="03">e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert “None” if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert “Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ‘None’”.</E>]</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.</E>). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [<E T="03">Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert “$0” if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert “Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ‘None’).”</E>]</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Total cost.</E> It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the <PRTPAGE P="83"/>Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Ceiling price.</E> The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Access to records.</E> At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):</P>
                <P>(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract;</P>
                <P>(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment—</P>
                <P>(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);</P>
                <P>(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;</P>
                <P>(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and</P>
                <P>(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.</P>
                <P>(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost—</P>
                <P>(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and</P>
                <P>(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Overpayments/Underpayments.</E> Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall—</P>
                <P>(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the—</P>
                <P>(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);</P>
                <P>(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;</P>
                <P>(C) Affected line item or subline item, if applicable; and</P>

                <P>(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Final Decisions.</E> The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if—</P>
                <P>(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;</P>
                <P>(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or</P>
                <P>(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2).</P>

                <P>(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall <PRTPAGE P="84"/>identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.</P>
                <P>(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:</P>
                <P>(A) The date fixed under this contract.</P>
                <P>(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.</P>
                <P>(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on—</P>
                <P>(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;</P>
                <P>(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or</P>
                <P>(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.</P>
                <P>(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the “completion invoice” and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Release of claim</E>s. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.</P>
                <P>(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.</P>
                <P>(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Prompt payment.</E> The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT</E>). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Discount.</E> In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Termination for the Government's convenience.</E> The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Termination for cause.</E> The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the “hourly rate” for labor hours expended in <PRTPAGE P="85"/>furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the “hourly rate” attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The Government will pay invoices based on the Contractor's delivery to a post office or common carrier (or, if shipped by other means, to the point of first receipt by the Government).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibility for supplies.</E> (1) Title to the supplies passes to the Government upon delivery to—</P>
                <P>(i) A post office or common carrier for shipment to the specific destination; or</P>

                <P>(ii) The point of first receipt by the Government, if shipment is by means other than Postal Service or common carrier.<PRTPAGE P="90"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of the contract, order, or blanket purchase agreement, the Contractor shall—</P>
                <P>(i) Assume all responsibility and risk of loss for supplies not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to purchase requirements; and</P>

                <P>(ii) Display prominently on the invoice “FAST PAY.” Invoices not prominently marked “FAST PAY” via manual or electronic means may be accepted by the payment office for fast payment.

                <P>(2) If the purchase price excludes the cost of transportation, the Contractor shall enter the prepaid shipping cost on the invoice as a separate item. The Contractor shall not include the cost of parcel post insurance. If transportation charges are stated separately on the invoice, the Contractor shall retain related paid freight bills or other transportation billings paid separately for a period of 3 years and shall furnish the bills to the Government upon request.</P>

                <P>(i) Ship-To Point.</P>

A bid may be withdrawn in person by a bidder or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of bids, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the bid.</P>

                <P>(e) The Government may reject a bid as nonresponsive if the prices bid are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. A bid is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated in relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt that the bid will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government even though it may be the low evaluated bid, or if it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.</P>

                <P>(a) This clause shall become operative only for any modification to this contract involving aggregate increases and/or decreases in costs, plus applicable profits, expected to exceed the threshold for the submission of certified cost or pricing data at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), except that this clause does not apply to a modification if an exception under FAR 15.403-1(b) applies.</P>
                <P>(b) If any price, including profit, negotiated in connection with any modification under this clause, was increased by any significant amount because (1) the Contractor or a subcontractor furnished certified cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, and current as certified in its Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, (2) a subcontractor or prospective subcontractor furnished the Contractor certified cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, and current as certified in the Contractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, or (3) any of these parties furnished data of any description that were not accurate, the price shall be reduced accordingly and the contract shall be modified to reflect the reduction. This right to a price reduction is limited to that resulting from defects in data relating to modifications for which this clause becomes operative under paragraph (a) of this clause.</P>

                <P>(c) Any reduction in the contract price under paragraph (b) of this clause due to defective data from a prospective subcontractor that was not subsequently awarded the subcontract shall be limited to the amount, plus applicable overhead and profit markup, by which (1) the actual subcontract or (2) the actual cost to the Contractor, if there was no subcontract, was less than the prospective subcontract cost estimate submitted by the Contractor; <E T="03">provided,</E> that the actual subcontract price was not itself affected by defective certified cost or pricing data.</P>
                <P>(d)(1) If the Contracting Officer determines under paragraph (b) of this clause that a price or cost reduction should be made, the Contractor agrees not to raise the following matters as a defense—</P>
                <P>(i) The Contractor or subcontractor was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a superior bargaining position and thus the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current certified cost or pricing data had been submitted;</P>
                <P>(ii) The Contracting Officer should have known that the certified cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the Contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the Contracting Officer;</P>
                <P>(iii) The contract was based on an agreement about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract; or</P>
                <P>(iv) The Contractor or subcontractor did not submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Except as prohibited by subdivision (d)(2)(ii) of this clause, an offset in an amount determined appropriate by the Contracting Officer based upon the facts shall be allowed against the amount of a contract price reduction if—</P>
                <P>(A) The Contractor certifies to the Contracting Officer that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, the Contractor is entitled to the offset in the amount requested; and</P>
                <P>(B) The Contractor proves that the certified cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) and that the data were not submitted before such date.</P>
                <P>(ii) An offset shall not be allowed if—</P>
                <P>(A) The understated data was known by the Contractor to be understated when the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data was signed; or</P>
                <P>(B) The Government proves that the facts demonstrate that the contract price would not have increased in the amount to be offset even if the available data had been submitted before the date of agreement on price.</P>
                <P>(e) If any reduction in the contract price under this clause reduces the price of items for which payment was made prior to the date of the modification reflecting the price reduction, the Contractor shall be liable to and shall pay the United States at the time such overpayment is repaid—</P>
                <P>(1) Interest compounded daily, as required by 26 U.S.C. 6622, on the amount of such overpayment to be computed from the date(s) of overpayment to the Contractor to the date the Government is repaid by the Contractor at the applicable underpayment rate effective for each quarter prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2); and</P>
                <P>(2) A penalty equal to the amount of the overpayment, if the Contractor or subcontractor knowingly submitted certified cost or pricing data which were incomplete, inaccurate, or noncurrent.</P>

                <P>(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision, received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—</P>

                <P>(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Restriction on disclosure and use of data.</E> Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall—</P>

                <P>(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed—in whole or in part—for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of—or in connection with—the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not <PRTPAGE P="105"/>limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and</P>
                <P>(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Contract award.</E> (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.</P>
                <P>(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest.</P>
                <P>(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.</P>
                <P>(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</P>
                <P>(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.</P>
                <P>(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.</P>
                <P>(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.</P>
                <P>(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</P>
                <P>(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.</P>
                <P>(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.</P>
                <P>(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:</P>
                <P>(i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer.</P>
                <P>(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.</P>
                <P>(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.</P>
                <P>(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.</P>
                <P>(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.</P>
                <P>(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.</P>

                <P>(c)(1) If the Contracting Officer determines under paragraph (a) of this clause that a price or cost reduction should be made, the Contractor agrees not to raise the following matters as a defense:</P>
                <P>(i) The Contractor or subcontractor was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a superior bargaining position and thus the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current certified cost or pricing data had been submitted.</P>

                <P>(3) There shall be no adjustment for any change in rates of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or unit prices for material which would not result in a net change of at least 3 percent of the then-current total contract price.

If at any time it appears that the then-current billing prices will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices, or if the Contractor submits data showing that the redetermined price will be substantially greater than the current billing prices, the parties shall negotiate an appropriate decrease or increase in billing prices. Any billing price adjustment shall be reflected in a contract modification and shall not affect the redetermination of prices under this clause. After the contract modification for price redetermination is executed, the total amount paid or to be paid on all invoices or vouchers shall be adjusted to reflect the agreed-upon prices, and any requested additional payments, refunds, or credits shall be made promptly.</P>

                <P>(iv) The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government (including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress payments).</P>
                <P>(2) The statement required by subparagraph (1) above need not be submitted for any quarter for which either no costs are to be reported under subdivision (1)(ii) above, or revised billing prices have been established in accordance with paragraph (g) above, and do not exceed the existing contract price, the Contractor's price-redetermination proposal, or a price based on the most recent quarterly statement, whichever is least.</P>
                <P>(3) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as computed in accordance with subdivisions (1)(i), (ii), and (iii) above, the Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the Contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the excess has been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress payment account, consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed reductions in refunds.</P>

                <P>(4) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in accordance with the Interest clause.<PRTPAGE P="122"/>

                <P>(i) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> No subcontract placed under this contract may provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Disagreements.</E> If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree upon redetermined prices for any price redetermination period within 60 days (or within such other period as the parties agree) after the date on which the data required by paragraph (d) above are to be submitted, the Contracting Officer shall promptly issue a decision in accordance with the Disputes clause. For the purpose of paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) above, and pending final settlement of the disagreement on appeal, by failure to appeal, or by agreement, this decision shall be treated as an executed contract modification. Pending final settlement, price redetermination for subsequent periods, if any, shall continue to be negotiated as provided in this clause.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Termination.</E> If this contract is terminated, prices shall continue to be established in accordance with this clause for (1) completed supplies and services accepted by the Government and (2) those supplies and services not terminated under a partial termination. All other elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance with other applicable clauses of this contract.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Predetermined Indirect Cost Rates (APR 1998)</HD>
                <P>(a) Notwithstanding the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract, the allowable indirect costs under this contract shall be obtained by applying predetermined indirect cost rates to bases agreed upon by the parties, as specified below.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) The Contractor shall submit an adequate final indirect cost rate proposal to the Contracting Officer (or cognizant Federal <PRTPAGE P="130"/>agency official) and auditor within the 6-month period following the expiration of each of its fiscal years. Reasonable extensions, for exceptional circumstances only, may be requested in writing by the Contractor and granted in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall support its proposal with adequate supporting data.</P>
                <P>(2) The proposed rates shall be based on the Contractor's actual cost experience for that period. The appropriate Government representative and the Contractor shall establish the final indirect cost rates as promptly as practical after receipt of the Contractor's proposal.</P>
                <P>(c) Allowability of costs and acceptability of cost allocation methods shall be determined in accordance with FAR subpart 31.3 in effect on the date of this contract.</P>
                <P>(d) Predetermined rate agreements in effect on the date of this contract shall be incorporated into the contract Schedule. The Contracting Officer (or cognizant Federal agency official) and Contractor shall negotiate rates for subsequent periods and execute a written indirect cost rate agreement setting forth the results. The agreement shall specify (1) the agreed-upon predetermined indirect cost rates, (2) the bases to which the rates apply, (3) the period for which the rates apply, and (4) the specific items treated as direct costs or any changes in the items previously agreed to be direct costs. The indirect cost rate agreement shall not change any monetary ceiling, contract obligation, or specific cost allowance or disallowance provided for in this contract. The agreement is incorporated into this contract upon execution.</P>
                <P>(e) Pending establishment of predetermined indirect cost rates for any fiscal year (or other period agreed to by the parties), the Contractor shall be reimbursed either at the rates fixed for the previous fiscal year (or other period) or at billing rates acceptable to the Contracting Officer (or cognizant Federal agency official), subject to appropriate adjustment when the final rates for that period are established.</P>
                <P>(f) Any failure by the parties to agree on any predetermined indirect cost rates under this clause shall not be considered a dispute within the meaning of the Disputes clause. If for any fiscal year (or other period specified in the Schedule) the parties fail to agree to predetermined indirect cost rates, the allowable indirect costs shall be obtained by applying final indirect cost rates established in accordance with the Allowable Cost and Payment clause.</P>
                <P>(g) Allowable indirect costs for the period from the beginning of performance until the end of the Contractor's fiscal year (or other period specified in the Schedule) shall be obtained using the predetermined indirect cost rates and the bases shown in the Schedule.</P>

                <P>(1) The parties may agree in writing, before the determination of total final price, to exclude specific elements of cost from this price and to a procedure for subsequent disposition of those elements; and</P>
                <P>(2) Adjustments or credits are explicitly permitted or required by this or any other clause in this contract.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Adjusting billing prices.</E> (1) Pending execution of the contract modification (see paragraph (e) above), the Contractor shall submit invoices or vouchers in accordance with billing prices as provided in this paragraph. The billing prices shall be the target prices shown in this contract.</P>
                <P>(2) If at any time it appears from information provided by the contractor under subparagraph (g)(2) below that the then-current billing prices will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices, the parties shall negotiate a reduction in the billing prices. Similarly, the parties may negotiate an increase in billing prices by any or all of the difference between the target prices and the ceiling price, upon the Contractor's submission of factual data showing that final cost under this contract will be substantially greater than the target cost.</P>
                <P>(3) Any billing price adjustment shall be reflected in a contract modification and shall not affect the determination of the total final price under paragraph (d) above. After the contract modification establishing the total final price is executed, the total amount paid or to be paid on all invoices or vouchers shall be adjusted to reflect the total final price, and any resulting additional payments, refunds, or credits shall be made promptly.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Quarterly limitation on payments statement.</E> This paragraph (g) shall apply until final price revision under this contract has been completed.</P>

                <P>(iv) The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government (including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress payments).</P>

                <P>(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as computed in accordance with subdivisions (1)(i), (ii), and (iii) above, the Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the Contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the <PRTPAGE P="132"/>excess has been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress payment account consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed reductions in refunds.</P>
                <P>(3) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in accordance with the Interest clause.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> No subcontract placed under this contract may provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Disagreements.</E> If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree upon the total final price within 60 days (or within such other period as the Contracting Officer may specify) after the date on which the data required by paragraph (c) above are to be submitted, the Contracting Officer shall promptly issue a decision in accordance with the Disputes clause.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Termination.</E> If this contract is terminated before the total final price is established, prices of supplies or services subject to price revision shall be established in accordance with this clause for (1) completed supplies and services accepted by the Government and (2) those supplies and services not terminated under a partial termination. All other elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance with other applicable clauses of this contract.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Equitable adjustment under other clauses.</E> If an equitable adjustment in the contract price is made under any other clause of this contract before the total final price is established, the adjustment shall be made in the total target cost and may be made in the maximum dollar limit on the total final price, the total target profit, or both. If the adjustment is made after the total final price is established, only the total final price shall be adjusted.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Exclusion from target price and total final price.</E> If any clause of this contract provides that the contract price does not or will not include an amount for a specific purpose, then neither any target price nor the total final price includes or will include any amount for that purpose.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Separate reimbursement.</E> If any clause of this contract expressly provides that the cost of performance of an obligation shall be at Government expense, that expense shall not be included in any target price or in the total final price, but shall be reimbursed separately.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Taxes.</E> As used in the Federal, State, and Local Taxes clause or in any other clause that provides for certain taxes or duties to be included in, or excluded from, the contract price, the term <E T="03">contract price</E> includes the total target price or, if it has been established, the total final price. When any of these clauses requires that the contract price be increased or decreased as a result of changes in the obligation of the Contractor to pay or bear the burden of certain taxes or duties, the increase or decrease shall be made in the total target price or, if it has been established, in the total final price, so that it will not affect the Contractor's profit or loss on this contract.</P>

                <P>(1) On the basis of the information required by paragraph (e) above, together with any other pertinent information, the parties shall negotiate the total final cost incurred or to be incurred for the supplies delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and which are subject to price revision under this clause.</P>
                <P>(2) The total final price shall be established by applying to the total final negotiated cost an adjustment for final profit or loss determined as agreed upon under subparagraph (d)(4) above.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Contract modification.</E> The total final price of the items specified in paragraph (a) above shall be evidenced by a modification to this contract, signed by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer. This price shall not be subject to revision, notwithstanding any changes in the cost of performing the contract, except to the extent that—</P>
                <P>(1) The parties may agree in writing, before the determination of total final price, to exclude specific elements of cost from this price and to a procedure for subsequent disposition of these elements; and</P>
                <P>(2) Adjustments or credits are explicitly permitted or required by this or any other clause in this contract.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Adjustment of billing prices.</E> (1) Pending execution of the contract modification (see paragraph (e) above), the Contractor shall submit invoices or vouchers in accordance with billing prices as provided in this paragraph. The billing prices shall be the initial target prices shown in this contract until firm target prices are established under paragraph (d) above. When established, the firm target prices shall be used as the billing prices.</P>
                <P>(2) If at any time it appears from information provided by the contractor under subparagraph (i)(1) below that the then-current billing prices will be substantially greater than the estimated final prices, the parties shall negotiate a reduction in the billing prices. Similarly, the parties may negotiate an increase in billing prices by any or all of the difference between the target prices and the ceiling price, upon the Contractor's submission of factual data showing that the final cost under this contract will be substantially greater than the target cost.</P>
                <P>(3) Any adjustment of billing prices shall be reflected in a contract modification and shall not affect the determination of any price under paragraph (d) or (f) above. After the contract modification establishing the total final price is executed, the total amount paid or to be paid on all invoices or vouchers shall be adjusted to reflect the total final price, and any resulting additional payments, refunds, or credits shall be made promptly.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Quarterly limitation on payments statement.</E> This paragraph (i) shall apply until a firm fixed price or a total final price is established under subparagraph (d)(3) or (f)(2).</P>
                <P>(1) Within 45 days after the end of each quarter of the Contractor's fiscal year in which a delivery is first made (or services are first performed) and accepted by the Government under this contract, and for each quarter thereafter, the Contractor shall submit to the contract administration office (with a copy to the contracting office and the cognizant contract auditor) a statement, cumulative from the beginning of the contract, showing—</P>
                <P>(i) The total contract price of all supplies delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices have been established;</P>
                <P>(ii) The total cost (estimated to the extent necessary) reasonably incurred for, and properly allocable solely to, the supplies delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices have not been established;</P>

                <P>(iii) The portion of the total interim profit (used in establishing the initial contract price or agreed to for the purpose of this paragraph (i)) that is in direct proportion to the supplies delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government and for which final prices have not been established—increased or decreased in accordance with subparagraph (d)(4) above when the amount stated under subdivision (ii), immediately above, differs from the aggregate <PRTPAGE P="135"/>firm target costs of the supplies or services; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The total amount of all invoices or vouchers for supplies delivered (or services performed) and accepted by the Government (including amounts applied or to be applied to liquidate progress payments).</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this contract authorizing greater payments, if on any quarterly statement the amount under subdivision (1)(iv) above exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as computed in accordance with subdivisions (1)(i), (ii), and (iii) above, the Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the Government the amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate, reduce this refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax credits due the Contractor under 26 U.S.C. 1481 and by the amount of previous refunds or credits effected under this clause. If any portion of the excess has been applied to the liquidation of progress payments, then that portion may, instead of being refunded, be added to the unliquidated progress payment account consistent with the Progress Payments clause. The Contractor shall provide complete details to support any claimed reductions in refunds.</P>
                <P>(3) If the Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 45 days after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that the Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30 days after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount of the excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in accordance with the Interest clause.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> No subcontract placed under this contract may provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Disagreements.</E> If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree upon (1) a total firm target cost and a final profit adjustment formula or (2) a total final price, within 60 days (or within such other period as the Contracting Officer may specify) after the date on which the data required in paragraphs (c) and (e) above are to be submitted, the Contracting Officer shall promptly issue a decision in accordance with the Disputes clause.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Termination.</E> If this contract is terminated before the total final price is established, prices of supplies or services subject to price revision shall be established in accordance with this clause for (1) completed supplies and services accepted by the Government and (2) those supplies or services not terminated under a partial termination. All other elements of the termination shall be resolved in accordance with other applicable clauses of this contract.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Equitable adjustments under other clauses.</E> If an equitable adjustment in the contract price is made under any other clause of this contract before the total final price is established, the adjustment shall be made in the total target cost and may be made in the maximum dollar limit on the total final price, the total target profit, or both. If the adjustment is made after the total final price is established, only the total final price shall be adjusted.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Exclusion from target price and total final price.</E> If any clause of this contract provides that the contract price does not or will not include an amount for a specific purpose, then neither any target price nor the total final price includes or will include any amount for that purpose.</P>
                <P>(o) <E T="03">Separate reimbursement.</E> If any clause of this contract expressly provides that the cost of performance of an obligation shall be at Government expense, that expense shall not be included in any target price or in the total final price, but shall be reimbursed separately.</P>
                <P>(p) <E T="03">Taxes.</E> As used in the Federal, State, and Local Taxes clause or in any other clause that provides for certain taxes or duties to be included in, or excluded from, the contract price, the term <E T="03">contract price</E> includes the total target price or, if it has been established, the total final price. When any of these clauses requires that the contract price be increased or decreased as a result of changes in the obligation of the Contractor to pay or bear the burden of certain taxes or duties, the increase or decrease shall be made in the total target price or, if it has been established, in the total final price, so that it will not affect the Contractor's profit or loss on this contract.</P>

Responding to a request for a quote does not constitute use in preparing a bid or proposal. The Offeror used a small business concern in preparing the bid or proposal if—<PRTPAGE P="155"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The Offeror identifies the small business concern as a subcontractor in the bid or proposal or associated small business subcontracting plan, to furnish certain supplies or perform a portion of the subcontract; or</P>

                <P>(13) Assurances that the Contractor will provide the Contracting Officer with a written explanation if the Contractor fails to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services or materials or obtain the performance of construction work as described in (d)(12) of this clause.

                <P>(14) Assurances that the Contractor will not prohibit a subcontractor from discussing with the Contracting Officer any material matter pertaining to payment to or utilization of a subcontractor.</P>
                <P>(15) Assurances that the offeror will pay its small business subcontractors on time and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the underlying subcontract, and notify the contracting officer when the prime contractor makes either a reduced or an untimely payment to a small business subcontractor (see 52.242-5).</P>
                <P>(e) In order to effectively implement this plan to the extent consistent with efficient contract performance, the Contractor shall perform the following functions:</P>
                <P>(1) Assist small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns by arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitate the participation by such concerns. Where the Contractor's lists of potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small business concerns an opportunity to compete over a period of time.</P>
                <P>(2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in all “make-or-buy” decisions.</P>
                <P>(3) Counsel and discuss subcontracting opportunities with representatives of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business firms.</P>
                <P>(4) Confirm that a subcontractor representing itself as a HUBZone small business concern is certified by SBA as a HUBZone small business concern in accordance with 52.219-8(d)(2).</P>
                <P>(5) Provide notice to subcontractors concerning penalties and remedies for misrepresentations of business status as small, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, or women-owned small business for the purpose of obtaining a subcontract that is to be included as part or all of a goal contained in the Contractor's subcontracting plan.</P>
                <P>(6) For all competitive subcontracts over the simplified acquisition threshold in which a small business concern received a small business preference, upon determination of the successful subcontract offeror, prior to award of the subcontract the Contractor must inform each unsuccessful small business subcontract offeror in writing of the name and location of the apparent successful offeror and if the successful subcontract offeror is a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concern.</P>
                <P>(7) Assign each subcontract the NAICS code and corresponding size standard that best describes the principal purpose of the subcontract.</P>
                <P>(f) A master subcontracting plan on a plant or division-wide basis that contains all the elements required by paragraph (d) of this clause, except goals, may be incorporated by reference as a part of the subcontracting plan required of the Offeror by this clause; provided—</P>
                <P>(1) The master subcontracting plan has been approved;</P>
                <P>(2) The Offeror ensures that the master subcontracting plan is updated as necessary and provides copies of the approved master subcontracting plan, including evidence of its approval, to the Contracting Officer; and</P>
                <P>(3) Goals and any deviations from the master subcontracting plan deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are set forth in the individual subcontracting plan.</P>

                <P>(g) A commercial plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. The commercial plan shall relate to the offeror's planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and Government business, rather than solely to the Government contract. Once the Contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government will not require another subcontracting plan from the same <PRTPAGE P="156"/>Contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the Contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial item. A Contractor with a commercial plan shall comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (d)(10) of this clause by submitting one SSR in eSRS for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. This report shall be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the Contracting Officer who approved the plan. This report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the Government's fiscal year.</P>
                <P>(h) Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.</P>
                <P>(i) A contract may have no more than one subcontracting plan. When a contract modification exceeds the subcontracting plan threshold in 19.702(a), or an option is exercised, the goals of the existing subcontracting plan shall be amended to reflect any new subcontracting opportunities. When the goals in a subcontracting plan are amended, these goal changes do not apply retroactively.</P>
                <P>(j) Subcontracting plans are not required from subcontractors when the prime contract contains the clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items, or when the subcontractor provides a commercial item subject to the clause at 52.244-6, Subcontracts for Commercial Items, under a prime contract.</P>
                <P>(k) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with (1) the clause of this contract entitled “Utilization Of Small Business Concerns,” or (2) an approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract and may be considered in any past performance evaluation of the Contractor.</P>

                <P>(l) The Contractor shall submit ISRs and SSRs using the web-based eSRS at <E T="03">http://www.esrs.gov.</E> Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the Contractor or subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract awards by affiliates shall be treated as subcontract awards by the Contractor. Subcontract award data reported by the Contractor and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards made to lower tier subcontractors, unless the Contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged business credit from an ANC or Indian tribe. Only subcontracts involving performance in the United States or its outlying areas should be included in these reports with the exception of subcontracts under a contract awarded by the State Department or any other agency that has statutory or regulatory authority to require subcontracting plans for subcontracts performed outside the United States and its outlying areas.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">ISR.</E> This report is not required for commercial plans. The report is required for each contract containing an individual subcontracting plan.</P>
                <P>(i) The report shall be submitted semi-annually during contract performance for the periods ending March 31 and September 30. A report is also required for each contract within 30 days of contract completion. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or the previous reporting period. When the Contracting Officer rejects an ISR, the Contractor shall submit a corrected report within 30 days of receiving the notice of ISR rejection.</P>
                <P>(ii)(A) When a subcontracting plan contains separate goals for the basic contract and each option, as prescribed by FAR 19.704(c), the dollar goal inserted on this report shall be the sum of the base period through the current option; for example, for a report submitted after the second option is exercised, the dollar goal would be the sum of the goals for the basic contract, the first option, and the second option.</P>
                <P>(B) If a subcontracting plan has been added to the contract pursuant to 19.702(a)(3) or 19.301-2(e), the Contractor's achievements must be reported in the ISR on a cumulative basis from the date of incorporation of the subcontracting plan into the contract.</P>
                <P>(iii) When a subcontracting plan includes indirect costs in the goals, these costs must be included in this report.</P>
                <P>(iv) The authority to acknowledge receipt or reject the ISR resides—</P>
                <P>(A) In the case of the prime Contractor, with the Contracting Officer; and</P>

                </P>
                <P>(C) If the Contractor or a subcontractor is performing work for more than one executive agency, a separate report shall be submitted to each executive agency covering only that agency's contracts, provided at least one of that agency's contracts is over $700,000 (over $1.5 million for construction of a public facility) and contains a subcontracting plan. For DoD, a consolidated report shall be submitted for all contracts awarded by military departments/agencies and/or subcontracts awarded by DoD prime contractors.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Construction Wage Rate Requirements (AUG 2018)</HD>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition</E>—<E T="03">Site of the work</E>—(1) Means—</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">The primary site of the work.</E> The physical place or places where the construction called for in the contract will remain when work on it is completed; and</P>

                <P>(A) Located in the United States; and</P>
                <P>(B) Established specifically for the performance of the contract or project;</P>
                <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this definition, includes any fabrication plants, mobile factories, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, tool yards, etc., provided—</P>
                <P>(i) They are dedicated exclusively, or nearly so, to performance of the contract or project; and</P>
                <P>(ii) They are adjacent or virtually adjacent to the “primary site of the work” as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i), or the “secondary site of the work” as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this definition;</P>
                <P>(3) Does not include permanent home offices, branch plant establishments, fabrication plants, or tool yards of a Contractor or subcontractor whose locations and continuance in operation are determined wholly without regard to a particular Federal contract or project. In addition, fabrication plants, batch plants, borrow pits, job headquarters, yards, etc., of a commercial or material supplier which are established by a supplier of materials for the project before opening of bids and not on the Project site, are not included in the “site of the work.” Such permanent, previously established facilities are not a part of the “site of the work” even if the operations for a period of time may be dedicated exclusively or nearly so, to the performance of a contract.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3)), the full amount of wages and bona fide fringe benefits (or cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not less than those contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part hereof, or as may be incorporated for a secondary site of the work, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and such laborers and mechanics. Any wage determination incorporated for a secondary site of the work shall be effective from the first day on which work under the contract was performed at that site and shall be incorporated without any adjustment in contract price or estimated cost. Laborers employed by the construction Contractor or construction subcontractor that are transporting portions of the building or work between the secondary site of the work and the primary site of the work shall be paid in accordance with the wage determination applicable to the primary site of the work.</P>
                <P>(2) Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits under section 1(b)(2) of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause; also, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less often than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such period.</P>
                <P>(3) Such laborers and mechanics shall be paid not less than the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits in the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, except as provided in the clause entitled Apprentices and Trainees. Laborers or mechanics performing work in more than one classification may be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked therein; provided that the employer's payroll records accurately set forth the time spent in each classification in which work is performed.</P>
                <P>(4) The wage determination (including any additional classifications and wage rates conformed under paragraph (c) of this clause) and the Construction Wage Rate Requirements (Davis-Bacon Act) poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at all times by the Contractor and its subcontractors at the primary site of the work and the secondary site of the work, if any, in a prominent and accessible place where it can be easily seen by the workers.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics, which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. The Contracting Officer shall approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits therefor only when all the following criteria have been met:</P>
                <P>(i) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a classification in the wage determination.</P>
                <P>(ii) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry.</P>
                <P>(iii) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination.</P>
                <P>(iv) With respect to helpers, such a classification prevails in the area in which the work is performed.</P>

                <P>(2) If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if known), or their representatives, and <PRTPAGE P="173"/>the Contracting Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), a report of the action taken shall be sent by the Contracting Officer to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210. The Administrator or an authorized representative will approve, modify, or disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.</P>
                <P>(3) In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification, or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the Contracting Officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of the Contracting Officer, to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for Determination. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.</P>
                <P>(4) The wage rate (including fringe benefits, where appropriate) determined pursuant to subparagraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this clause shall be paid to all workers performing work in the classification under this contract from the first day on which work is performed in the classification.</P>
                <P>(d) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof.</P>

                <P>(e) If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program; <E T="03">provided,</E> that the Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the Contractor, that the applicable standards of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the Contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Payrolls and Basic Records (AUG 2018)</HD>

                <P>(a) Payrolls and basic records relating thereto shall be maintained by the Contractor during the course of the work and preserved for a period of 3 years thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at the site of the work. Such records shall contain the name, address, and social security number of each such worker, his or her correct classification, hourly rates of wages paid (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits or cash equivalents thereof of the types described in 40 U.S.C. 3141(2)(B) (Construction Wage Rate Requirement statute)), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made, and actual wages paid. Whenever <PRTPAGE P="174"/>the Secretary of Labor has found, under paragraph (d) of the clause entitled Construction Wage Rate Requirements, that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in 40 U.S.C. 3141(2)(B), the Contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits. Contractors employing apprentices or trainees under approved programs shall maintain written evidence of the registration of apprenticeship programs and certification of trainee programs, the registration of the apprentices and trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) The Contractor shall submit weekly for each week in which any contract work is performed a copy of all payrolls to the Contracting Officer. The payrolls submitted shall set out accurately and completely all of the information required to be maintained under paragraph (a) of this clause, except that full social security numbers and home addresses shall not be included on weekly transmittals. Instead the payrolls shall only need to include an individually identifying number for each employee (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, the last four digits of the employee's social security number). The required weekly payroll information may be submitted in any form desired. Optional Form WH-347 is available for this purpose and may be obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division website at <E T="03">http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh347.pdf.</E> The Prime Contractor is responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls by all subcontractors. Contractors and subcontractors shall maintain the full social security number and current address of each covered worker, and shall provide them upon request to the Contracting Officer, the Contractor, or the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor for purposes of an investigation or audit of compliance with prevailing wage requirements. It is not a violation of this section for a Prime Contractor to require a subcontractor to provide addresses and social security numbers to the Prime Contractor for its own records, without weekly submission to the Contracting Officer.</P>

                <P>(2) Each payroll submitted shall be accompanied by a <E T="03">Statement of Compliance,</E> signed by the Contractor or subcontractor or his or her agent who pays or supervises the payment of the persons employed under the contract and shall certify—</P>
                <P>(i) That the payroll for the payroll period contains the information required to be maintained under paragraph (a) of this clause and that such information is correct and complete;</P>
                <P>(ii) That each laborer or mechanic (including each helper, apprentice, and trainee) employed on the contract during the payroll period has been paid the full weekly wages earned, without rebate, either directly or indirectly, and that no deductions have been made either directly or indirectly from the full wages earned, other than permissible deductions as set forth in the Regulations, 29 CFR part 3; and</P>
                <P>(iii) That each laborer or mechanic has been paid not less than the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits or cash equivalents for the classification of work performed, as specified in the applicable wage determination incorporated into the contract.</P>

                <P>(3) The weekly submission of a properly executed certification set forth on the reverse side of Optional Form WH-347 shall satisfy the requirement for submission of the <E T="03">Statement of Compliance</E> required by subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(4) The falsification of any of the certifications in this clause may subject the Contractor or subcontractor to civil or criminal prosecution under section 1001 of title 18 and section 3729 of title 31 of the United States Code.</P>
                <P>(c) The Contractor or subcontractor shall make the records required under paragraph (a) of this clause available for inspection, copying, or transcription by the Contracting Officer or authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor. The Contractor or subcontractor shall permit the Contracting Officer or representatives of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor to interview employees during working hours on the job. If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to submit required records or to make them available, the Contracting Officer may, after written notice to the Contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment. Furthermore, failure to submit the required records upon request or to make such records available may be grounds for debarment action pursuant to 29 CFR 5.12.</P>

                <P>(i) Pursuant to and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS) or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the OATELS; or</P>

                <P>(2) The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen on the job site in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to the entire work force under the registered program.</P>
                <P>(3) Any worker listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered or otherwise employed as stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, shall be paid not less than the applicable wage determination for the classification of work actually performed. In addition, any apprentice performing work on the job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the work actually performed.</P>
                <P>(4) Where a Contractor is performing construction on a project in a locality other than that in which its program is registered, the ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeyman's hourly rate) specified in the Contractor's or subcontractor's registered program shall be observed. Every apprentice must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the registered program for the apprentice's level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeyman hourly rate specified in the applicable wage determination.</P>
                <P>(5) Apprentices shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If the apprenticeship program does not specify fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid the full amount of fringe benefits listed on the wage determination for the applicable classification. If the Administrator determines that a different practice prevails for the applicable apprentice classification, fringes shall be paid in accordance with that determination.</P>
                <P>(6) In the event OATELS, or a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by OATELS, withdraws approval of an apprenticeship program, the Contractor will no longer be permitted to utilize apprentices at less than the applicable predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is approved.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Trainees.</E> (1) Except as provided in 29 CFR 5.16, trainees will not be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by formal certification by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS). The ratio of trainees to journeymen on the job site shall not be greater than permitted under the plan approved by OATELS.</P>
                <P>(2) Every trainee must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the approved program for the trainee's level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeyman hourly rate specified in the applicable wage determination. Trainees shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with the provisions of the trainee program. If the trainee program does not mention fringe benefits, trainees shall be paid the full amount of fringe benefits listed in the wage determination unless the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division determines that there is an apprenticeship program associated with the corresponding journeyman wage rate in the wage determination which provides for less than full fringe benefits for apprentices. Any employee listed on the payroll at a trainee rate who is not registered and participating in a training plan approved by the OATELS shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate in the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed. In addition, any trainee performing work on the job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate in the wage determination for the work actually performed.</P>

              <P>As prescribed in 22.1207, insert the following clause:</P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers (MAY 2014)</HD>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Service employee,</E> as used in this clause, means any person engaged in the performance of a service contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as those terms are defined in 29 CFR part 541. The term “service employee” includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a contractor or subcontractor and such persons.</P>

                <P>(b) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those service employees employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of <PRTPAGE P="178"/>award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the service employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which the service employees are qualified.</P>
                <P>(1) The Contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of service employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor Contractor employed in connection with performance of the work.</P>
                <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the Contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation.</P>
                <P>(i) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall make a bona fide express offer of employment to each service employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the service employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the service employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days.</P>
                <P>(ii) The successor Contractor and its subcontractors shall decide any question concerning a service employee's qualifications based upon the individual's education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee's experience on the predecessor contract, and the Contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with Executive Order 13495.</P>
                <P>(iii) Where the successor Contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractor's first date of performance on the contract.</P>
                <P>(iv) An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. (See 29 CFR 9.12 for a detailed description of a bonafide offer of employment).</P>
                <P>(c)(1) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (b) of this clause, the successor Contractor and any subcontractors (i) may employ under this contract any service employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (ii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, 41 U.S.C. 6701(3), and (iii) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any service employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the Contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job (see 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for additional information). The successor Contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of these exceptions.</P>

                <P>(2) In addition, any Contractor or subcontractor that has been certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration as a HUBZone small business concern must ensure that it complies with the statutory and regulatory requirements of the HUBZone Program (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> it must ensure that at least 35 percent of all of its employees reside within a HUBZone). The HUBZone small business Contractor or subcontractor must consider whether it can meet the requirements of this clause and Executive Order 13495 while also ensuring it meets the HUBZone Program's requirements.</P>
                <P>(3) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to permit a Contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law. For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see FAR subpart 19.13), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may conflict, in certain circumstances, with the requirements of Executive Order 13495. All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495, 29 CFR part 9, and this clause.</P>

                <P>(d)(1) The Contractor shall, not less than 30 days before completion of the Contractor's performance of services on the contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. Where changes to the workforce are made after the submission of the certified list described in this paragraph, the Contractor shall, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause, not less than 10 days before completion of the services on this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer with an updated certified list of the names of all service employees employed within the last month of contract performance. The updated list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment, and, <PRTPAGE P="179"/>where applicable, dates of separation of each service employee under the contract and its predecessor contracts with either the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors.</P>
                <P>(2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives.</P>
                <P>(3) The Contracting Officer will direct the predecessor Contractor to provide written notice (Appendix B to 29 CFR chapter 9) to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. Where a significant portion of the predecessor Contractor's workforce is not fluent in English, the notice shall be provided in English and the language(s) with which service employees are more familiar. The written notice shall be—</P>
                <P>(i) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such delivery is via email, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice.</P>
                <P>(e)(1) If required in accordance with 52.222-41(n), the predecessor Contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor Contractors or their subcontractors. If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor Contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of 52.222-41(n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor Contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than 10 days prior to performance completion.</P>
                <P>(2) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives.</P>

                <P>(f) The Contractor and subcontractor shall maintain the following records (regardless of format, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> paper or electronic) of its compliance with this clause for not less than a period of three years from the date the records were created.</P>
                <P>(1) Copies of any written offers of employment or a contemporaneous written record of any oral offers of employment, including the date, location, and attendance roster of any service employee meeting(s) at which the offers were extended, a summary of each meeting, a copy of any written notice that may have been distributed, and the names of the service employees from the predecessor contract to whom an offer was made.</P>
                <P>(2) A copy of any record that forms the basis for any exemption claimed under this part.</P>
                <P>(3) A copy of the service employee list provided to or received from the contracting agency.</P>
                <P>(4) An entry on the pay records of the amount of any retroactive payment of wages or compensation under the supervision of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to each service employee, the period covered by such payment, and the date of payment, and a copy of any receipt form provided by or authorized by the Wage and Hour Division. The Contractor shall also deliver a copy of the receipt to the service employee and file the original, as evidence of payment by the Contractor and receipt by the service employee, with the Administrator or an authorized representative within 10 days after payment is made.</P>

                <P>(g) Disputes concerning the requirements of this clause shall not be subject to the general disputes clause (52.233-1) of this contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 9. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between or among any of the following: The Contractor, the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the service employees under the contract or its predecessor contract. The Contracting Officer will refer any service employee who wishes to file a complaint, or ask questions concerning this contract clause, to the: Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. Contact email: <E T="03">displaced@dol.gov.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(h) The Contractor shall cooperate in any review or investigation by the Department of Labor into possible violations of the provisions of this clause and shall make such records requested by such official(s) available for inspection, copying, or transcription upon request.</P>

                <P>(i) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the Contractor or its subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked <PRTPAGE P="180"/>against the Contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order 13495, the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law.</P>
                <P>(j) The Contractor shall take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance. However, if the Contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the Contractor may request that the United States, through the Secretary, enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.</P>
                <P>(k) The Contracting Officer will withhold, or cause to be withheld, from the prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the same prime Contractor, such sums as an authorized official of the Department of Labor requests, upon a determination by the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, that there has been a failure to comply with the terms of this clause and that wages lost as a result of the violations are due to service employees or that other monetary relief is appropriate. If the Contracting Officer or the Administrator, upon final order of the Secretary, finds that the Contractor has failed to provide a list of the names of service employees working under the contract, the Contracting Officer may, in his or her discretion, or upon request by the Administrator, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of the payment of contract funds until such time as the list is provided to the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> In every subcontract over the simplified acquisition threshold entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the Contractor shall include a provision that ensures—</P>
                <P>(1) That each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (c) of this clause with respect to the service employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor Contractor and its subcontractors;</P>
                <P>(2) That the subcontractor will provide the Contractor with the information about the service employees of the subcontractor needed by the Contractor to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause; and</P>
                <P>(3) The recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (f) of this clause.</P>

                <P>(b) If the Contractor, or a subcontractor at any tier, subcontracts a portion of the work involving any construction trade, each such subcontract in excess of $10,000 shall include this clause and the Notice containing the goals for minority and female participation stated in the solicitation for this contract.</P>
                <P>(c) If the Contractor is participating in a Hometown Plan (41 CFR 60-4) approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in a covered area, either individually or through an association, its affirmative action obligations on all work in the plan area (including goals) shall comply with the plan for those trades that have unions participating in the plan. Contractors must be able to demonstrate participation in, and compliance with, the provisions of the plan. Each Contractor or subcontractor participating in an approved plan is also required to comply with its obligations under the Equal Opportunity clause, and to make a good faith effort to achieve each goal under the plan in each trade in which it has employees. The overall good-faith performance by other Contractors or subcontractors toward a goal in an approved plan does not excuse any Contractor's or subcontractor's failure to make good-faith efforts to achieve the plan's goals.</P>
                <P>(d) The Contractor shall implement the affirmative action procedures in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause. The goals stated in the solicitation for this contract are expressed as percentages of the total hours of employment and training of minority and female utilization that the Contractor should reasonably be able to achieve in each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area. If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area located outside of the covered area, it shall apply the goals established for the geographical area where that work is actually performed. The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform progress toward its goals in each craft.</P>
                <P>(e) Neither the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer minorities or women shall excuse the Contractor's obligations under this clause, Executive Order 11246, as amended, or the regulations thereunder.</P>
                <P>(f) In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, apprentices and trainees must be employed by the Contractor during the training period, and the Contractor must have made a commitment to employ the apprentices and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the availability of employment opportunities. Trainees must be trained pursuant to training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor.</P>
                <P>(g) The Contractor shall take affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunity. The evaluation of the Contractor's compliance with this clause shall be based upon its effort to achieve maximum results from its actions. The Contractor shall document these efforts fully and implement affirmative action steps at least as extensive as the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Ensure a working environment free of harassment, intimidation, and coercion at all sites and in all facilities where the Contractor's employees are assigned to work. The Contractor, if possible, will assign two or more women to each construction project. The Contractor shall ensure that foremen, superintendents, and other onsite supervisory personnel are aware of and carry out the Contractor's obligation to maintain such a working environment, with specific attention to minority or female individuals working at these sites or facilities.</P>
                <P>(2) Establish and maintain a current list of sources for minority and female recruitment. Provide written notification to minority and female recruitment sources and community organizations when the Contractor or its unions have employment opportunities available, and maintain a record of the organizations' responses.</P>
                <P>(3) Establish and maintain a current file of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of each minority and female off-the-street applicant, referrals of minorities or females from unions, recruitment sources, or community organizations, and the action taken with respect to each individual. If an individual was sent to the union hiring hall for referral and not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if referred back, not employed by the Contractor, this shall be documented in the file, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may have taken.</P>
                <P>(4) Immediately notify the Deputy Assistant Secretary when the union or unions with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement has not referred back to the Contractor a minority or woman sent by the Contractor, or when the Contractor has other information that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts to meet its obligations.</P>

                <P>(5) Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the area that expressly include minorities and women, including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to the Contractor's employment needs, especially those programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor. The Contractor shall provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause.<PRTPAGE P="187"/>
                </P>
                <P>(6) Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy by—</P>
                <P>(i) Providing notice of the policy to unions and to training, recruitment, and outreach programs, and requesting their cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting its contract obligations;</P>
                <P>(ii) Including the policy in any policy manual and in collective bargaining agreements;</P>
                <P>(iii) Publicizing the policy in the company newspaper, annual report, etc.;</P>
                <P>(iv) Reviewing the policy with all management personnel and with all minority and female employees at least once a year; and</P>
                <P>(v) Posting the policy on bulletin boards accessible to employees at each location where construction work is performed.</P>
                <P>(7) Review, at least annually, the Contractor's equal employment policy and affirmative action obligations with all employees having responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff, termination, or other employment decisions. Conduct review of this policy with all on-site supervisory personnel before initiating construction work at a job site. A written record shall be made and maintained identifying the time and place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed, and disposition of the subject matter.</P>
                <P>(8) Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy externally by including it in any advertising in the news media, specifically including minority and female news media. Provide written notification to, and discuss this policy with, other Contractors and subcontractors with which the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.</P>
                <P>(9) Direct recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to minority, female, and community organizations, to schools with minority and female students, and to minority and female recruitment and training organizations serving the Contractor's recruitment area and employment needs. Not later than 1 month before the date for acceptance of applications for apprenticeship or training by any recruitment source, send written notification to organizations such as the above, describing the openings, screening procedures, and tests to be used in the selection process.</P>
                <P>(10) Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit minority persons and women. Where reasonable, provide after-school, summer, and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the site and in other areas of the Contractor's workforce.</P>
                <P>(11) Validate all tests and other selection requirements where required under 41 CFR 60-3.</P>
                <P>(12) Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least of all minority and female personnel for promotional opportunities. Encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, through appropriate training, etc., opportunities for promotion.</P>
                <P>(13) Ensure that seniority practices, job classifications, work assignments, and other personnel practices, do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment-related activities to ensure that the Contractor's obligations under this contract are being carried out.</P>
                <P>(14) Ensure that all facilities and company activities are nonsegregated except that separate or single-user rest rooms and necessary dressing or sleeping areas shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes.</P>
                <P>(15) Maintain a record of solicitations for subcontracts for minority and female construction contractors and suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor associations and other business associations.</P>
                <P>(16) Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors' adherence to and performance under the Contractor's equal employment policy and affirmative action obligations.</P>
                <P>(h) The Contractor is encouraged to participate in voluntary associations that may assist in fulfilling one or more of the affirmative action obligations contained in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause. The efforts of a contractor association, joint contractor-union, contractor-community, or similar group of which the contractor is a member and participant may be asserted as fulfilling one or more of its obligations under subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause, provided the Contractor—</P>
                <P>(1) Actively participates in the group;</P>
                <P>(2) Makes every effort to ensure that the group has a positive impact on the employment of minorities and women in the industry;</P>
                <P>(3) Ensures that concrete benefits of the program are reflected in the Contractor's minority and female workforce participation;</P>
                <P>(4) Makes a good-faith effort to meet its individual goals and timetables; and</P>
                <P>(5) Can provide access to documentation that demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the Contractor. The obligation to comply is the Contractor's, and failure of such a group to fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's noncompliance.</P>
                <P>(i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women shall be established. The Contractor is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups, both male and female, and all women, both minority and nonminority. Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive Order 11246, as amended, if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner.</P>

                <P>(j) The Contractor shall not use goals or affirmative action standards to discriminate <PRTPAGE P="188"/>against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.</P>
                <P>(k) The Contractor shall not enter into any subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts under Executive Order 11246, as amended.</P>
                <P>(l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of this clause and of the Equal Opportunity clause, including suspension, termination, and cancellation of existing subcontracts, as may be imposed or ordered under Executive Order 11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the OFCCP. Any failure to carry out these sanctions and penalties as ordered shall be a violation of this clause and Executive Order 11246, as amended.</P>
                <P>(m) The Contractor in fulfilling its obligations under this clause shall implement affirmative action procedures at least as extensive as those prescribed in paragraph (g) of this clause, so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended, the implementing regulations, or this clause, the Deputy Assistant Secretary shall take action as prescribed in 41 CFR 60-4.8.</P>
                <P>(n) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to—</P>
                <P>(1) Monitor all employment-related activity to ensure that the Contractor's equal employment policy is being carried out;</P>
                <P>(2) Submit reports as may be required by the Government; and</P>

                <P>(3) Keep records that shall at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone number, construction trade, union affiliation (if any), employee identification number, social security number, race, sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in status, hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. Records shall be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form; <E T="03">however,</E> to the degree that existing records satisfy this requirement, separate records are not required to be maintained.</P>
                <P>(o) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a limitation upon the application of other laws that establish different standards of compliance or upon the requirements for the hiring of local or other area residents (e.g., those under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).</P>

              <P>As prescribed in 22.407(g), insert the following clause:</P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Construction Wage Rate Requirements—Price Adjustment (Actual Method) (AUG 2018)</HD>
                <P>(a) The wage determination issued under the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, that is effective for an option to extend the term of the contract, will apply to that option period.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) The Contractor states that if the prices in this contract contain an allowance for wage or benefit increases, such allowance will not be included in any request for contract price adjustment submitted under this clause.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor shall provide with each request for contract price adjustment under this clause a statement that the prices in the contract do not include any allowance for any increased cost for which adjustment is being requested.</P>
                <P>(c) The Contracting Officer will adjust the contract price or contract unit price labor rates to reflect the Contractor's actual increase or decrease in wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is made to comply with, or the decrease is voluntarily made by the Contractor as a result of—</P>
                <P>(1) Incorporation of the Department of Labor's Construction Wage Rate Requirements wage determination applicable at the exercise of an option to extend the term of the contract; or</P>

                <P>(2) Incorporation of a Construction Wage Rate Requirements wage determination otherwise applied to the contract by operation of law.<PRTPAGE P="190"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (c) of this clause, and the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but will not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.</P>
                <P>(e) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a revised wage determination unless this notification period is extended in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer promptly of any decrease under this clause, but nothing in this clause precludes the Government from asserting a claim within the period permitted by law. The notice shall contain a statement of the amount claimed and any relevant supporting data, including payroll records that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require. Upon agreement of the parties, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract price or contract unit price in writing. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and its effective date.</P>
                <P>(f) Contract price adjustment computations shall be computed as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Computation for contract unit price per single craft hour for schedule of indefinite-quantity work.</E> For each labor classification, the difference between the actual wage and benefit rates (combined) paid and the wage and benefit rates (combined) required by the new wage determination shall be added to the original contract unit price if the difference results in a combined increase. If the difference computed results in a combined decrease, the contract unit price shall be decreased by that amount if the Contractor provides notification as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Computation for contract unit price containing multiple craft hours for schedule of indefinite-quantity work.</E> For each labor classification, the difference between the actual wage and benefit rates (combined) paid and the wage and benefit rates (combined) required by the new wage determination shall be multiplied by the actual number of hours expended for each craft involved in accomplishing the unit-priced work item. The product of this computation will then be divided by the actual number of units ordered in the preceding contract period. The total of these computations for each craft will be added to the current contract unit price to obtain the new contract unit price. The extended amount for the line item will be obtained by multiplying the new unit price by the estimated quantity. If actual hours are not available from the preceding contract period for computation of the adjustment for a specific contract unit of work, the Contractor, in agreement with the Contracting Officer, shall estimate the total hours per craft per contract unit of work.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Service Contract Labor Standards (AUG 2018)</HD>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this clause—</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Contractor</E> when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term “Government Prime Contractor.”</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Service employee</E> means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in part 541 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of 41 U.S.C. chapter 67, Service Contract Labor Standards, and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 6702, as interpreted in subpart C of 29 CFR part 4.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Compensation.</E> (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract.</P>

                <P>(2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c).<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary.</P>
                <P>(iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination.</P>
                <P>(iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed.</P>
                <P>(B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed.</P>
                <P>(C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.</P>
                <P>(v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and this contract.</P>
                <P>(vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Adjustment of Compensation.</E> If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Obligation to Furnish Fringe Benefits.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with subpart D of 29 CFR part 4.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Minimum Wage.</E> In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service <PRTPAGE P="196"/>employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Successor Contracts.</E> If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Notification to Employees.</E> The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of 41 U.S.C. 6703 and of this contract.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Safe and Sanitary Working Conditions.</E> The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR part 1925.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Records.</E> (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, a record of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) For each employee subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute—</P>
                <P>(A) Name and address and social security number;</P>
                <P>(B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation;</P>
                <P>(C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and</P>
                <P>(D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee.</P>
                <P>(ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement.</P>

                <P>(iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause.<PRTPAGE P="197"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division.</P>
                <P>(3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Pay Periods.</E> The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or Regulations, 29 CFR part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this statute may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Withholding of Payments and Termination of Contract.</E> The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Collective Bargaining Agreements Applicable to Service Employees.</E> If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Seniority List.</E> Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names, of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract.</P>
                <P>(o) <E T="03">Rulings and Interpretations.</E> Rulings and interpretations of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR part 4.</P>
                <P>(p) <E T="03">Contractor's Certification.</E> (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under 41 U.S.C. 6706.</P>
                <P>(2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under 41 U.S.C. 6706.</P>

                <P>(q) <E T="03">Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions Involving Employment.</E> Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees <PRTPAGE P="198"/>may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 6707 prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business.</P>
                <P>(1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by 41 U.S.C. 6703(1) without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under 41 U.S.C. 6703(2), in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, persons with disabilities, and disabled clients of work centers under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).</P>
                <P>(2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the statute for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, persons with disabilities, or disabled clients of work centers not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two statutes, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).</P>
                <P>(3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528.</P>
                <P>(r) <E T="03">Apprentices.</E> Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship and Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program.</P>
                <P>(s) <E T="03">Tips.</E> An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by 41 U.S.C. 6703(1), in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations 29 CFR part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January l, 1981. To use this provision—</P>
                <P>(1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized;</P>
                <P>(2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received);</P>
                <P>(3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Labor Standards minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and</P>
                <P>(4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of 41 U.S.C. 6707(c).</P>
                <P>(t) <E T="03">Disputes Concerning Labor Standards.</E> The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives.</P>

If no such determination has been made applicable to this contract, then the Federal minimum wage as established by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 206) current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees (FEB 1993)</HD>
                <P>(a) Recompetition of service contracts may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished professional employees. This lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance. It is therefore in the Government's best interest that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and fairly compensated. As a part of their proposals, offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it reflects a sound management approach and understanding of the contract requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted high-quality work. The professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact upon recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure.</P>

                <P>(b) The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear understanding of work to be performed and should indicate the capability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must take into account differences in skills, the complexity of various disciplines, and professional job difficulty. Additionally, proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional service employees. <PRTPAGE P="201"/>Offerors are cautioned that lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement.</P>
                <P>(c) The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. Professional compensation that is unrealistically low or not in reasonable relationship to the various job categories, since it may impair the Contractor's ability to attract and retain competent professional service employees, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements.</P>
                <P>(d) Failure to comply with these provisions may constitute sufficient cause to justify rejection of a proposal.</P>

                <P>(3)(i) The Contractor may request a price adjustment only after the effective date of the new annual E.O. minimum wage determination. Prices will be adjusted only for increased labor costs (including subcontractor labor costs) as a result of an increase in the annual E.O. minimum wage, and for associated labor costs (including those for subcontractors). Associated labor costs shall include increases or decreases that result from changes in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but will not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.</P>

Workers shall <PRTPAGE P="211"/>be paid no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which such wages were earned or accrued.</P>
                <P>(6) The Contractor shall pay, unconditionally to each worker, all wages due free and clear without subsequent rebate or kickback. The Contractor may make deductions that reduce a worker's wages below the E.O. minimum wage rate only if done in accordance with 29 CFR 10.23, Deductions.</P>
                <P>(7) The Contractor shall not discharge any part of its minimum wage obligation under this clause by furnishing fringe benefits or, with respect to workers whose wages are governed by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the cash equivalent thereof.</P>
                <P>(8) Nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from compliance with any applicable Federal or State prevailing wage law or any applicable law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the E.O. minimum wage. However, wage increases under such other laws or municipal ordinances are not subject to price adjustment under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(9) The Contractor shall pay the E.O. minimum wage rate whenever it is higher than any applicable collective bargaining agreement(s) wage rate.</P>
                <P>(10) The Contractor shall follow the policies and procedures in 29 CFR 10.24(b) and 10.28 for treatment of workers engaged in an occupation in which they customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips.</P>

With respect to workers whose wages are governed by the FLSA, the Contractor shall post notice, utilizing the poster provided by the Administrator, which can be obtained at <E T="03">www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts,</E> in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite.

                <P>(4) Failure to comply with this paragraph (e) shall be a violation of 29 CFR 10.26 and this contract. Upon direction of the Administrator or upon the Contracting Officer's own <PRTPAGE P="212"/>action, payment shall be withheld until such time as the noncompliance is corrected.</P>
                <P>(5) Nothing in this clause limits or otherwise modifies the Contractor's payroll and recordkeeping obligations, if any, under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act, or any other applicable law.</P>

                <P>(i) <E T="03">Antiretaliation.</E> The Contractor shall not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any worker because such worker has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to compliance with the E.O. or this clause, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Subcontractor compliance.</E> The Contractor is responsible for subcontractor compliance with the requirements of this clause and may be held liable for unpaid wages due subcontractor workers.</P>

                <P>(ii) The employee's occupation(s) or classification(s).</P>
                <P>(iii) The rate or rates of wages paid (including all pay and benefits provided).</P>
                <P>(iv) The number of daily and weekly hours worked.</P>

                <P>(x) A copy of any written responses to employees' requests to use paid sick leave, including explanations for any denials of such requests, as required under 29 CFR 13.5(d)(3).</P>

                <P>(xii) Any other records showing any tracking of or calculations related to an employee's accrual or use of paid sick leave.</P>
                <P>(xiii) The relevant contract.</P>
                <P>(xiv) The regular pay and benefits provided to an employee for each use of paid sick leave.</P>

                <P>(2)(i) If the Contractor wishes to distinguish between an employee's covered and noncovered work, the Contractor shall keep records or other proof reflecting such distinctions. Only if the Contractor adequately segregates the employee's time will time spent on noncovered work be excluded from hours worked counted toward the accrual of paid sick leave. Similarly, only if the Contractor adequately segregates the employee's time may the Contractor properly refuse an employee's request to use paid sick leave on the ground that the employee was scheduled to perform noncovered work during the time he or she asked to use paid sick leave.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the Contractor estimates covered hours worked by an employee who performs work in connection with contracts covered by the E.O. pursuant to 29 CFR 13.5(a)(1)(i) or (iii), the Contractor shall keep records or other proof of the verifiable information on which such estimates are reasonably based. Only if the Contractor relies on an estimate that is reasonable and based on verifiable information will an employee's time spent in connection with noncovered work be excluded from hours worked counted toward the accrual of paid sick leave. If the Contractor estimates the amount of time an employee spends performing in connection with contracts covered by the E.O., the Contractor shall permit the employee to use his or her paid sick leave during any work time for the Contractor.</P>

                <P>(iv) Reducing an employee's accrued paid sick leave by more than the amount of such leave used;</P>
                <P>(v) Transferring an employee to work on contracts not covered by the E.O. to prevent the accrual or use of paid sick leave;</P>

Contractors that customarily post notices to employees electronically may post the notice electronically, provided such electronic posting is displayed prominently on any Web site that is maintained by the Contractor, whether external or internal, and customarily used for notices to employees about terms and conditions of employment.</P>

                <P>(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which nonavailability determinations have been made are treated as domestic; or</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Domestic preference.</E> (1) This clause implements 41 U.S.C. chapter 83, Buy American, by providing a preference for domestic construction material. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, the component test of the Buy American statute is waived for construction material that is a COTS item. (See FAR 12.505(a)(2)). The Contractor shall use only <PRTPAGE P="237"/>domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(2) This requirement does not apply to information technology that is a commercial item or to the construction materials or components listed by the Government as follows:</P>

                <P>(i) The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American statute is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent;</P>
                <P>(ii) The application of the restriction of the Buy American statute to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American statute.</E> (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including—</P>

                <P>(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued).</P>
                <P>(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American statute applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American statute applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American statute or Balance of Payments Program.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Data.</E> To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluation of offers.</E> (1) The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy American statute, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic construction material, by adding to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9.</P>
                <P>(2) If evaluation results in a tie between an offeror that requested the substitution of foreign construction material based on unreasonable cost and an offeror that did not request an exception, the Contracting Officer will award to the offeror that did not request an exception based on unreasonable cost.</P>

                <P>(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those offers based on use of the equivalent domestic construction material, and the offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which an exception was requested—</P>

If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or the Buy American statute.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Data.</E> To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:<PRTPAGE P="249"/>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests for determinations of inapplicability.</E> An offeror requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) or the Buy American statute should submit the request to the Contracting Officer in time to allow a determination before submission of offers. The offeror shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-21 in the request. If an offeror has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute before submitting its offer, or has not received a response to a previous request, the offeror shall include the information and supporting data in the offer.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluation of offers.</E> (1) If the Government determines that an exception based on unreasonable cost of domestic construction material applies in accordance with FAR 25.604, the Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute by adding to the offered price of the contract—</P>
                <P>(i) 25 percent of the offered price of the contract, if foreign manufactured construction material is incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable manufactured domestic construction material; and</P>
                <P>(ii) 6 percent of the cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material included in the offer based on an exception for the unreasonable cost of comparable domestic unmanufactured construction material.</P>
                <P>(2) If the solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition to cost or price, the Contracting Officer will apply the evaluation factors as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this provision and use the evaluated price in determining the offer that represents the best value to the Government.</P>
                <P>(3) Unless paragraph (c)(2) of this provision applies, if two or more offers are equal in price, the Contracting Officer will give preference to an offer that does not include foreign construction material excepted at the request of the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost of comparable domestic construction material.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternate offers.</E> (1) When an offer includes foreign construction material not listed by the Government in this solicitation in paragraph (b)(3) of the clause at FAR 52.225-21, the offeror also may submit an alternate offer based on use of equivalent domestic construction material.</P>
                <P>(2) If an alternate offer is submitted, the offeror shall submit a separate Standard Form 1442 for the alternate offer and a separate cost comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-21 for the offer that is based on the use of any foreign construction material for which the Government has not yet determined an exception applies.</P>

                <P>(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR 52.225-21 does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those offers based on use of the <PRTPAGE P="250"/>equivalent domestic construction material, and the offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which an exception was requested—</P>
                <P>(i) Will be rejected as nonresponsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or</P>
                <P>(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.</P>

                  <E T="03">Subject invention</E> means any invention of the Contractor made in the performance of work under this contract.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Contractor's rights</E> (1) <E T="03">Ownership.</E> The Contractor may retain ownership of each subject invention throughout the world in accordance with the provisions of this clause.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">License.</E> (i) The Contractor shall retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. The Contractor's license extends to any domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part, and includes the right to grant sublicenses to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at contract award. The license is transferable only with the written approval of the agency, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Contractor's license may be revoked or modified by the agency to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention in a particular country in accordance with the procedures in FAR 27.302(i)(2) and 27.304-1(f).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Contractor's obligations.</E> (1) The Contractor shall disclose in writing each subject invention to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure shall identify the inventor(s) and this contract under which the subject invention was made. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding of the subject invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, sale or offer for sale), or public use of the subject invention, or whether a manuscript describing the subject invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication. In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the subject invention for publication and any on sale or public use.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain ownership of any subject invention by notifying the Contracting Officer within 2 years of disclosure to the agency. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.</P>
                <P>(3) The Contractor shall file either a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application or a Plant Variety Protection Application on an elected subject invention within 1 year after election. However, in any case where a publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the Contractor shall file the application prior to the end of that statutory period. If the Contractor files a provisional application, it shall file a nonprovisional application within 10 months of the filing of the provisional application. The Contractor shall file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either 10 months of the first filed patent application (whether provisional or nonprovisional) or 6 months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor may request extensions of time for disclosure, election, or filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this clause.</P>

                <P>(i) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect ownership to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain ownership; provided, that the agency may request title only within 60 days after learning of the Contractor's failure to disclose or elect within the specified times.</P>
                <P>(ii) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain ownership in that country.</P>

                <P>(iii) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination <PRTPAGE P="265"/>or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">License.</E> If the Contractor retains ownership of any subject invention, the Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on its behalf, the subject invention throughout the world.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Contractor action to protect the Government's interest.</E> (1) The Contractor shall execute or have executed and promptly deliver to the agency all instruments necessary to—</P>
                <P>(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions in which the Contractor elects to retain ownership; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Assign title to the agency when requested under paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection and plant variety protection for that subject invention in any country.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor shall require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in the Contractor's format, each subject invention in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. The disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</P>
                <P>(3) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any decisions not to file a nonprovisional patent application, continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response or filing period required by the relevant patent office.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor shall include, within the specification of any United States nonprovisional patent or plant variety protection application and any patent or plant variety protection certificate issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the agency). The Government has certain rights in the invention.”</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.</E> The Contractor shall submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining utilization of the subject invention that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. The reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also shall provide additional reports as may be requested by the agency in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the agency in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. The Contractor also shall mark any utilization report as confidential/proprietary to help prevent inadvertent release outside the Government. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the agency will not disclose that information to persons outside the Government without the Contractor's permission.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Preference for United States industry.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless the person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for an agreement may be waived by the agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States, or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">March-in rights.</E> The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has retained ownership, the agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the agency in effect on the date of contract award.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations.</E> If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it shall—</P>

                <P>(1) Not assign rights to a subject invention in the United States without the written approval of the agency, except where an assignment is made to an organization that has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, <E T="03">provided</E>, that the assignee shall be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;</P>

                <P>(2) Share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (but through <PRTPAGE P="266"/>their agency if the agency deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;</P>
                <P>(3) Use the balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions for the support of scientific research or education; and</P>

                <P>(4) Make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business concerns, and give a preference to a small business concern when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business concern has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business concerns; <E T="03">provided</E>, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business concern has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(5) Allow the Secretary of Commerce to review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Communications.</E> [<E T="03">Complete according to agency instructions.</E>]</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> (1) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (k), in all subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small business concern or nonprofit organization.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor shall include in all other subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work the substance of the patent rights clause required by FAR Subpart 27.3.</P>
                <P>(3) At all tiers, the patent rights clause must be modified to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause. The Contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.</P>
                <P>(4) In subcontracts, at any tier, the agency, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the agency with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes statute in connection with proceedings under paragraph (h) of this clause.</P>

                <P>(3) When the Government elects not to apply for a patent in any foreign country, the Contractor retains rights in that foreign country to apply for a patent, subject to the Government's rights in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Invention identification, disclosures, and reports.</E> (1) The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to educate its employees in order to assure that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of subject inventions, and records that show the procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of these procedures for evaluation and for a determination as to their effectiveness.</P>

                <P>(2) The Contractor shall disclose in writing each subject invention to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters or, if earlier, within 6 months after the Contractor becomes aware that a subject invention has been made, but in any event before any on sale (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, sale or offer for sale), public use, or publication of the subject invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure shall identify the contract under which the subject invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding of the subject invention.

In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the subject invention for publication and any on sale or public use.<PRTPAGE P="269"/>
                </P>

                <P>(i) Interim reports every 12 months (or a longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, listing subject inventions during that period, and stating that all subject inventions have been disclosed (or that there are none) and that the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause have been followed.</P>
                <P>(ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work, listing all subject inventions or stating that there were none, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent rights clause or stating that there were none.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor shall require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in the Contractor's format each subject invention in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</P>
                <P>(5) Subject to FAR 27.302(i), the Contractor agrees that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Examination of records relating to inventions.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether—</P>
                <P>(i) Any inventions are subject inventions;</P>
                <P>(ii) The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures required by paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(4) of this clause; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor shall disclose to the Contracting Officer, for the determination of ownership rights, any unreported invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention.</P>
                <P>(3) Any examination of records under paragraph (f) of this clause will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Withholding of payment.</E> (This paragraph does not apply to subcontracts.) (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to—</P>
                <P>(i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this clause;</P>

                <P>(iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to paragraph (i)(4) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contracting Officer will withhold the reserve or balance until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.</P>
                <P>(3) The Contracting Officer will not make final payment under this contract before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer, as required by this clause, all disclosures of subject inventions, an acceptable final report, and all due confirmatory instruments.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized. The Contracting Officer will not withhold any amount under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Preference for United States industry.</E> Unless provided otherwise, neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless the person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the agency upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that, under the circumstances, domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.<PRTPAGE P="270"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> (1) The Contractor shall include the substance of the patent rights clause required by FAR Subpart 27.3 in all subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work. The prescribed patent rights clause must be modified to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause. The Contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.</P>
                <P>(2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept the clause, the Contractor—</P>
                <P>(i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(3) In subcontracts at any tier, the agency, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by the patent rights clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the agency with respect to those matters covered by this clause.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.</P>

Any resulting contract <PRTPAGE P="275"/>may also provide the Government the option to order additional data under the Additional Data Requirements clause at 52.227-16, if included in the contract. Any data delivered under the resulting contract will be subject to the Rights in Data—General clause at 52.227-14 included in this contract. Under the latter clause, a Contractor may withhold from delivery data that qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software, and deliver form, fit, and function data instead. The latter clause also may be used with its Alternates II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted rights notices, as appropriate. In addition, use of Alternate V with this latter clause provides the Government the right to inspect such data at the Contractor's facility.</P>

                <P>(a) This paragraph applies if the Contractor employs any person who, but for a waiver granted by the Secretary of Labor, would be subject to workers' compensation insurance under the Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. 1651 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). On behalf of employees for whom the applicability of the Defense Base Act has been waived, the Contractor shall (1) provide, before commencing performance under this contract, at least that workers' compensation insurance or the equivalent as the laws of the country of which these employees are nationals may require and (2) continue to maintain it until performance is completed. The Contractor shall insert, in all subcontracts under this contract to which the Defense Base Act would apply but for the waiver, a clause similar to this paragraph (a) (including this sentence) imposing upon those subcontractors this requirement to provide such workers' compensation insurance coverage.</P>

                <P>(b) This paragraph applies if the Contractor or any subcontractor under this contract employs any person who, but for a waiver granted by the Secretary of Labor, would be subject to the War Hazards Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). On behalf of employees for whom the applicability of the Defense Base Act (and hence that of the War Hazards Compensation Act) has been waived, the Contractor shall, subject to reimbursement as provided elsewhere in this contract, afford the same protection as that provided in the War Hazards Compensation Act, except that the level of benefits shall conform to any law or international agreement controlling the benefits to which the employees may be entitled. In all other respects, the standards of the War Hazards Compensation Act shall apply; e.g., the definition of war-hazard risks (injury, death, capture, or detention as the result of a war hazard as defined in the Act), proof of loss, and exclusion of benefits otherwise covered by workers' compensation insurance or the equivalent. Unless the Contractor elects to assume directly the liability to subcontractor employees created by this clause, the Contractor shall insert, in all subcontracts under this contract to which the War Hazards Compensation Act would apply but for the waiver, a clause similar to this paragraph (b) (including this sentence) imposing upon those subcontractors this requirement to provide war-hazard benefits.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Cost Accounting Standards (OCT 2015)</HD>
                <P>(a) Unless the contract is exempt under 48 CFR 9903.201-1 and 9903.201-2, the provisions of 48 CFR part 9903 are incorporated herein by reference and the Contractor, in connection with this contract, shall—</P>
                <P>(1) (CAS-covered Contracts Only) By submission of a Disclosure Statement, disclose in writing the Contractor's cost accounting practices as required by 48 CFR 9903.202-1 through 9903.202-5, including methods of distinguishing direct costs from indirect costs and the basis used for allocating indirect costs. The practices disclosed for this contract shall be the same as the practices currently disclosed and applied on all other contracts and subcontracts being performed by the Contractor and which contain a Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) clause. If the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that the Disclosure Statement contains trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is privileged and confidential, the Disclosure Statement shall be protected and shall not be released outside of the Government.</P>
                <P>(2) Follow consistently the Contractor's cost accounting practices in accumulating and reporting contract performance cost data concerning this contract. If any change in cost accounting practices is made for the purposes of any contract or subcontract subject to CAS requirements, the change must be applied prospectively to this contract and the Disclosure Statement must be amended accordingly. If the contract price or cost allowance of this contract is affected by such changes, adjustment shall be made in accordance with subparagraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this clause, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(3) Comply with all CAS, including any modifications and interpretations indicated thereto contained in 48 CFR part 9904 in effect on the date of award of this contract or, if the Contractor has submitted certified cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price as shown on the Contractor's signed certificate of current cost or pricing data. The Contractor shall also comply with any CAS (or modifications to CAS) which hereafter become applicable to a contract or subcontract of the Contractor. Such compliance shall be required prospectively from the date of applicability to such contract or subcontract.</P>
                <P>(4)(i) Agree to an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract if the contract cost is affected by a change which, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) of this clause, the Contractor is required to make to the Contractor's established cost accounting practices.</P>
                <P>(ii) Negotiate with the Contracting Officer to determine the terms and conditions under which a change may be made to a cost accounting practice, other than a change made under other provisions of subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause; provided that no agreement may be made under this provision that will increase costs paid by the United States.</P>
                <P>(iii) When the parties agree to a change to a cost accounting practice, other than a change under subdivision (a)(4)(i) of this clause, negotiate an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract.</P>
                <P>(5) Agree to an adjustment of the contract price or cost allowance, as appropriate, if the Contractor or a subcontractor fails to comply with an applicable Cost Accounting Standard, or to follow any cost accounting practice consistently and such failure results in any increased costs paid by the United States. Such adjustment shall provide for recovery of the increased costs to the United States, together with interest thereon computed at the annual rate established under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)) for such period, from the time the payment by the United States was made to the time the adjustment is effected. In no case shall the Government recover costs greater than the increased cost to the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, unless the Contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of price negotiations and which it failed to disclose to the Government.</P>

                <P>(b) If the parties fail to agree whether the Contractor or a subcontractor has complied <PRTPAGE P="297"/>with an applicable CAS in 48 CFR part 9904 or a CAS rule or regulation in 48 CFR part 9903 and as to any cost adjustment demanded by the United States, such failure to agree will constitute a dispute under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes.</P>
                <P>(c) The Contractor shall permit any authorized representatives of the Government to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records relating to compliance with the requirements of this clause.</P>
                <P>(d) The Contractor shall include in all negotiated subcontracts which the Contractor enters into, the substance of this clause, except paragraph (b), and shall require such inclusion in all other subcontracts, of any tier, including the obligation to comply with all CAS in effect on the subcontractor's award date or if the subcontractor has submitted certified cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price as shown on the subcontractor's signed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. If the subcontract is awarded to a business unit which pursuant to 48 CFR 9903.201-2 is subject to other types of CAS coverage, the substance of the applicable clause set forth in subsection 30.201-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be inserted. This requirement shall apply only to negotiated subcontracts in excess of $750,000, except that the requirement shall not apply to negotiated subcontracts otherwise exempt from the requirement to include a CAS clause as specified in 48 CFR 9903.201-1.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Cost Accounting Standards—Educational Institution (AUG 2016)</HD>
                <P>(a) Unless the contract is exempt under 48 CFR 9903.201-1 and 9903.201-2, the provisions of 48 CFR part 9903 are incorporated herein by reference and the Contractor, in connection with this contract, shall—</P>
                <P>(1) (<E T="03">CAS-covered Contracts only</E>). If a business unit of an educational institution (defined as an institution of higher education in the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart A and 20 U.S.C. 1001) is required to submit a Disclosure Statement, disclose in writing the Contractor's cost accounting practices as required by 48 CFR 9003.202-1 through 9903.202-5, including methods of distinguishing direct costs from indirect costs and the basis used for accumulating and allocating indirect costs. The practices disclosed for this contract shall be the same as the practices currently disclosed and applied on all other contracts and subcontracts being performed by the Contractor and which contain a Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) clause. If the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that the Disclosure Statement contains trade secrets, and commercial or financial information which is privileged and confidential, the Disclosure Statement shall be protected and shall not be released outside of the Government.</P>
                <P>(2) Follow consistently the Contractor's cost accounting practices in accumulating and reporting contract performance cost data concerning this contract. If any change in cost accounting practices is made for the purposes of any contract or subcontract subject to CAS requirements, the change must be applied prospectively to this contract and the Disclosure Statement, if required, must be amended accordingly. If an accounting principle change mandated under OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendix III, requires that a change in the Contractor's cost accounting practices be made after the date of this contract award, the change must be applied prospectively to this contract and the Disclosure Statement, if required, must be amended accordingly. If the contract price or cost allowance of this contract is affected by such changes, adjustment shall be made in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this clause, as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(3) Comply with all CAS, including any modifications and interpretations indicated thereto contained in 48 CFR part 9905 in effect on the date of award of this contract or, if the Contractor has submitted certified cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price as shown on the Contractor's signed certificate of current cost or pricing data. The Contractor shall also comply with any CAS (or modifications to CAS) which hereafter become applicable to a contract or subcontract of the Contractor. Such compliance shall be required prospectively from the date of applicability to such contract or subcontract.</P>
                <P>(4)(i) Agree to an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract if the contract cost is affected by a change which, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(3) of this clause, the Contractor is required to make to the Contractor's established cost accounting practices.</P>
                <P>(ii) Negotiate with the Contracting Officer to determine the terms and conditions under which a change may be made to a cost accounting practice, other than a change made under other provisions of subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause; provided that no agreement may be made under this provision that will increase costs paid by the United States.</P>
                <P>(iii) When the parties agree to a change to a cost accounting practice, other than a change under subdivision (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iv) of this clause, negotiate an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract.</P>
                <P>(iv) Agree to an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract, if the contract cost is materially affected by an accounting principle amendment required under the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendix III, which, on becoming effective after the date of contract award, requires the Contractor to make a change to the Contractor's established cost accounting practices.</P>

                <P>(5) Agree to an adjustment of the contract price or cost allowance, as appropriate, if the Contractor or a subcontractor fails to comply with an applicable Cost Accounting Standard, or to follow any cost accounting practice consistently and such failure results in any increased costs paid by the United States. Such adjustment shall provide for recovery of the increased costs to the United States, together with interest thereon computed at the annual rate established under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)) for such period, from the time the payment by the United States was made to the time the adjustment is effected. In no case shall the Government recover costs greater than the increased cost to the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, unless the Contractor <PRTPAGE P="300"/>made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of price negotiations and which it failed to disclose to the Government.</P>
                <P>(b) If the parties fail to agree whether the Contractor or a subcontractor has complied with an applicable CAS or a CAS rule or regulation in 48 CFR part 9903, and as to any cost adjustment demanded by the United States, such failure to agree will constitute a dispute under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes).</P>
                <P>(c) The Contractor shall permit any authorized representatives of the Government to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records relating to compliance with the requirements of this clause.</P>
                <P>(d) The Contractor shall include in all negotiated subcontracts which the Contractor enters into, the substance of this clause, except paragraph (b), and shall require such inclusion in all other subcontracts, of any tier, including the obligation to comply with all applicable CAS in effect on the subcontractor's award date or, if the subcontractor has submitted certified cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price as shown on the subcontractor's signed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, except that—</P>
                <P>(1) If the subcontract is awarded to a business unit which pursuant to 48 CFR 9903.201-2 is subject to other types of CAS coverage, the substance of the applicable clause set forth in 48 CFR 9903.201-4 shall be inserted;</P>

                <P>(2) Include a proposal for adjusting the higher-tier subcontract or the contract appropriately.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Payments Under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts (AUG 2012)</HD>
                <P>The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Hourly rate.</E> (1) <E T="03">Hourly rate</E> means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are—</P>
                <P>(i) Performed by the Contractor;</P>
                <P>(ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control.</P>
                <P>(2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor hours performed.</P>
                <P>(3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.</P>
                <P>(5) Vouchers may be submitted not more than once every two weeks, to the Contracting Officer or authorized representative. A small business concern may receive more frequent payments than every two weeks. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by—</P>
                <P>(i) Individual daily job timekeeping records;</P>
                <P>(ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject to the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative.</P>
                <P>(7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a) of this clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Materials.</E> (1) For the purposes of this clause—</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Direct materials</E> means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service.</P>

                <P>(A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control;</P>
                <P>(B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract;</P>
                <P>(C) Other direct costs (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); and</P>
                <P>(D) Applicable indirect costs.</P>

                <P>(2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for <PRTPAGE P="308"/>such materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the—</P>
                <P>(i) Quantities being acquired; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Actual cost of any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.</P>
                <P>(3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for allowable cost of materials provided the Contractor—</P>
                <P>(i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.</P>
                <P>(4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. The Contracting Officer will determine allowable costs of materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract.</P>
                <P>(5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they are—</P>
                <P>(i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate;</P>
                <P>(ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting practices; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates.</P>
                <P>(6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall—</P>
                <P>(i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government.</P>
                <P>(7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the prime Contractor on materials.</P>
                <P>(c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, Subcontracts, without obtaining such consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the Contractor obtains the required consent. Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at the sole discretion of the Government.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Total cost.</E> It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Ceiling price.</E> The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Audit.</E> At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to <PRTPAGE P="309"/>the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the “completion voucher” and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion voucher, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 120 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Assignment and Release of Claims.</E> The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:</P>
                <P>(1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.</P>
                <P>(3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Interim payments on contracts for other than services.</E> (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.</P>

                <P>(2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the _____ [<E T="03">Contracting Officer insert day as prescribed by agency head; if not prescribed, insert “30th”</E>] day after the designated billing office receives a proper payment request. In the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due date.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Interim payments on contracts for services.</E> For interim payments made prior to the final payment under this contract, the Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</P>

If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date.

The amount of the invoice or voucher submitted plus all advance payments previously approved shall not exceed $___ If a letter of credit is used, the Contractor shall withdraw cash only when needed for disbursements acceptable under this contract and report cash disbursements and balances as required by the administering office. The Contractor shall apply terms similar to this clause to any advance payments to subcontractors.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Special account.</E> Until (1) the Contractor has liquidated all advance payments made under the contract and related interest charges and (2) the administering office has approved in writing the release of any funds due and payable to the Contractor, all advance payments and other payments under this contract shall be made by check payable to the Contractor marked for deposit only in the Contractor's special account with the ____ [<E T="03">insert the name of the financial institution</E>].

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Computation of amounts.</E> (1) Unless the Contractor requests a smaller amount, the Government will compute each progress payment as 80 percent of the Contractor's total costs incurred under this contract whether or not actually paid, plus financing payments to subcontractors (see paragraph (j) of this clause), less the sum of all previous progress payments made by the Government under this contract. The Contracting Officer will consider cost of money that would be allowable under FAR 31.205-10 as an incurred cost for progress payment purposes.</P>
                <P>(2) The amount of financing and other payments for supplies and services purchased directly for the contract are limited to the amounts that have been paid by cash, check, or other forms of payment, or that are determined due and will be paid to subcontractors—</P>

                </P>
                <P>(ii) The contribution does not remain unpaid 30 days after the end of the applicable quarter or shorter payment period (any contribution remaining unpaid shall be excluded from the Contractor's total costs for progress payments until paid).</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor shall not include the following in total costs for progress payment purposes in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause:</P>

                <P>(7) If a progress payment or the unliquidated progress payments exceed the amounts permitted by subparagraphs (a)(4) or (a)(5) above, the Contractor shall repay the amount of such excess to the Government on demand.</P>
                <P>(8) Notwithstanding any other terms of the contract, the Contractor agrees not to request progress payments in dollar amounts of less than $2,500. The Contracting Officer may make exceptions.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Liquidation.</E> Except as provided in the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause, all progress payments shall be liquidated by deducting from any payment under this contract, other than advance or progress payments, the unliquidated progress payments, or 80 percent of the amount invoiced, whichever is less. The Contractor shall repay to the Government any amounts required by a retroactive price reduction, after computing liquidations and payments on past invoices at the reduced prices and adjusting the unliquidated progress payments accordingly. The Government reserves the right to unilaterally change from the ordinary liquidation rate to an alternate rate when deemed appropriate for proper contract financing.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reduction or suspension.</E> The Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend progress payments, increase the rate of liquidation, or take a combination of these actions, after finding on substantial evidence any of the following conditions:</P>

                <P>(2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's (i) failure to make progress or (ii) unsatisfactory financial condition.</P>

                <P>(6) The Contractor is realizing less profit than that reflected in the establishment of any alternate liquidation rate in paragraph (b) above, and that rate is less than the progress payment rate stated in subparagraph (a)(1) above.</P>

Otherwise, vestiture shall occur when the property is or should have been allocable or properly chargeable to this contract.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Property,</E> as used in this clause, includes all of the below-described items acquired or produced by the Contractor that are or should be allocable or properly chargeable to this contract under sound and generally accepted accounting principles and practices.</P>

                <P>(4) The Contractor may sell any scrap resulting from production under this contract without requesting the Contracting Officer's approval, but the proceeds shall be credited against the costs of performance.</P>
                <P>(5) To acquire for its own use or dispose of property to which title is vested in the Government under this clause, the Contractor must obtain the Contracting Officer's advance approval of the action and the terms. The Contractor shall (i) exclude the allocable costs of the property from the costs of contract performance, and (ii) repay to the Government any amount of unliquidated progress payments allocable to the property. Repayment may be by cash or credit memorandum.</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Risk of loss.</E> Before delivery to and acceptance by the Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the title to which vests in the Government under this clause, except to the extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. The Contractor shall repay the Government an amount equal to the unliquidated progress payments that are based on costs allocable to property that is lost (see 45.101).</P>

Costs incurred which are subject to this limitation shall be segregated on Contractor progress payment requests and invoices from those costs eligible for higher progress payment rates. For purposes of progress payment liquidation, as described in paragraph (b) of this clause, progress payments for undefinitized contract actions shall be liquidated at 80 percent of the amount invoiced for work performed under the undefinitized contract action as long as the contract action remains undefinitized. The amount of unliquidated progress payments for undefinitized contract actions shall not exceed 80 percent of the maximum liability of the Government under the undefinitized contract action or such lower limit specified elsewhere in the contract.

In the event that the Government requires an <PRTPAGE P="323"/>audit or other review of a specific progress payment request to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due date. Progress payments are considered contract financing and are not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.</P>

                <P>(e) If, after notification, additional funds are not allotted by the end of the period specified in the Schedule or another agreed-upon date, upon the Contractor's written request the Contracting Officer will terminate this contract on that date in accordance with the provisions of the Termination clause of this contract. If the Contractor estimates that the funds available will allow it to continue to discharge its obligations beyond that date, it may specify a later date in its request, and the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract on that later date.</P>

                <P>(g) The estimated cost shall be increased to the extent that (1) the amount allotted by the Government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount then allotted by the Government to the contract plus the Contractor's corresponding share, exceeds the estimated cost specified in the Schedule. If this is a cost-sharing contract, the increase shall be allocated in accordance with the formula specified in the Schedule.</P>
                <P>(h) No notice, communication, or representation in any form other than that specified in subparagraph (f)(2) above, or from any person other than the Contracting Officer, shall affect the amount allotted by the Government to this contract. In the absence of the specified notice, the Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for any costs in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government to this contract, whether incurred during the course of the contract or as a result of termination.</P>
                <P>(i) When and to the extent that the amount allotted by the Government to the contract is increased, any costs the Contractor incurs before the increase that are in excess of (1) the amount previously allotted by the Government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount previously allotted by the Government to the contract plus the Contractor's corresponding share, shall be allowable to the same extent as if incurred afterward, unless the Contracting Officer issues a termination or other notice and directs that the increase is solely to cover termination or other specified expenses.</P>
                <P>(j) Change orders shall not be considered an authorization to exceed the amount allotted by the Government specified in the Schedule, unless they contain a statement increasing the amount allotted.</P>
                <P>(k) Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of the Government to terminate this contract. If this contract is terminated, the Government and the Contractor shall negotiate an equitable distribution of all property produced or purchased under the contract, based upon the share of costs incurred by each.</P>
                <P>(l) If the Government does not allot sufficient funds to allow completion of the work, the Contractor is entitled to a percentage of the fee specified in the Schedule equalling the percentage of completion of the work contemplated by this contract.</P>

                <P>Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. The Government considers payment as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer (EFT). Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in sections 2.101, 32.001, and 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified. (However, see paragraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Invoice payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Due date.</E> (i) Except as indicated in paragraphs (a)(2) and (c) of this clause, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office is the later of the following two events:</P>
                <P>(A) The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor (except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this clause).</P>
                <P>(B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed. For a final invoice, when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract settlement.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice, provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Certain food products and other payments.</E> (i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are—</P>
                <P>(A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)), and as further defined in Pub. L. 98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</P>
                <P>(B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</P>
                <P>(C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract.</P>
                <P>(D) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the Contractor making the representation.</P>

                <P>(ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract.<PRTPAGE P="328"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Contractor's invoice.</E> The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(x) of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office will return it within 7 days after receipt (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. The Government will take into account untimely notification when computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(i) Name and address of the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (The Contractor should date invoices as close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)</P>
                <P>(iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed (including order number and line item number).</P>
                <P>(iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.</P>
                <P>(v) Shipping and payment terms (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> shipment number and date of shipment, discount for prompt payment terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills of lading.</P>
                <P>(vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).</P>
                <P>(vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.</P>
                <P>(viii) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</P>
                <P>(ix) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.</P>
                <P>(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</P>

                <P>(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.</P>
                <P>(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.</P>

                <P>(x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> evidence of shipment).</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Interest penalty.</E> The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the designated payment office may make payment on the following working day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.</P>
                <P>(i) The designated billing office received a proper invoice.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Government processed a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.</P>
                <P>(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Computing penalty amount.</E> The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</P>
                <P>(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</P>

                <P>(ii) The prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR 1315.10(c) do not require the Government to pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Government and the Contractor shall resolve claims <PRTPAGE P="329"/>involving disputes and any interest that may be payable in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Discounts for prompt payment.</E> The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment improperly. The Government will calculate the interest penalty in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Additional interest penalty.</E> (i) The designated payment office will pay a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315 in addition to the interest penalty amount only if—</P>
                <P>(A) The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more;</P>
                <P>(B) The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and</P>
                <P>(C) The Contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid.</P>
                <P>(ii)(A) The Contractor shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. The Government will not request any additional data. The Contractor shall—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest is due; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.</P>
                <P>(B) If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible—</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The designated payment office that receives the demand will annotate it with the date of receipt, provided the demand is received on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the Government will determine the demand's validity based on the date the Contractor has placed on the demand, provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.</P>

                <P>(iii) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> payments under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Contract financing payment.</E> If this contract provides for contract financing, the Government will make contract financing payments in accordance with the applicable contract financing clause.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Fast payment procedure due dates.</E> If this contract contains the clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.</P>

                <P>(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.</P>

Constructive acceptance or constructive approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, Contractor compliance with a contract provision, or requested progress payment amounts. These requirements also do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve Contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</P>
                <P>(A) For work or services completed by the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day after the Contractor completes the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.</P>

              <P>As prescribed in 32.908(b), insert the following clause:</P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts (JAN 2017)</HD>
                <P>Notwithstanding any other payment terms in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. The Government considers payment as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer. Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in sections 2.101, 32.001, and 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified. (However, see paragraph (a)(3) concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Invoice payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Types of invoice payments.</E> For purposes of this clause, there are several types of invoice payments that may occur under this contract, as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Progress payments, if provided for elsewhere in this contract, based on Contracting Officer approval of the estimated amount and value of work or services performed, including payments for reaching milestones in any project.</P>
                <P>(A) The due date for making such payments is 14 days after the designated billing office receives a proper payment request. If the designated billing office fails to annotate the payment request with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the payment due date is the 14th day after the date of the Contractor's payment request, provided the designated billing office receives a proper payment request and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.</P>
                <P>(B) The due date for payment of any amounts retained by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, is as specified in the contract or, if not specified, 30 days after approval by the Contracting Officer for release to the Contractor.</P>

                <P>(ii) Final payments based on completion and acceptance of all work and presentation of release of all claims against the Government arising by virtue of the contract, and payments for partial deliveries that have been accepted by the Government (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> each separate building, public work, or other division of the contract for which the price is stated separately in the contract).</P>
                <P>(A) The due date for making such payments is the later of the following two events:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or services completed by the Contractor. For a final invoice when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> release of claims), acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract settlement.</P>
                <P>(B) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the date of actual receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice, provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Contractor's invoice.</E> The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(xi) of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office must return it within 7 days after receipt, with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. When computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor, the Government will take into account if the Government notifies the Contractor of an improper invoice in an untimely manner.</P>
                <P>(i) Name and address of the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (The Contractor should date invoices as close as possible to the date of mailing or transmission.)</P>
                <P>(iii) Contract number or other authorization for work or services performed (including order number and line item number).</P>
                <P>(iv) Description of work or services performed.</P>
                <P>(v) Delivery and payment terms (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> discount for prompt payment terms).</P>
                <P>(vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).</P>
                <P>(vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.</P>
                <P>(viii) For payments described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this clause, substantiation of the amounts requested and certification in accordance with the requirements of the clause at 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts.</P>
                <P>(ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</P>
                <P>(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.</P>
                <P>(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</P>

                <P>(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the <PRTPAGE P="333"/>invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—System for Award Management , or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.</P>
                <P>(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.</P>
                <P>(xi) Any other information or documentation required by the contract.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Interest penalty.</E> The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable.

                <P>(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for work or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Computing penalty amount.</E> The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</P>
                <P>(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor for payments described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this clause, Government acceptance or approval is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day after the Contractor has completed the work or services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. If actual acceptance or approval occurs within the constructive acceptance or approval period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance or approval. Constructive acceptance or constructive approval requirements do not apply if there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. These requirements also do not compel Government officials to accept work or services, approve Contractor estimates, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</P>
                <P>(ii) The prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR 1315.10(c) do not require the Government to pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract.

The number of installment payments authorized for each unit of a line item is equal to the number of months from the date of contract award to the date one month before the first delivery of the first separately priced unit of the line item.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Contractor request for performance-based payment.</E> The Contractor may submit requests for payment of performance-based payments not more frequently than monthly, in a form and manner acceptable to the Contracting Officer. Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer, all performance-based payments in any period for which payment is being requested shall be included in a single request, appropriately itemized and totaled. The Contractor's request shall contain the information and certification detailed in paragraphs (l) and (m) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval and payment of requests.</E> (1) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of a request for performance-based payment prior to successful accomplishment of the event or performance criterion for which payment is requested. The Contracting Officer shall determine whether the event or performance criterion for which payment is requested has been successfully accomplished in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Contracting Officer may, at any time, require the Contractor to substantiate the successful performance of any event or performance criterion which has been or is represented as being payable.</P>

                <P>(2) A payment under this performance-based payment clause is a contract financing payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this contract and not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act. The designated payment office will pay approved requests on the _____ [<E T="03">Contracting Officer insert day as prescribed by agency head; if not prescribed, insert “30th”</E>] day after receipt of the request for performance-based payment by the designated payment office. However, the designated payment office is not required to provide payment if the Contracting Officer requires substantiation as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or inquires into the status of an event or performance criterion, or into any of the conditions listed in paragraph (a) of this clause, or into the Contractor certification. The payment period will not begin until the Contracting Officer approves the request.</P>
                <P>(3) The approval by the Contracting Officer of a request for performance-based payment does not constitute an acceptance by the Government and does not excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Liquidation of performance-based payments.</E> (1) Performance-based finance amounts paid prior to payment for delivery of an item shall be liquidated by deducting a percentage or a designated dollar amount from the delivery payment. If the performance-based finance payments are on a delivery item basis, the liquidation amount for each such line item shall be the percent of that delivery item price that was previously paid under performance-based finance payments or the designated dollar amount. If <PRTPAGE P="340"/>the performance-based finance payments are on a whole contract basis, liquidation shall be by either predesignated liquidation amounts or a liquidation percentage.</P>
                <P>(2) If at any time the amount of payments under this contract exceeds any limitation in this contract, the Contractor shall repay to the Government the excess. Unless otherwise determined by the Contracting Officer, such excess shall be credited as a reduction in the unliquidated performance-based payment balance(s), after adjustment of invoice payments and balances for any retroactive price adjustments.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Reduction or suspension of performance-based payments.</E> The Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend performance-based payments, liquidate performance-based payments by deduction from any payment under the contract, or take a combination of these actions after finding upon substantial evidence any of the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(1) The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of this contract (which includes paragraphs (h) and (i) of this clause).</P>
                <P>(2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's (i) failure to make progress, or (ii) unsatisfactory financial condition.</P>
                <P>(3) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of any subcontractor or supplier under this contract in the ordinary course of business.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Title.</E> (1) Title to the property described in this paragraph (f) shall vest in the Government. Vestiture shall be immediately upon the date of the first performance-based payment under this contract, for property acquired or produced before that date. Otherwise, vestiture shall occur when the property is or should have been allocable or properly chargeable to this contract.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Property,</E> as used in this clause, includes all of the following described items acquired or produced by the Contractor that are or should be allocable or properly chargeable to this contract under sound and generally accepted accounting principles and practices:</P>
                <P>(i) Parts, materials, inventories, and work in process;</P>
                <P>(ii) Special tooling and special test equipment to which the Government is to acquire title;</P>
                <P>(iii) Nondurable (i.e., noncapital) tools, jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, taps, gauges, test equipment and other similar manufacturing aids, title to which would not be obtained as special tooling under subparagraph (f)(2)(ii) of this clause; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Drawings and technical data, to the extent the Contractor or subcontractors are required to deliver them to the Government by other clauses of this contract.</P>
                <P>(3) Although title to property is in the Government under this clause, other applicable clauses of this contract (e.g., the termination clauses) shall determine the handling and disposition of the property.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor may sell any scrap resulting from production under this contract, without requesting the Contracting Officer's approval, provided that any significant reduction in the value of the property to which the Government has title under this clause is reported in writing to the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(5) In order to acquire for its own use or dispose of property to which title is vested in the Government under this clause, the Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's advance approval of the action and the terms. If approved, the basis for payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(6) When the Contractor completes all of the obligations under this contract, including liquidation of all performance-based payments, title shall vest in the Contractor for all property (or the proceeds thereof) not—</P>
                <P>(i) Delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Incorporated in supplies delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract and to which title is vested in the Government under this clause.</P>
                <P>(7) The terms of this contract concerning liability for Government-furnished property shall not apply to property to which the Government acquired title solely under this clause.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Risk of loss.</E> Before delivery to and acceptance by the Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the title to which vests in the Government under this clause, except to the extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. If any property is lost (see 45.101), the basis of payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Records and controls.</E> The Contractor shall maintain records and controls adequate for administration of this clause. The Contractor shall have no entitlement to performance-based payments during any time the Contractor's records or controls are determined by the Contracting Officer to be inadequate for administration of this clause.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Reports and Government access.</E> The Contractor shall promptly furnish reports, certificates, financial statements, and other <PRTPAGE P="341"/>pertinent information requested by the Contracting Officer for the administration of this clause and to determine that an event or other criterion prompting a financing payment has been successfully accomplished. The Contractor shall give the Government reasonable opportunity to examine and verify the Contractor's records and to examine and verify the Contractor's performance of this contract for administration of this clause.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Special terms regarding default.</E> If this contract is terminated under the Default clause, (1) the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated performance-based payments, and (2) title shall vest in the Contractor, on full liquidation of all performance-based payments, for all property for which the Government elects not to require delivery under the Default clause of this contract. The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the Default clause.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Reservation of rights.</E> (1) No payment or vesting of title under this clause shall (i) excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract, or (ii) constitute a waiver of any of the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.</P>
                <P>(2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause (i) shall not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or this contract, and (ii) shall not be affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Content of Contractor's request for performance-based payment.</E> The Contractor's request for performance-based payment shall contain the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The name and address of the Contractor;</P>
                <P>(2) The date of the request for performance-based payment;</P>

                <P>(m) <E T="03">Content of Contractor's certification.</E> As required in paragraph (l)(5) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the following certification in each request for performance-based payment:</P>
                <P>I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that—</P>
                <P>(1) This request for performance-based payment is true and correct; this request (and attachments) has been prepared from the books and records of the Contractor, in accordance with the contract and the instructions of the Contracting Officer;</P>
                <P>(2) (Except as reported in writing on _______), all payments to subcontractors and suppliers under this contract have been paid, or will be paid, currently, when due in the ordinary course of business;</P>
                <P>(3) There are no encumbrances (except as reported in writing on _______) against the property acquired or produced for, and allocated or properly chargeable to, the contract which would affect or impair the Government's title;</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Method of payment.</E> (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term “EFT” refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.</P>
                <P>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either—</P>
                <P>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Contractor's EFT information.</E> The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management <PRTPAGE P="342"/>(SAM). In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to SAM.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanisms for EFT payment.</E> The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Suspension of payment.</E> If the Contractor's EFT information in SAM is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into SAM; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.</E> (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for—</P>
                <P>(i) Making a correct payment;</P>
                <P>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.</P>
                <P>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and—</P>
                <P>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</P>
                <P>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">EFT and prompt payment.</E> A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">EFT and assignment of claims.</E> If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in SAM and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent.</E> The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Payment information.</E> The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in SAM.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanisms for EFT payment.</E> The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Suspension of payment.</E> (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor.

                <P>(a) The Contractor shall keep on the work site a copy of the drawings and specifications and shall at all times give the Contracting Officer access thereto. Anything mentioned in the specifications and not shown on the drawings, or shown on the drawings and not mentioned in the specifications, shall be of like effect as if shown or mentioned in both. In case of difference between drawings and specifications, the specifications shall govern. In case of discrepancy in the figures, in the drawings, or in the specifications, the matter shall be promptly submitted to the Contracting Officer, who shall promptly make a determination in writing. Any adjustment by the Contractor without such a determination shall be at its own risk and expense. The Contracting Officer shall furnish from time to time such detailed drawings and other information as considered necessary, unless otherwise provided.</P>

                <P>(b) Wherever in the specifications or upon the drawings the words <E T="03">directed, required, ordered, designated, prescribed,</E> or words of like import are used, it shall be understood that the <E T="03">direction, requirement, order, designation,</E> or <E T="03">prescription,</E> of the Contracting Officer is intended and similarly the words <E T="03">approved, acceptable, satisfactory,</E> or words of like import shall mean <E T="03">approved by,</E> or <E T="03">acceptable to,</E> or <E T="03">satisfactory to</E> the Contracting Officer, unless otherwise expressly stated.</P>
                <P>(c) Where <E T="03">as shown, as indicated, as detailed,</E> or words of similar import are used, it shall be understood that the reference is made to the drawings accompanying this contract unless stated otherwise.

                </P>
                <P>(d) Shop drawings means drawings, submitted to the Government by the Contractor, subcontractor, or any lower tier subcontractor pursuant to a construction contract, showing in detail (1) the proposed fabrication and assembly of structural elements and (2) the installation (i.e., form, fit, and attachment details) of materials or equipment. It includes drawings, diagrams, layouts, schematics, descriptive literature, illustrations, schedules, performance and test data, and similar materials furnished by the contractor to explain in detail specific portions of the work required by the contract. The Government may duplicate, use, and disclose in any manner and for any purpose shop drawings delivered under this contract.</P>
                <P>(e) If this contract requires shop drawings, the Contractor shall coordinate all such drawings, and review them for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with contract requirements and shall indicate its approval thereon as evidence of such coordination and review. Shop drawings submitted to the Contracting Officer without evidence of the Contractor's approval may be returned for resubmission. The Contracting Officer will indicate an approval or disapproval of the shop drawings and if not approved as submitted shall indicate the Government's reasons therefor. Any work done before such approval shall be at the Contractor's risk. Approval by the Contracting Officer shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for any errors or omissions in such drawings, nor from responsibility for complying with the requirements of this contract, except with respect to variations described and approved in accordance with (f) below.</P>
                <P>(f) If shop drawings show variations from the contract requirements, the Contractor shall describe such variations in writing, separate from the drawings, at the time of submission. If the Contracting Officer approves any such variation, the Contracting Officer shall issue an appropriate contract modification, except that, if the variation is minor or does not involve a change in price or in time of performance, a modification need not be issued.</P>

                <P>(g) The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer for approval four copies (unless otherwise indicated) of all shop drawings as called for under the various headings of these specifications. Three sets (unless <PRTPAGE P="358"/>otherwise indicated) of all shop drawings, will be retained by the Contracting Officer and one set will be returned to the Contractor.</P>

                <P>(a) The Contractor shall accomplish the design services required under this contract so as to permit the award of a contract, using standard Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures for the construction of the facilities designed at a price that does not exceed the estimated construction contract price as set forth in paragraph (c) below. When bids or proposals for the construction contract are received that exceed the estimated price, the contractor shall perform such redesign and other services as are necessary to permit contract award within the funding limitation. These additional services shall be performed at no increase in the price of this contract. However, the Contractor shall not be required to perform such additional services at no cost to the Government if the unfavorable bids or proposals are the result of conditions beyond its reasonable control.</P>
                <P>(b) The Contractor will promptly advise the Contracting Officer if it finds that the project being designed will exceed or is likely to exceed the funding limitations and it is unable to design a usable facility within these limitations. Upon receipt of such information, the Contracting Officer will review the Contractor's revised estimate of construction cost. The Government may, if it determines that the estimated construction contract price set forth in this contract is so low that award of a construction contract not in excess of such estimate is improbable, authorize a change in scope or materials as required to reduce the estimated construction cost to an amount within the estimated construction contract price set forth in paragraph (c) below, or the Government may adjust such estimated construction contract price. When bids or proposals are not solicited or are unreasonably delayed, the Government shall prepare an estimate of constructing the design submitted and such estimate shall be used in lieu of bids or proposals to determine compliance with the funding limitation.</P>

The equitable adjustment shall not include increased costs or time extensions for delay resulting from the Contractor's failure to provide notice or to continue performance as provided, respectively, in (b) and (c) above.</P>

Authorizing such use of the Government property does not waive any rights of the Government to terminate the Contractor's right to use the Government property. The rental fee shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Rental requests shall be submitted to the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), identify the property for which rental is requested, propose a rental period, and compute an estimated rental charge by using the Contractor's best estimate of rental time in the formulae described in paragraph (e) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor shall not use Government property for nongovernmental purposes, including Independent Research and Development, until a rental charge for real property, or estimated rental charge for other property, is agreed upon.

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Rental charge</E>—(1) <E T="03">Real property and associated fixtures.</E> (i) The Contractor shall obtain, at its expense, a property appraisal from an independent licensed, accredited, or certified appraiser that computes a monthly, daily, or hourly rental rate for comparable commercial property. The appraisal may be used to compute rentals under this clause throughout its effective period or, if an effective period is not stated in the appraisal, for one year following the date the appraisal was performed. The Contractor shall submit the appraisal to the ACO at least 30 days prior to the date the property is needed for nongovernmental use. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this clause, the ACO shall use the appraisal rental rate to determine a reasonable rental charge.</P>
                <P>(ii) Rental charges shall be determined by multiplying the rental time by the appraisal rental rate expressed as a rate per hour. Monthly or daily appraisal rental rates shall be divided by 720 or 24, respectively, to determine an hourly rental rate.</P>
                <P>(iii) When the ACO believes the appraisal rental rate is unreasonable, the ACO shall promptly notify the Contractor. The parties may agree on an alternative means for computing a reasonable rental charge.</P>
                <P>(iv) The Contractor shall obtain, at its expense, additional property appraisals in the same manner as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(i) if the effective period has expired and the Contractor desires the continued use of property for nongovernmental use. The Contractor may obtain additional appraisals within the effective period of the current appraisal if the market prices decrease substantially.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Other Government property.</E> The Contractor may elect to compute the rental charge using the appraisal method described in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause subject to the constraints therein or the following formula in which rental time shall be expressed in increments of not less than one hour with portions of hours rounded to the next higher hour: The hourly rental charge is calculated by multiplying 2 percent of the acquisition cost by the hours of rental time, and dividing by 720.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternative methodology.</E> The Contractor may request consideration of an alternative basis for computing the rental charge if it considers the monthly rental rate or a time-based rental unreasonable or impractical.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Rental payments.</E> (1) Rent is due 60 days following completion of the rental period or as otherwise specified in the contract. The Contractor shall compute the rental due, and furnish records or other supporting data in sufficient detail to permit the ACO to verify the rental time and computation. Payment shall be made by check payable to the Treasurer of the United States and sent to the contract administration office identified in this contract, unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer.</P>

                <P>(2) Interest will be charged if payment is not made by the date specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause.

                <P>(3) The Government's acceptance of any rental payment under this clause, in whole or in part, shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of any rights it may have against the Contractor stemming from the Contractor's unauthorized use of Government property or any other failure to perform this contract according to its terms.</P>

                <P>(h) <E T="03">Unauthorized use.</E> The unauthorized use of Government property can subject a person to fines, imprisonment, or both, under 18 U.S.C. 641.</P>

                <P>(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</P>
                <P>(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance.

                <P>(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</P>
                <P>(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected.

                <P>(a) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the work under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires.</P>
                <P>(b) The Government has the right to inspect and test all work called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the premises of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.</P>
                <P>(c) If the Government performs any inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises.</P>
                <P>(d) The Government shall accept or reject the work as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise specified in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the work shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming work. Work is nonconforming when it is defective in material or workmanship or is otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements.</P>
                <P>(e) The Government has the right to reject nonconforming work. If the Contractor fails or is unable to correct or to replace nonconforming work within the delivery schedule (or such later time as the Contracting Officer may authorize), the Contracting Officer may accept the work and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree on a price reduction shall be a dispute.</P>

                <P>(f) Inspection and test by the Government does not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for defects or other failures to meet the contract requirements that may be discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise specified in the contract. If acceptance is not conclusive for any of these causes, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies (work) at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; <E T="03">provided,</E> the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or (2) within a reasonable time after the Contractor's receipt of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repayment of such portion of the contract price as is equitable under the circumstances if the Government elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies (work) are (is) returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point of delivery when that point is not the Contractor's plant.</P>

If this is a multiyear contract, the term does not include quantities funded after VECP acceptance. If this contract is a fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers to the period for which firm prices have been established.</P>
                <P>
                  <E T="03">Instant unit cost reduction</E> means the amount of the decrease in unit cost of performance (without deducting any Contractor's development or implementation costs) resulting from using the VECP on this, the instant contract. If this is a service contract, the instant unit cost reduction is normally equal to the number of hours per line-item task saved by using the VECP on this contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract labor rate.</P>

                <P>(2) A list and analysis of the contract requirements that must be changed if the VECP is accepted, including any suggested specification revisions.</P>
                <P>(3) Identification of the unit to which the VECP applies.</P>
                <P>(4) A separate, detailed cost estimate for (i) the affected portions of the existing contract requirement and (ii) the VECP. The cost reduction associated with the VECP shall take into account the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs, including any amount attributable to subcontracts under the Subcontracts paragraph of this clause, below.</P>
                <P>(5) A description and estimate of costs the Government may incur in implementing the VECP, such as test and evaluation and operating and support costs.</P>

                <P>(7) A statement of the time by which a contract modification accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost reduction, noting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule.</P>
                <P>(8) Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP, including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers involved, and previous Government actions, if known.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission.</E> The Contractor shall submit VECP's to the Contracting Officer, unless <PRTPAGE P="437"/>this contract states otherwise. If this contract is administered by other than the contracting office, the Contractor shall submit a copy of the VECP simultaneously to the Contracting Officer and to the Administrative Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Government action.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the contracting office receives it. If additional time is required, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within the 45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and the expected date of the decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; however, it will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.</P>
                <P>(2) If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. The Contractor may withdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may require that the Contractor provide written notification before undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort.</P>
                <P>(3) Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing this clause and made either before or within a reasonable time after contract performance is completed. Until such a contract modification applies a VECP to this contract, the Contractor shall perform in accordance with the existing contract. The decision to accept or reject all or part of any VECP is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Sharing rates.</E> If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor shall share in net acquisition savings according to the percentages shown in the table below. The percentage paid the Contractor depends upon (1) this contract's type (fixed-price, incentive, or cost-reimbursement), (2) the sharing arrangement specified in paragraph (a) above (incentive, program requirement, or a combination as delineated in the Schedule), and (3) the source of the savings (the instant contract, or concurrent and future contracts), as follows:</P>

                <P>(g) <E T="03">Calculating net acquisition savings.</E> (1) Acquisition savings are realized when (i) the cost or price is reduced on the instant contract, (ii) reductions are negotiated in concurrent contracts, (iii) future contracts are awarded, or (iv) agreement is reached on a lump-sum payment for future contract savings (see subparagraph (i)(4) below). Net acquisition savings are first realized, and the Contractor shall be paid a share, when Government costs and any negative instant contract savings have been fully offset against acquisition savings.</P>
                <P>(2) Except in incentive contracts, Government costs and any price or cost increases resulting from negative instant contract savings shall be offset against acquisition savings each time such savings are realized until they are fully offset. Then, the Contractor's share is calculated by multiplying net acquisition savings by the appropriate Contractor's percentage sharing rate (see paragraph (f) above). Additional Contractor shares of net acquisition savings shall be paid to the Contractor at the time realized.</P>

                <P>(3) If this is an incentive contract, recovery of Government costs on the instant contract shall be deferred and offset against concurrent and future contract savings. The Contractor shall share through the contract incentive structure in savings on the instant contract items affected. Any negative instant contract savings shall be added to the target cost or to the target price and ceiling price, and the amount shall be offset against concurrent and future contract savings.<PRTPAGE P="438"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) If the Government does not receive and accept all items on which it paid the Contractor's share, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for the proportionate share of these payments.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Contract adjustment.</E> The modification accepting the VECP (or a subsequent modification issued as soon as possible after any negotiations are completed) shall—</P>
                <P>(1) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of instant contract savings, unless this is an incentive contract;</P>
                <P>(2) When the amount of instant contract savings is negative, increase the contract price, target price and ceiling price, target cost, or estimated cost by that amount;</P>
                <P>(3) Specify the Contractor's dollar share per unit on future contracts, or provide the lump-sum payment;</P>
                <P>(4) Specify the amount of any Government costs or negative instant contract savings to be offset in determining net acquisition savings realized from concurrent or future contract savings; and</P>
                <P>(5) Provide the Contractor's share of any net acquisition savings under the instant contract in accordance with the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Fixed-price contracts—add to contract price.</P>
                <P>(ii) Cost-reimbursement contracts—add to contract fee.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Concurrent and future contract savings.</E> (1) Payments of the Contractor's share of concurrent and future contract savings shall be made by a modification to the instant contract in accordance with subparagraph (h)(5) above. For incentive contracts, shares shall be added as a separate firm-fixed-price line item on the instant contract. The Contractor shall maintain records adequate to identify the first delivered unit for 3 years after final payment under this contract.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of concurrent contract savings by (i) subtracting from the reduction in price negotiated on the concurrent contract any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet offset and (ii) multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.</P>
                <P>(3) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of future contract savings by (i) multiplying the future unit cost reduction by the number of future contract units scheduled for delivery during the sharing period, (ii) subtracting any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet offset, and (iii) multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate.</P>
                <P>(4) When the Government wishes and the Contractor agrees, the Contractor's share of future contract savings may be paid in a single lump sum rather than in a series of payments over time as future contracts are awarded. Under this alternate procedure, the future contract savings may be calculated when the VECP is accepted, on the basis of the Contracting Officer's forecast of the number of units that will be delivered during the sharing period. The Contractor's share shall be included in a modification to this contract (see subparagraph (h)(3) above) and shall not be subject to subsequent adjustment.</P>
                <P>(5) Alternate no-cost settlement method. When, in accordance with subsection 48.104-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Government and the Contractor mutually agree to use the no-cost settlement method, the following applies:</P>
                <P>(i) The Contractor will keep all the savings on the instant contract and on its concurrent contracts only.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Government will keep all the savings resulting from concurrent contracts placed on other sources, savings from all future contracts, and all collateral savings.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Collateral savings.</E> If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount, as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this clause, by a rate from 20 to 100 percent, as determined by the Contracting Officer, of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the Contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed the contract's firm-fixed-price, target price, target cost, or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer will be the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.</P>
                <P>(k) <E T="03">Relationship to other incentives.</E> Only those benefits of an accepted VECP not rewardable under performance, design-to-cost (production unit cost, operating and support costs, reliability and maintainability), or similar incentives shall be rewarded under this clause. However, the targets of such incentives affected by the VECP shall not be adjusted because of VECP acceptance. If this contract specifies targets but provides no incentive to surpass them, the value engineering sharing shall apply only to the amount of achievement better than target.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> The Contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract of $150,000 or more and may include one in subcontracts of lesser value. In calculating any adjustment in this contract's price for instant contract savings (or negative instant contract savings), the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable development and implementation costs, and any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor, clearly resulting from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract. The Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor value engineering incentive payments; <E T="03">provided,</E> that the payments shall not reduce the Government's <PRTPAGE P="439"/>share of concurrent or future contract savings or collateral savings.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Data.</E> The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use any part of a VECP or the supporting data by marking the following legend on the affected parts:
                </P>
                <FP>“These data, furnished under the Value Engineering clause of contract ____, shall not be disclosed outside the Government or duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted under the clause. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in these data if it has been obtained or is otherwise available from the Contractor or from another source without limitations.”</FP>
                

                <P>If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor hereby grants the Government unlimited rights in the VECP and supporting data, except that, with respect to data qualifying and submitted as limited rights technical data, the Government shall have the rights specified in the contract modification implementing the VECP and shall appropriately mark the data. (The terms <E T="03">unlimited rights</E> and <E T="03">limited rights</E> are defined in part 27 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.)</P>

                <P>(1) Requires a change to this, the instant contract, to implement; and</P>

                <P>(2) Results in reducing the contract price or estimated cost without impairing essential functions or characteristics; <E T="03">provided,</E> that it does not involve a change—</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">VECP preparation.</E> As a minimum, the Contractor shall include in each VECP the information described in subparagraphs (1) through (7) below. If the proposed change is affected by contractually required configuration management or similar procedures, the instructions in those procedures relating to format, identification, and priority assignment shall govern VECP preparation. The VECP shall include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A description of the difference between the existing contract requirement and that proposed, the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each, a justification when an item's function or characteristics are being altered, and the effect of the change on the end item's performance.</P>

                <P>(6) A statement of the time by which a contract modification accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost reduction, noting any effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule.</P>
                <P>(7) Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP, including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers involved, and previous Government actions, if known.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission.</E> The Contractor shall submit VECP's to the Resident Engineer at the worksite, with a copy to the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Government action.</E> (1) The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the contracting office receives it. If additional time is required, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within the 45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and the expected date of the decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; however, it will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.</P>
                <P>(2) If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. The Contractor may withdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may require that the Contractor provide written notification before undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort.</P>
                <P>(3) Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing this clause. The Contracting Officer may accept the VECP, even though an agreement on price reduction has not been reached, by issuing the Contractor a notice to proceed with the change. Until a notice to proceed is issued or a contract modification applies a VECP to this contract, the Contractor shall perform in accordance with the existing contract. The decision to accept or reject all or part of any VECP is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Sharing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rates.</E> The Government's share of savings is determined by subtracting Government costs from instant contract savings and multiplying the result by (i) 45 percent for fixed-price contracts or (ii) 75 percent for cost-reimbursement contracts.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment.</E> Payment of any share due the Contractor for use of a VECP on this contract shall be authorized by a modification to this contract to—</P>
                <P>(i) Accept the VECP;</P>
                <P>(ii) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of instant contract savings; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Provide the Contractor's share of savings by adding the amount calculated to the contract price or fee.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Collateral savings.</E> If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount by 20 percent of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the Contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed the contract's firm-fixed-price or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer is the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> The Contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract of $70,000 or more and may include one in subcontracts of lesser value. In computing any adjustment in this contract's price under paragraph (f) above, the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable development and implementation costs clearly resulting from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract, but shall exclude any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor. The Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor value engineering incentive payments; <E T="03">provided,</E> that <PRTPAGE P="442"/>these payments shall not reduce the Government's share of the savings resulting from the VECP.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Data.</E> The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use any part of a VECP or the supporting data by marking the following legend on the affected parts:

                <FP>“These data, furnished under the Value Engineering—Construction clause of contract ____, shall not be disclosed outside the Government or duplicated, used, or disclosed, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted under the clause.

                <P>(a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this contract in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Contractor a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of termination and the effective date.</P>
                <P>(b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed with the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining or adjusting any amounts due under this clause:</P>
                <P>(1) Stop work as specified in the notice.</P>

                <P>(4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Contractor under the subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal arising out of those terminations.</P>
                <P>(5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; the approval or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.</P>

                <P>(6) As directed by the Contracting Officer, transfer title and deliver to the Government <PRTPAGE P="443"/>(i) the fabricated or unfabricated parts, work in process, completed work, supplies, and other material produced or acquired for the work terminated, and (ii) the completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information, and other property that, if the contract had been completed, would be required to be furnished to the Government.</P>
                <P>(7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.</P>
                <P>(8) Take any action that may be necessary, or that the Contracting Officer may direct, for the protection and preservation of the property related to this contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and in which the Government has or may acquire an interest.</P>

                <P>(9) Use its best efforts to sell, as directed or authorized by the Contracting Officer, any property of the types referred to in subparagraph (b)(6) of this clause; <E T="03">provided,</E> however, that the Contractor (i) is not required to extend credit to any purchaser and (ii) may acquire the property under the conditions prescribed by, and at prices approved by, the Contracting Officer. The proceeds of any transfer or disposition will be applied to reduce any payments to be made by the Government under this contract, credited to the price or cost of the work, or paid in any other manner directed by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(c) The Contractor shall submit complete termination inventory schedules no later than 120 days from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within this 120-day period.</P>
                <P>(d) After expiration of the plant clearance period as defined in subpart 49.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Contractor may submit to the Contracting Officer a list, certified as to quantity and quality, of termination inventory not previously disposed of, excluding items authorized for disposition by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request the Government to remove those items or enter into an agreement for their storage. Within 15 days, the Government will accept title to those items and remove them or enter into a storage agreement. The Contracting Officer may verify the list upon removal of the items, or if stored, within 45 days from submission of the list, and shall correct the list, as necessary, before final settlement.</P>
                <P>(e) After termination, the Contractor shall submit a final termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received and acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Contractor fails to submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, due the Contractor because of the termination and shall pay the amount determined.</P>
                <P>(f) Subject to paragraph (e) of this clause, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount to be paid or remaining to be paid because of the termination. The amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done. However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (f) or paragraph (g) of this clause, exclusive of costs shown in subparagraph (g)(3) of this clause, may not exceed the total contract price as reduced by (1) the amount of payments previously made and (2) the contract price of work not terminated.

Paragraph (g) of this clause shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon to be paid under this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(g) If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on the whole amount to be paid because of the termination of work, the Contracting Officer shall pay the Contractor the amounts determined by the Contracting Officer as follows, but without duplication of any amounts agreed on under paragraph (f) of this clause:</P>
                <P>(1) The contract price for completed supplies or services accepted by the Government (or sold or acquired under subparagraph (b)(9) of this clause) not previously paid for, adjusted for any saving of freight and other charges.</P>
                <P>(2) The total of—</P>
                <P>(i) The costs incurred in the performance of the work terminated, including initial costs and preparatory expense allocable thereto, but excluding any costs attributable to supplies or services paid or to be paid under subparagraph (g)(1) of this clause;</P>
                <P>(ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision (g)(2)(i) of this clause; and</P>

                <P>(iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (g)(2)(i) of this clause, determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be fair and reasonable; however, if it appears that the Contractor would have sustained a loss on the entire contract had it been completed, the Contracting Officer shall allow no profit under this subdivision (iii) and shall reduce the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss.<PRTPAGE P="444"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, including—</P>
                <P>(i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and supporting data;</P>
                <P>(ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the amounts of such settlements); and</P>
                <P>(iii) Storage, transportation, and other costs incurred, reasonably necessary for the preservation, protection, or disposition of the termination inventory.</P>
                <P>(h) Except for normal spoilage, and except to the extent that the Government expressly assumed the risk of loss, the Contracting Officer shall exclude from the amounts payable to the Contractor under paragraph (g) of this clause, the fair value as determined by the Contracting Officer, for the loss of the Government property.</P>
                <P>(i) The cost principles and procedures of part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause.</P>
                <P>(j) The Contractor shall have the right of appeal, under the Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (e), (g), or (l) of this clause, except that if the Contractor failed to submit the termination settlement proposal or request for equitable adjustment within the time provided in paragraph (e) or (l), respectively, and failed to request a time extension, there is no right of appeal.</P>
                <P>(k) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, there shall be deducted—</P>
                <P>(1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Contractor under the terminated portion of this contract;</P>
                <P>(2) Any claim which the Government has against the Contractor under this contract; and</P>
                <P>(3) The agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of, materials, supplies, or other things acquired by the Contractor or sold under the provisions of this clause and not recovered by or credited to the Government.</P>
                <P>(l) If the termination is partial, the Contractor may file a proposal with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 90 days from the effective date of termination unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(m)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by the Contractor for the terminated portion of the contract, if the Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed the amount to which the Contractor will be entitled.</P>
                <P>(2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be due, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government upon demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by the Contractor to the date the excess is repaid. Interest shall not be charged on any excess payment due to a reduction in the Contractor's termination settlement proposal because of retention or other disposition of termination inventory until 10 days after the date of the retention or disposition, or a later date determined by the Contracting Officer because of the circumstances.</P>
                <P>(n) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the Contractor shall maintain all records and documents relating to the terminated portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Contractor's costs and expenses under this contract. The Contractor shall make these records and documents available to the Government, at the Contractor's office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records and documents.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Termination for Convenience of the Government (Dismantling, Demolition, or Removal of Improvements) (APR 2012)</HD>
                <P>(a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this contract, in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Contractor a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of termination and the effective date. Upon receipt of the notice, if title to property is vested in the Contractor under this contract, it shall revest in the Government regardless of any other clause of this contract, except for property that the Contractor disposed of by bona fide sale or removed from the site.</P>
                <P>(b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed with the following obligations, regardless of delay in determining or adjusting any amounts due under this clause:</P>
                <P>(1) Stop work as specified in the notice.</P>
                <P>(2) Place no further subcontracts or orders (referred to as subcontracts in this clause) for materials, services, or facilities, except as necessary to complete the continued portion of the contract.</P>
                <P>(3) Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work terminated.</P>

                <P>(4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, all right, title, <PRTPAGE P="446"/>and interest of the Contractor under the subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal arising out of those terminations.</P>
                <P>(5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; the approval or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.</P>
                <P>(6) As directed by the Contracting Officer, transfer title and deliver to the Government (i) the fabricated or unfabricated parts, work in process, completed work, supplies, and other material produced or acquired for the work terminated, and (ii) the completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information, and other property that, if the contract has been completed, would be required to be furnished to the Government.</P>
                <P>(7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.</P>
                <P>(8) Take any action that may be necessary, or that the Contracting Officer may direct, for the protection and preservation of the property related to this contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and in which the Government has or may acquire an interest.</P>

                <P>(9) Use its best efforts to sell, as directed or authorized by the Contracting Officer, any property of the types referred to in subparagraph (b)(6) of this clause; <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that the Contractor (i) is not required to extend credit to any purchaser and (ii) may acquire the property under the conditions prescribed by, and at prices approved by, the Contracting Officer. The proceeds of any transfer or disposition will be applied to reduce any payments to be made by the Government under this contract, credited to the price or cost of the work, or paid in any other manner directed by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(c) The Contractor shall submit complete termination inventory schedules no later than 120 days from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within this 120-day period.</P>
                <P>(d) After expiration of the plant clearance period as defined in subpart 49.001 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Contractor may submit to the Contracting Officer a list, certified as to quantity and quality, of termination inventory not previously disposed of, excluding items authorized for disposition by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request the Government to remove those items or enter into an agreement for their storage. Within 15 days, the Government will accept title to those items and remove them or enter into a storage agreement. The Contracting Officer may verify the list upon removal of the items, or if stored, within 45 days from submission of the list, and shall correct the list, as necessary, before final settlement.</P>
                <P>(e) After termination, the Contractor shall submit a final termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received and acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Contractor fails to submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, due the Contractor because of the termination and shall pay the amount determined.</P>
                <P>(f) Subject to paragraph (e) of this clause, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount to be paid because of the termination. The amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done. However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (f) or paragraph (g) of this clause, exclusive of settlement costs, may not exceed the total contract price as reduced by (1) the amount of payments previously made and (2) the contract price of work not terminated. The contract shall be amended and the Contractor paid the agreed amount. Paragraph (g) of this clause shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon to be paid under this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(g) If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on the whole amount to be paid because of the termination of work, the Contracting Officer shall pay the Contractor the amounts determined by the Contracting Officer as follows, but without duplication of any amounts agreed on under paragraph (f) of this clause:</P>
                <P>(1) For contract work performed before the effective date of termination, the total (without duplication of any items) of—</P>
                <P>(i) The cost of this work;</P>
                <P>(ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the terminated portion of the contract, if not included in subdivision (g)(1)(i) of this clause; and</P>

                <P>(iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (g)(1)(i) of this clause, determined by the Contracting Officer under section 49.202 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be fair and reasonable; however, if it appears that the Contractor would have sustained a loss on the entire contract had it been completed, the Contracting Officer shall allow no profit <PRTPAGE P="447"/>under this subdivision (iii) and shall reduce the amount of the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss.</P>
                <P>(2) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, including—</P>
                <P>(i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and supporting data;</P>
                <P>(ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the amounts of such settlements); and</P>
                <P>(iii) Preservation and protection of property under subparagraph (b)(8) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(h) Except for normal spoilage, and except to the extent that the Government expressly assumed the risk of loss, the Contracting Officer shall exclude from the amounts payable to the Contractor under paragraph (g) of this clause, the fair value, as determined by the Contracting Officer, for the loss of the Government property.</P>
                <P>(i) The cost principles and procedures of part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause.</P>
                <P>(j) The Contractor shall have the right of appeal, under the Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (e), (g), or (l) of this clause, except that if the Contractor failed to submit the termination settlement proposal within the time provided in paragraph (e) or (f) and failed to request a time extension, there is no right of appeal. If the Contracting Officer has made a determination of the amount due under paragraph (e), (g), or (l) of this clause, the Government shall pay the Contractor (1) the amount determined by the Contracting Officer, if there is no right of appeal or if no timely appeal has been taken, or (2) the amount finally determined on an appeal.</P>
                <P>(k) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, there shall be deducted—</P>
                <P>(1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Contractor under the terminated portion of this contract;</P>
                <P>(2) Any claim which the Government has against the Contractor under this contract; and</P>
                <P>(3) The agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of, materials, supplies, or other things acquired by the Contractor or sold under the provisions of this clause and not recovered by or credited to the Government.</P>
                <P>(l) If the termination is partial, the Contractor may file a proposal with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 90 days from the effective date of termination unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(m)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it prescribes, make partial payments and payments against cost incurred by the Contractor for the terminated portion of the contract, if the Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed the amount to which the Contractor will be entitled.</P>
                <P>(2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be due, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government upon demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by the Contractor to the date the excess is repaid. Interest shall not be charged on any excess payment due to a reduction in the Contractor's termination settlement proposal because of retention or other disposition of termination inventory until 10 days after the date of the retention or disposition, or a later date determined by the Contracting Officer because of the circumstances.</P>
                <P>(n) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the Contractor shall maintain all records and documents relating to the terminated portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Contractor's costs and expenses under this contract. The Contractor shall make these records and documents available to the Government, at the Contractor's office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records and documents.</P>

If the Contracting Officer has made a determination of the amount due under paragraph (f), (h) or (l) of this clause, the Government shall pay the Contractor (1) the amount determined by the Contracting Officer if there is no right of appeal or if no timely appeal has been taken, or (2) the amount finally determined on an appeal.</P>

                <P>(l) The Contractor and Contracting Officer must agree to any equitable adjustment in fee for the continued portion of the contract when there is a partial termination. The Contracting Officer shall amend the contract to reflect the agreement.</P>
                <P>(m)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by the Contractor for the terminated portion of the contract, if the Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed the amount to which the Contractor will be entitled.</P>
                <P>(2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be due, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government upon demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by the Contractor to the date the excess is repaid. Interest shall not be charged on any excess payment due to a reduction in the Contractor's termination settlement proposal because of retention or other disposition of termination inventory until 10 days after the date of the retention or disposition, or a later date determined by the Contracting Officer because of the circumstances.</P>
                <P>(n) The provisions of this clause relating to fee are inapplicable if this contract does not include a fee.</P>

It also confers other important benefits. SAFETY Act designation and SAFETY Act certification are designed to support effective technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause, and which also meet other prescribed criteria. For some classes of technologies, DHS may issue a block designation/certification in order to lessen the burdens for filing for SAFETY Act designation or SAFETY Act certifications by not requiring applicants to provide certain information otherwise required and in order to offer expedited review of any application <PRTPAGE P="460"/>submitted pursuant to a block designation/certification.

                <P>(d) All determinations by DHS are based on factors set forth in the SAFETY Act and its implementing regulations. A determination by DHS to issue a SAFETY Act designation, or not to issue a SAFETY Act designation for a particular technology as a QATT is not a determination that the technology meets, or fails to meet, the requirements of any solicitation issued by any Federal, State, local or tribal governments. Determinations by DHS with respect to whether to issue a SAFETY Act designation for technologies submitted for DHS review are based on the factors identified in 6 CFR 25.4(b).</P>

                <P>(e) Neither SAFETY Act designation nor certification is in any way a requirement of this action. Whether to seek the benefits of the SAFETY Act for a proposed product or service is entirely up to the offeror. Additional information about the SAFETY Act and this block designation/certification may be found at the SAFETY Act website at <E T="03">http://www.SAFETYAct.gov</E> or requests may be mailed to: Directorate of Science and Technology, SAFETY Act/Room 4320, Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528.</P>
