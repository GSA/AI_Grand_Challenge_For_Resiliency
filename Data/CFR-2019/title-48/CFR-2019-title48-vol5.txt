      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

      THIS TITLE
      Title 48—Federal Acquisition Regulations System is composed of seven volumes.

The contents of these volumes represent all current regulations codified under this title of the CFR as of October 1, 2019.

      The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal acquisition regulations.
      The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).
      The first volume, containing chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), includes an index to the Federal acquisition regulations.
      For this volume, Robert J. Sheehan, III was Chief Editor. The Code of Federal Regulations publication program is under the direction of John Hyrum Martinez, assisted by Stephen J. Frattini.

              (b) The information requested by the AIDAR sections listed in paragraph (a) is necessary to allow USAID to prudently administer public funds. It lets USAID make reasonable assessments of contractor capabilities and responsibility of costs. Information is required in order for a contractor and/or its employee to obtain a benefit-usually taking the form of payment under a Government contract.
              (c) Public reporting burden for these collections of information is estimated as shown in paragraph (a) of this section. The estimated burden includes the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

              Policy.
              (a) Responsibility. Subject to the direction of the Administrator, the Director, Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance (“M/OAA Director) is responsible for:

              (1) Developing and maintaining necessary uniform procurement policies, procedures, and standards;
              
              (2) Providing assistance to the contracting activities as appropriate;
              (3) Keeping the Administrator and Executive Staff fully informed on procurement matters which should be brought to their attention; and
              (4) All agency head duties and authorities stated in (48 CFR) FAR subpart 1.3, in accordance with (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.601. These responsibilities include but are not limited to developing, issuing, and maintaining the USAID Acquisition Regulation (“AIDAR”, 48 CFR chapter 7), USAID's supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), in coordination with the Office of the General Counsel and such other offices as may be appropriate.
              (b) Applicability. (1) Unless a deviation is specifically authorized in accordance with subpart 701.4, or unless otherwise provided, the FAR and AIDAR apply to all contracts (regardless of currency of payment, or whether funds are appropriated or non-appropriated) to which USAID is a direct party.
              (2) At Missions where joint administrative services are arranged, procuring offices may apply the Department of State Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 6) for all administrative and technical support contracts except in defined areas. The Bureau for Management, Office of Management Services (M/MS) will furnish the defined areas and administrative guidelines for procurement to the overseas Missions. Administrative and local support services include the procurement accountability, maintenance and disposal of all office and residential equipment and furnishings, vehicles and expendable supplies purchased with administrative and/or technical support funds, either dollars or local currency.

              Publication and codification.
              (a) The AIDAR is USAID's Acquisition Regulation supplementing the FAR (48 CFR chapter 1) and is published as chapter 7 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations. AIDAR Circulars shall be used to promulgate changes to the AIDAR and shall be published in compliance with (48 CFR) FAR part 1.
              (b) Appendices. Significant procurement policies and procedures that do not correspond to or conveniently fit into the FAR system described in FAR subpart 1.1 and 1.303 may be published as Appendices to the AIDAR. Appendices follow the main text of the AIDAR in a section entitled “Appendices to Chapter 7” and contain a table of contents and the individual appendices identified by letter and subject title (e.g., “Appendix D—Direct USAID Contracts with a U.S. Citizen or a U.S. Resident Alien for Personal Services Abroad”).
              (c) Only the M/OAA Director has the authority to issue internal Agency guidance applicable to all Agency contracts. The heads of the various Agency contracting activities (see Subparts 701.6 and 702.170) may issue operating instructions and procedures consistent with the FAR, AIDAR, and other Agency regulations, policies, and procedures for application within their organizations. One copy of each such issuance must be forwarded to the Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Policy Division (M/OAA/P). Insofar as possible, such material must be numerically keyed to the AIDAR.

              Policy.
              It is USAID policy to approve deviations from the mandatory requirements of the FAR and AIDAR only if it is essential to effect necessary procurement actions and when special and exceptional circumstances make such deviation clearly in the best interest of the Government.

              Procedure.
              (a) Deviation from the FAR or AIDAR affecting one contract or transaction. (1) Deviations which affect only one contract or procurement will be made only after prior approval by the head of the contracting activity. Deviation requests containing the information listed in paragraph (c) of this section shall be submitted sufficiently in advance of the effective date of such deviation to allow adequate time for consideration and evaluation by the head of the contracting activity.
              (2) Requests for such deviations may be initiated by the responsible USAID contracting officer who must obtain clearance and approvals as may be required by the head of the contracting activity. Prior to submission of the deviation request to the head of the contracting activity for approval, the contracting officer must obtain written comments from the Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Policy Division (M/OAA/P), hereinafter referred to as “M/OAA/P”. M/OAA/P will normally be allowed 10 working days prior to the submission of the deviation request to the head of the contracting activity to review the request and to submit comments. If the exigency of the situation requires more immediate action, the requesting office may arrange with M/OAA/P for a shorter review period. In addition to a copy of the deviation request, M/OAA/P must be furnished any background or historical data that will contribute to a more complete understanding of the deviation. The comments of M/OAA/P must be made a part of the deviation request file, which is forwarded to the head of the contracting activity.
              (3) Coordination with the Office of the General Counsel, as appropriate, should also be effected prior to approval of a deviation by the head of the contracting activity.
              (b) Class deviations from the FAR or AIDAR. Class deviations are those which affect more than one contract or contractor.
              (1) Class deviations from the AIDAR will be processed in the same manner as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. Individual heads of contracting activities have authority to approve class deviations affecting only contracts within their own contracting activities, except that the Director, M/OAA, has authority to approve class deviations that affect more than one contracting activity.
              (2) Class deviations from the FAR will be considered jointly by USAID and the Chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (C/CAAC) (FAR 1.404) unless, in the judgment of the head of the contracting activity, after due consideration of the objective of uniformity, circumstances preclude such consultation. The head of the contracting activity must certify on the face of the deviation the reason for not coordinating with the C/CAAC. In such cases, M/OAA/P will be responsible for notifying the C/CAAC of the class deviation.
              (3) Class deviations from the FAR shall be processed as follows:
              (i) The request must be processed in the same manner as paragraph (a) of this section, except that M/OAA/P will be allowed 15 working days, prior to the submission of the deviation request to the head of the contracting activity, to effect the necessary coordination with the C/CAAC and to submit comments. If the exigency of the situation requires more immediate action, the requesting office may arrange with M/OAA/P for a shorter review and coordination period. The comments of C/CAAC and M/OAA/P must be forwarded to the head of the contracting activity along with the deviation request and made a part of the deviation request file.
              (ii) The request shall be processed in the same manner as paragraph (a) of this section if the request is not being jointly considered by USAID and the C/CAAC.
              (4) Deviations involving basic agreements or other master type contracts are considered to involve more than one contract.
              (5) Unless the approval is sooner rescinded, class deviations shall expire 2 years from the date of approval provided that deviation authority shall continue to apply to contracts or task orders which are active at the time the class deviation expires. Authority to continue the use of such deviation beyond 2 years may be requested in accordance with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.

              (6) Expiration dates shall be shown on all class deviations.
              
              (c) Requests for deviation shall contain a complete description of the deviation, the effective date of the deviation, the circumstances in which the deviation will be used, a specific reference to the regulation being deviated from, an indication as to whether any identical or similar deviations have been approved in the past, a complete justification of the deviation including any added or decreased cost to the Government, the name of the contractor, and the contract or task order number.
              (d) Register of deviations. Separate registers must be maintained by the procuring activities of the deviations granted from the FAR and AIDAR. Each deviation must be recorded in its appropriate register and be assigned a control number as follows: For USAID Washington deviations the symbol of the procuring activity, or for overseas mission deviations the relevant geographic code; the abbreviation “DEV”; the fiscal year; the type of deviation (from the FAR or AIDAR); the serial number [issued in consecutive order during each fiscal year] assigned to the particular deviation; and the suffix “c” if it is a class deviation (e.g., M/OAA-DEV-FAR-14-1, M/OAA-DEV-FAR-14-2c, 123-DEV-AIDAR-14-1). The control number must be embodied in the document authorizing the deviation and must be cited in all references to the deviation.
              (e) Central record of deviations. Copies of approved deviations shall be furnished promptly to the M/OAA/P, who shall be responsible for maintaining a central record of all deviations that are granted.
              (f) Semiannual report of class deviations. (1) USAID contracting officers must submit a semiannual report to M/OAA/P of all contract actions effected under class deviations to the FAR and AIDAR, which have been approved pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
              (2) The report shall contain the applicable deviation control number, the contractor's name, contract number and task order number (if appropriate).
              (3) The report shall cover the 6-month periods ending June 30 and December 31, respectively, and shall be submitted within 20 working days after the end of the reporting period.

              701.601
              General.
              (a)(1) Pursuant to the delegations in USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 103, the M/OAA Director is authorized to act as the head of the agency for all purposes described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR, 48 CFR chapter 1), except for the authority in (48 CFR) FAR 6.302-7(a)(2), 6.302-7(c)(1), 17.602(a), 19.201(c), 27.306(a), 27.306(b), and 30.201-5, or where the “head of the agency” authority is expressly not delegable under the FAR or AIDAR. Further, the M/OAA Director is responsible for implementing the procurement related aspects of the Foreign Assistance Act, Executive Order 11223, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, and other statutory and Executive Branch procurement policies and requirements applicable to USAID operations, including those authorities and responsibilities delegated to the Senior Procurement Executive as specified in USAID's internal delegations found in the ADS.
              (2) The M/OAA Director has specific authority to:
              (i) Select and appoint contracting officers and terminate their appointments in accordance with section 1.603 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and
              (ii) Exercise in person or by delegation the authorities stated in subpart 1.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation with regard to deviations from that regulation.

              (b) Except as otherwise prescribed, the head of each contracting activity (as defined in 702.170) is responsible for the procurement of supplies and services under or assigned to the procurement cognizance of his or her activity. The heads of USAID contracting activities are vested with broad authority to carry out the programs and activities for which they are responsible. This authority includes authority to execute contracts and the establishment of procurement policies, procedures, and standards appropriate for their programs and activities, subject to Government-wide and USAID requirements and restrictions, such as those found at (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.601 and particularly 701.603-70, the USAID policy regarding the direct-hire status of contracting officers.
              (c) The authority of heads of contracting activities to execute contracts is limited as follows:
              (1) Director, the Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance, the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (DCHA/OFDA). Authority to execute contracts for disaster relief purposes during the first 72 hours of a disaster in a cumulative total amount not to exceed $500,000. Authority to execute simplified acquisitions up to $50,000 at any time. May issue warrants for simplified acquisitions up to $50,000 to qualified individuals on his or her staff.
              (2) Director, Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment, Office of Education (E3/ED). Authority to execute simplified acquisitions up to $10,000. Unlimited authority for procuring participant training based on published catalog prices. May issue warrants for simplified acquisitions up to $10,000 to qualified individuals on his or her staff.
              (3) Overseas heads of contracting activities. Authority to sign contracts where the cumulative amount of the contract, as amended, does not exceed $1,000,000 (or local currency equivalent) for personal services contracts; or the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in (48 CFR) FAR 2.101 (or local currency equivalent) for all other contracts. May issue warrants for simplified acquisitions up to $50,000 to qualified individuals on his or her staff.

The negotiated settlement or final decision will be final, subject only to a contractor's appeal under the provisions of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613), or other procedures as applicable. Policies and procedures for resolving audit recommendations are in accordance with USAID's internal policies found in ADS Chapters 591 and 592.

It contains six functional series, valid USAID Handbook chapters, a resource library, and a glossary. References to “ADS” throughout 48 CFR chapter 7 are references to the Automated Directives System. The entire ADS is accessible to the general public at the following USAID Internet address: http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/.

              (b) If the contract requires the contractor (or contractor employees) to have routine physical access to USAID-controlled facilities in the U.S. (i.e., will need an ID for regular entry to USAID space), or have logical access to USAID's information systems (i.e., access to AIDNet, Phoenix, the Global Acquisition and Assistance System (GLAAS,) etc.,) and the solicitation and contract contains (48 CFR) FAR 52.204-9(a), the contracting officer must also insert (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.204-72, Access to USAID Facilities and USAID's Information Systems. Only U.S citizen employees or consultants of a U.S.-based company may request routine physical access to USAID-controlled facilities or logical access to USAID's information systems.

              704.7001
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures to apply partner vetting to USAID acquisitions.
            
            
              704.7002
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              
                Key individual means:
              (1) Principal officers of the organization's governing body (e.g., chairman, vice chairman, treasurer and secretary of the board of directors or board of trustees);
              (2) The principal officer and deputy principal officer of the organization (e.g., executive director, deputy director, president, vice president);
              (3) The program manager or chief of party for the USG-financed program; and
              (4) Any other person with significant responsibilities for administration of the USG-financed activities or resources, such as key personnel as described in Automated Directives System Chapter 302. Key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the prime contractor, must be vetted.
              
                Vetting official means the USAID employee identified in the solicitation or contract as having responsibility for receiving vetting information, responding to questions about information to be included on the Partner Information Form, coordinating with the USAID Office of Security (SEC), and conveying the vetting determination to each offeror, potential subcontractors subject to vetting, and the contracting officer. The vetting official is not part of the contracting office and has no involvement in the source selection process.
            
            
              704.7003
              Policy.
              In the interest of national security, USAID may determine that a particular acquisition is subject to vetting. In that case, USAID will require vetting of all key individuals of offerors, first tier subcontractors, and any other class of subcontracts if identified in the solicitation and resulting contract. When USAID conducts partner vetting, it will not award a contract to any offeror who does not pass vetting.
            
            
              704.7004
              Procedures.
            
            
              704.7004-1
              Preaward requirements.
              (a) When USAID determines an acquisition to be subject to vetting, the contracting officer determines the appropriate stage of the acquisition cycle to require offerors to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified in the solicitation. The contracting officer must specify in the solicitation the stage at which the offerors will be required to submit the USAID Partner Information Form.
              (b) For negotiated procurements using (48 CFR) FAR part 15, this stage will typically be when the contracting officer establishes the competitive range (48 CFR 15.306(c)). However, the contracting officer may determine that vetting is more appropriate at a different stage of the source selection process, such as immediately prior to award, and then require only the apparently successful offeror to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form.
              (c) For Indefinite Delivery contracts under (48 CFR) FAR subpart 16.5, vetting will occur prior to award of the basic contract if the contracting officer anticipates placing orders subject to vetting under that contract. Vetting will also occur before USAID places any orders subject to vetting. The contracting officer will notify awardees of the appropriate timing for vetting in the request for task or delivery order proposals. See (48 CFR) AIDAR subpart 716.5 for vetting procedures for task and delivery orders.
              (d) For all other acquisitions, including those under (48 CFR) FAR parts 13 and 14, the contracting officer determines the appropriate time to require potential awardee(s) to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official.
              (e) Source selection proceeds separately from vetting. The source selection authority makes the source selection determination separately from the vetting process and without knowledge of vetting-related information other than that the apparently successful offeror has passed or not passed vetting.
              (f) The contracting officer may only award to an offeror who has passed vetting.

              704.7004-2
              Post award requirements.
              (a) For those contracts and task orders the Agency has determined are subject to vetting, the contractor must submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form any time it changes:
              (1) Key individuals, and
              (2) Subcontractors for which vetting is required.
              (b) USAID may vet key individuals of the contractor and any required subcontractors periodically during contract performance using the information already submitted on the Form.

              704.7004-3
              Subcontracts.
              (a) When the prime contract is subject to vetting, vetting is required for key individuals of all subcontracts under that contract for which consent is required under (48 CFR) FAR clause 52.244-2, Subcontracts.
              (b) The contracting officer must not consent to a subcontract with any subcontractor subject to vetting until that subcontractor has passed vetting.

              (c) Vetting may be required for key individuals of subcontracts at any tier for certain classes of items (supplies and services). The contracting officer must identify these classes of items in the solicitation.
              (d) The contractor may instruct prospective subcontractors who are subject to vetting to submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official as soon as the contractor submits the USAID Partner Information Form for its key individuals.

              Solicitation provision and contract clause.
              (a) The contracting officer will insert the provision at 752.204-70 Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements, in all solicitations USAID identifies as subject to vetting.
              (b) Except for awards made under FAR part 16, the contracting officer will—
              (1) Insert the clause at 752.204-71 Partner Vetting, in all solicitations and contracts USAID identifies as subject to vetting, or
              (2) Use the clause with its Alternate I when USAID determines that subcontracts at any tier for certain classes of supplies or services are subject to vetting.
              (c) For awards made under FAR part 16, see (48 CFR) AIDAR subpart 716.5.

              (2) Full and open competition need not be obtained when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purposes of foreign aid, relief, and rehabilitation.
              (b) Application. This authority may be used for:
              (1) An award under section 636(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, involving a personal services contractor serving abroad;
              (2) An award of $250,000 or less by an overseas contracting activity;

              (3)(i) An award for which the Assistant Administrator responsible for the project or program makes a formal written determination, with supporting findings, that compliance with full and open competition procedures would impair foreign assistance objectives, and would be inconsistent with the fulfillment of the foreign assistance program; or
              (ii) Awards for countries, regions, projects, or programs for which the Administrator of USAID makes a formal written determination, with supporting findings, that compliance with full and open competition procedures would impair foreign assistance objectives, and would be inconsistent with the fulfillment of the foreign assistance program.
              (4) Awards under (48 CFR) AIDAR 715.370-1 (Title XII selection procedure—general) or 715.370-2 (Title XII selection procedure—collaborative assistance).
              (5) An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays.
              (c) Limitations. (1) Proposals must be requested from as many potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances. Additionally, as required in (48 CFR) FAR 5.201, the contracting officer must publicize the intended award when using the exceptions above, including when using the authority at 706.302-70(b)(5) where the contracting officer has determined that the incumbent contractor is the only practicable, potential offeror.
              (2) The contract file must include appropriate explanation and support justifying the award without full and open competition, as provided in (48 CFR) FAR 6.303, except that determinations made under 706.302-70(b)(3) will not be subject to the requirement for contracting officer certification or to approvals in accord with (48 CFR) FAR 6.304.
              (3) The authority in 706.302-70(b)(3)(i) shall be used only when no other authority provided in (48 CFR) FAR 6.302 or (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302 is suitable. The specific foreign assistance objective which would be impaired must be identified and explained in the written determination and finding. Prior consultation with the Agency Competition Advocate (see 706.501) is required before executing the written determination and finding, and this consultation must be reflected in the determination and finding.
              (4) Use of the authority in 706.302-70(b)(5) for proposed follow-on amendments in excess of one year or over $250,000 is subject to the approval of the Agency Competition Advocate. For all other follow-on amendments using this authority, the contracting officer's certification required in (48 CFR) FAR 6.303-2(b)(12) will serve as approval.

              The USAID Administrator delegated the authority to designate the Agency Competition Advocate and a competition advocate for each agency procuring activity (see 702.170 of this chapter) to the M/OAA Director. The M/OAA Director, under the Administrator's delegation, has designated the M/OAA Deputy Director for Accountability, Compliance, Transparency, and Support as the Agency Competition Advocate and the deputy head of each contracting activity as the competition advocate for each activity. The competition advocate for USAID/W is the Deputy Director for M/OAA Operations. If there is no deputy, the head of the contracting activity is designated the competition advocate for that activity. The competition advocate's duties may not be redelegated, but can be exercised by persons serving as acting deputy (or acting head) of the contracting activity. For definitions of contracting activity and head of the contracting activity, see 702.170 of this chapter.

            Metric system waivers.
            (a) Criteria. The (48 CFR) FAR 11.002(b) requirement to use the metric system of measurement for specifications and quantitative data that are incorporated in or required by USAID contracts may be waived when USAID determines in writing that such usage is impractical or is likely to cause U.S. firms to experience significant inefficiencies or the loss of markets.
            (b) Authorization. (1) The USAID Metric Executive (as designated in ADS Chapter 323), the contracting officer, and the USAID official who approves the procurement requirement are authorized to waive the metric requirement for one of the above reasons. The USAID Metric Executive is authorized to overrule a decision to grant a waiver, or to nullify a blanket waiver made by another approving official so long as a contractor's rights under an executed contract are not infringed upon.
            (2) A blanket waiver for a class of multiple transactions may be issued for a term not to exceed three years.
            (3) When a waiver will be based upon the adverse impact on U.S. firms, clearance from the USAID Metric Executive and the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) will be obtained prior to authorization.
            (c) Records and reporting. (1) The basis for each waiver and any plans to adapt similar requirements to metric specifications in future procurements should be documented in the contract file.
            (2) Each procurement activity will maintain a log of the waivers from the metric requirements which are authorized for its procurements. The logs shall list the commodity/service being procured, total dollar value of the procured item(s), waiver date, authorizing official, basis for waiver, and USAID actions that can promote metrication and lessen the need for future waivers.
            (3) Within 30 days of the closing of each fiscal year, each USAID/W procurement activity and each Mission will submit a copy of the metric waiver log for the year to the USAID Metric Executive. (Mission logs are to be consolidated in a Mission report for the procurement activity and for the nonprocurement activities maintaining such logs under the USAID Metric Transition Plan.) Repetitive purchases of commercially produced and marketed items and classes of items may be consolidated in reporting procurements that do not exceed $10,000 cumulatively during the reporting period.

              (a) Establishment and composition of USAID evaluation committees. A technical evaluation committee shall be established for each proposed procurement. In each case, the committee shall be composed of a chair representing the cognizant technical office, a representative of the contracting office (who shall be a non-voting member of the committee), and representatives from other concerned offices as appropriate.
              (b) Technical evaluation procedures. (1) The contracting officer will receive all proposals and provide to the chair a listing and copies of the technical proposals and instructions for conducting the evaluation.
              (2) The chair will promptly call a meeting of the committee to evaluate the proposals received. The evaluation shall be based on the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation document.
              (3) The chair shall prepare and provide to the contracting officer written documentation summarizing the results of the evaluation of each proposal, including an assessment of past performance information in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR 15.305(a)(2). The documentation shall include narrative justification of the evaluation results.
              (4) The contracting officer is responsible for reviewing the documentation justifying the evaluation results to determine that it is adequate and complete. The contracting officer shall return a justification determined to be inadequate to the chair for revision.
              (5) No member of the USAID evaluation committee shall hold discussions with any offeror before or during the USAID evaluation committee's proceedings, nor shall any information about the proposals be provided to anyone not on the committee without first obtaining the contracting officer's consent.

              (c) The contracting officer may authorize release of proposals outside the Government for evaluation—
              (1) When an Evaluation Assistance Contract (EAC) is required to provide technical advisory or other services relating to the evaluation of proposals; or
              (2) When an individual other than a Government employee, known as a Non-Government Evaluator (NGE), is selected to serve as a member of a USAID technical evaluation committee.
              (3) Prior to releasing the proposals outside the Government, the contracting officer must obtain a signed and dated agreement from each NGE and EAC employee that they will safeguard the proposals and information in the proposals and that they perceive no actual or potential conflict of interests. (An example of such agreement is provided in the ADS).

              Title XII selection procedure—general.
              (a) General. The Deputy Administrator has determined, as provided in (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(3)(ii) that use of this Title XII source selection procedure is necessary so as not to impair or affect USAID's ability to administer Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act. This determination is reflected in (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(4). This constitutes authority for other than full and open competition when selecting Title XII institutions to perform Title XII projects.
              (b) Scope of subsection. This subsection prescribes policies and procedures for the selection of institutions eligible under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to perform activities authorized under Title XII.
              (c) Applicability. The provisions of this subsection are applicable when the project office certifies that the activity is authorized under Title XII, and determines that use of the Title XII selection procedure is appropriate.
              (d) Solicitation, evaluation, and selection procedures. (1) Competition shall be sought among eligible Title XII institutions to the maximum practicable extent; this requirement shall be deemed satisfied when a contractor is selected under the procedures of this subsection.
              (2) The project office shall—
              (i) Prepare selection criteria for evaluation of eligible institutions for use in preparing the source list, determining predominantly qualified sources, and selecting the contractor;
              (ii) Prepare an initial list of eligible institutions considered qualified to perform the proposed activity;
              (iii) Provide a statement describing qualifications and areas of expertise considered essential, a statement of work, estimate of personnel requirements, special requirements (logistic support, Government furnished property, and so forth) for the contracting officer's use in preparing the request for technical proposal (RFTP).
              (iv) Send a memorandum incorporating the certification and determination required by paragraph (c) of this section, together with the information required by paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, with the “Action” copy of the requisition to the contracting officer, requesting him/her to prepare and distribute the RFTP.
              (3) Upon receipt and acceptance of the project officer's request, the contracting officer shall prepare the RFTP. The RFTP shall contain sufficient information to enable an offeror to submit a responsive and complete technical proposal. This includes a definitive statement of work, an estimate of the personnel required, and special provisions (such as logistic support, Government furnished equipment, and so forth), a proposed contract format, and evaluation criteria. No cost or pricing data will be requested or required by the RFTP. The RFTP will be distributed to the eligible institutions recommended by the project office. The RFTP will be synopsized, as required by (48 CFR) FAR 5.201, and will normally allow a minimum of 60 days for preparation and submission of a proposal.
              (4) Upon receipt of responses to the RFTP by the contracting officer, an evaluation committee will be established as provided for in 715.303-70.
              (5) The evaluation committee will evaluate all proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFTP, and will prepare a selection memorandum which shall:
              (i) State the evaluation criteria;
              (ii) List all of the eligible institutions whose proposals were reviewed;
              (iii) Report on the ranking and rationale therefor for all proposals;
              (iv) Indicate the eligible institution or institutions considered best qualified.
              (6) The evaluation committee will submit the selection memorandum to the contracting officer for review and approval.

              (7) The contracting officer will either approve the selection memorandum, or return it to the evaluation committee for reconsideration for specified reasons.
              (8) If the selection memorandum is approved, the contracting officer shall obtain cost, pricing, and other necessary data from the recommended institution or institutions and shall conduct negotiations. If a satisfactory contract cannot be obtained, the contracting officer will so advise the evaluation committee. The evaluation committee may then recommend an alternate institution or institutions.

              Title XII selection procedure—collaborative assistance.
              (a) General. (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(4) provides authority for other than full and open competition when selecting Title XII institutions to perform Title XII activities.
              (b) Scope of subsection. This subsection prescribes policies and procedures for the selection of institutions eligible under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to perform activities authorized under Title XII, where USAID has determined, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this subsection, that use of the collaborative assistance contracting system is appropriate. See (48 CFR) AIDAR appendix F (of this chapter)—Use of Collaborative Assistance Method for Title XII Activities for a more complete definition and discussion of the collaborative assistance method.
              (c) Determinations. The following findings and determinations must be made prior to initiating any contract actions under the collaborative assistance method:
              (1) The cognizant technical office makes a preliminary finding that an activity:
              (i) Is authorized by Title XII; and
              (ii) Should be classed as collaborative assistance because a continuing collaborative relationship between USAID, the host country, and the contractor is required from design through completion of the activity, and USAID, host country, and contractor participation in a continuing review and evaluation of the activity is essential for its proper execution.
              (2) Based upon this preliminary finding, the cognizant technical office shall establish an evaluation panel consisting of a representative of the cognizant technical office as chairman, a representative of the contracting officer, and any other representatives considered appropriate by the chairman to review the proposed activity for its appropriateness under the collaborative assistance method.
              (3) If supported by the panel's findings, the chairman will make a formal written determination that the collaborative assistance method is the appropriate contracting method for the Title XII activity in question.
              (d) Evaluation and selection. (1) Competition shall be sought among eligible Title XII institutions to the maximum practicable extent; this requirement shall be deemed satisfied when a contractor is selected under the procedures of this section.
              (2) The evaluation panel shall:
              (i) Prepare evaluation and selection criteria;
              (ii) Prepare an initial source list of eligible institutions considered qualified to perform the proposed project; and
              (iii) Evaluate the list, using the evaluation criteria previously determined, for the purpose of making a written determination of the sources considered most capable of performing the project.
              (3) The chairman of the evaluation panel will prepare a memorandum requesting the contracting officer to prepare a request for expressions of interest from qualified sources and setting forth:
              (i) The formal determinations required by paragraph (c) of this section;
              (ii) The evaluation criteria which have been determined; and
              (iii) The recommended source list and the rationale therefor.

              (4) The contracting officer will prepare a request for an expression of interest (REI), containing sufficient information to permit an offeror to determine its interest in the project, and to discuss the project with USAID representatives, if appropriate. The REI should include a concise statement of the purpose of the activity, any special conditions or qualifications considered important, a brief description of the selection procedure and evaluation criteria which will be used, the proposed contract format, and any other information considered appropriate. The REI will be issued to the sources recommended by the panel, and to others, as appropriate; it will be synopsized, as required by (48 CFR) FAR 5.201, and it will normally allow a minimum of 60 days for preparation of an expression of interest. Guidelines for preparation of expressions of interest are contained in attachment 1 to (48 CFR) AIDAR appendix F.
              (5) The contracting officer will transmit all expressions of interest to the evaluation panel for evaluation and selection recommendation. The panel may conduct on site evaluations at its discretion, as part of the evaluation process.
              (6) The chairman of the evaluation panel will prepare a written selection recommendation with supporting justification, recommending that negotiations be conducted with the prospective contractor(s) selected by the evaluation panel. The selection recommendation shall be transmitted to the contracting officer together with the complete official file on the project which was being maintained by the evaluation panel.
              (7) The contracting officer will review the selection recommendation, obtain necessary cost and other data, and proceed to negotiate with the recommended sources.

              Policy.
              (a) USAID encourages the submission of unsolicited proposals which contribute new ideas consistent with and contributing to the accomplishment of the Agency's objectives. However, the requirements for contractor resources are normally quite program specific, and thus widely varied, and must be responsive to host country needs. Further, USAID's projects are usually designed in collaboration with the cooperating country. These factors can limit both the need for, and USAID's ability to use unsolicited proposals. Therefore, prospective offerors are encouraged to contact USAID to determine the Agency's technical and geographical requirements as related to the offeror's interests before preparing and submitting a formal unsolicited proposal.
              (b) USAID's basic policies and procedures regarding unsolicited proposals are those established in FAR subpart 15.6 and this subpart.
              (c) For detailed information on unsolicited proposals including point of contact information see (48 CFR) AIDAR 715.604.

              Partner vetting—indefinite-delivery contracts.
              If a task order or delivery order under an indefinite-delivery contract has the potential to be subject to vetting, then the contract itself will be subject to the applicable procedures and requirements for partner vetting in (48 CFR) AIDAR 704.70.
            
            
              716.505-70
              Partner vetting—orders under indefinite delivery contracts.
              (a) The task order contracting officer will specify in the request for task or delivery order proposals whether the order is subject to vetting and when awardees must submit the USAID Partner Information Form.
              (b) For orders under multiple award contracts, fair opportunity selection procedures are conducted separately from vetting. The contracting officer for the order must follow the ordering procedures in the contract to select the order awardee without knowledge of vetting-related information, other than that the contractor has passed or not passed vetting.
              (c) The contracting officer may only place an order subject to vetting with an awardee that has passed vetting for that order.
            
            
              716.506
              Solicitation provision and contract clause.
              (a) As prescribed in 48 CFR 704.7005(a), the contracting officer will insert the provision at 752.204-70 Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements, in solicitations for indefinite delivery contracts when USAID anticipates that any orders placed under the contract will be subject to vetting.

              (b)(1) The contracting officer will insert the clause at 752.216-71 Partner Vetting, in those solicitations and contracts for indefinite-delivery contracts that USAID identifies as subject to vetting.
              (2) The contracting officer will use the clause with its Alternate I when USAID determines that subcontracts at any tier for certain classes of supplies or services are subject to vetting.

              719.270
              Small business policies.
              (a) In keeping with section 602 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2352), as amended, USAID shall, insofar as practicable and to the maximum extent consistent with the accomplishment of the purposes of said Act, assist U.S. small businesses to participate equitably in the furnishing of supplies and services for Foreign Assistance activities.
              (b) It is the policy of USAID to:
              (1) Fully endorse and carry out the Government's small business program for placing a fair proportion of its purchases and contracts for supplies, construction (including maintenance and repair), research and development, and services (including personal, professional, and technical services) with small business, including minority small business concerns; and
              (2) Increase their participation in USAID procurement.
              (c) In furtherance of this policy:
              (1) Contracting officer's representatives shall make positive efforts (see 719.271-5) to identify potentially qualified small and minority business firms during precontract development of activities and shall, with the responsible contracting officers, assure that such firms are given full opportunity to participate equitably;
              (2) Small business set-asides shall be made for all contracts to be executed in USAID/Washington which qualify for small business set-aside action under part 19 of the (48 CFR) FAR; and
              (3) Consideration shall be given in appropriate cases to the award of the contract to the Small Business Administration for subcontracting to small business firms pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).
              (d) This program shall be implemented by all USAID/Washington contracting activities in order to attain these policy objectives. In accordance with 719.271, all USAID/Washington direct-procurement requirements which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold shall be screened for small business opportunities by the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) except those exempted by 719.271-6(a).

              (e) Where practicable and desirable, small business and minority business enterprise award goals will be established for the respective USAID/Washington procuring activities to provide incentive for contracting personnel to increase awards to small firms. The goals will be set by OSDBU after consultation with the respective head of the contracting activity (see 702-170).
              (f) In the event of a disagreement between OSDBU and the contracting officer concerning: (1) A recommended set-aside, or (2) a request for modification or withdrawal of a class or individual set-aside, complete documentation of the case including the reasons for disagreement shall be transmitted within five working days to the head of the contracting activity (see 719.271-6(e)) for a decision. Procurement action shall be suspended pending a decision.
              (g) The above suspension shall not apply where the contracting officer:
              (1) Certifies in writing, with supporting information, that in order to protect the public interest award must be made without delay;
              (2) Promptly provides a copy of said certification to OSDBU; and
              (3) Includes a copy of the certification in the contract file.
              (h) OSDBU shall be the Small Business Advisor and Minority Business Procurement Policy Manager for all USAID/Washington procuring activities.
              (i) The details on the Agency's direction and operation of the small business program are set forth in 719.271.
              (j) No decision rendered, or action taken, under the coverage set forth in 719.271 shall preclude the Small Business Administration from appealing directly to the USAID Administrator as provided for in part 19 of the FAR.

              The purpose of this section is to prescribe responsibilities and procedures for carrying out the small business program policy set forth in 219.270, and in part 19 of the (48 CFR) FAR. Small business concerns are defined in (48 CFR) FAR subpart 19.1; in addition, small business concerns are concerns organized for profit.

              (5) Cooperating with contracting officers in administering the performance of contractors subject to the Small Business and Minority Business Enterprises Subcontracting Program clauses;
              (6) Developing a plan of operation designed to increase the share of contracts awarded to small business concerns, including small minority business enterprises;

              (7) Establishing small business class set-aside for types and classes of items of services where appropriate;
              
              (8) Reviewing each procurement requisition to make certain individual or class set-asides are initiated on all suitable USAID/Washington proposed contract actions in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold which are subject to screening (see 719.271-6);
              (9) Maintaining a program designed to:
              (i) Locate capable small business sources for current and future procurements through GSA and other methods;

              (11) Recommending that portions of large planned procurements or suitable components of end items or services be purchased separately so small firms may compete;
              (12) On proposed non-competitive procurements, recommending to the contracting officer that the procurement be made competitive when, in the opinion of OSDBU, there are small business or minority business enterprises believed competent to furnish the required goods or services, and supplying the contracting officer a list of such firms;
              (13) Assisting small business concerns with individual problems;
              (14) Promoting increased awareness by the technical staff of the availability of small business firms;

              With respect to procurement activities within their jurisdiction, contracting officers are responsible for:
              (a) Being thoroughly familiar with part 19 of the (48 CFR) FAR and this section dealing with the small business program;
              (b) Screening abstracts of bids and other award data to determine set-aside potential for future procurements;

              (h) Taking action to assure that unnecessary qualifications, restrictive specifications or other features (such as inadequate procurement lead time) of the programming or procurement process which may prevent small business participation in the competitive process are modified to permit such participation where an adequate product or service can be obtained;

              Heads of contracting activities.
              In order for the Agency small business program to be effective, the active support of top management is required. The heads of the contracting activities shall be responsible for:

              (b) Consulting with OSDBU in establishing small business and minority business enterprise award goals, where practicable and desirable; and

              Since the procurement process starts with the establishment of a requirement, the actions of the Contracting officer's representatives can affect the opportunity of small business to participate equitably; therefore, each contracting officer's representative shall, during the formulation of activities which will require contractual implementation:
              (a) Consult with OSDBU on the availability and capabilities of small business firms to permit making a tentative set-aside determination where appropriate; and
              (b) Provide sufficient procurement lead time in the activity implementation schedule to allow potential small business participation.

              719.271-6
              Small business screening procedure.
              (a) General. All USAID/Washington proposed contract actions in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold shall be screened by OSDBU, with the exception of:
              (1) Class set-asides and those unilaterally set-aside by contracting officers (719.271-3(f));
              (2) Those where the contracting officer certifies in writing that the public exigency will not permit the delay incident to screening (719.271-7(b));
              (3) “Institution building” contracts (contracts for development of a counterpart capability in the host country) with educational or nonprofit institutions; or collaborative assistance contracts pursuant to (48 CFR) AIDAR 715.370-2.
              (4) Those involving the payment of tuition and fees for participant training at academic institutions; and
              (5) Personal services contract requirements (see 719.270).
              (b) Preparation of Form USAID 1410-14 (the Small Business/Minority Business Enterprise Procurement Review Form). (1) The contracting officer shall prepare the subject form in an original and 3 copies and forward the original and 2 copies to OSDBU within one working day of receipt by the contracting activity of a procurement requisition.
              (2) The contracting officer will attach to his/her transmittal a complete copy of the procurement request and a copy of the recommended source list as furnished by the technical office and supplemented by him/her.

              (3) The contracting officer shall complete blocks 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 (when appropriate) prior to submittal to OSDBU.
              
              (c) Screening of Form USAID 1410-14 by OSDBU. (1) OSDBU will screen the contracting officer's recommendations on set-aside potential, small business subcontracting opportunities, and section 8(a) subcontracting, and furnish him/her with either a written concurrence in his/her recommendations or written counter-recommendations on the original and duplicate copy within five working days from receipt of the form from the contracting officer.
              (2) OSDBU will complete Blocks 1, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 (when appropriate) prior to returning the screened form to the contracting officer.
              (d) Concurrence or rejection procedure. (1) The contracting officer shall complete Block 13 upon receipt of the original and duplicate copy of the screened form from OSDBU.
              (2) If the contracting officer rejects the OSDBU counter-recommendation, he/she shall return the original and duplicate forms with his/her written reasons for rejection to OSDBU within two working days.
              (3) Upon receipt of the contracting officer's rejection, OSDBU may: (i) accept, or (ii) appeal, the rejection. In the case of acceptance of the contracting officer's rejection, OSDBU shall annotate Block 14 when it renders a decision and return the original form to the contracting officer within two working days.
              (e) Appeal procedure.

              The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mentor-Protégé Program.
            
            
              719.273-1
              Purpose.
              The USAID Mentor-Protégé Program is designed to assist small business, including veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small socially and economically disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business in enhancing their capabilities to perform contracts and sub-contracts for USAID and other Federal agencies. The Mentor-Protégé Program is also designed to improve the performance of USAID contractors and subcontractors by providing developmental assistance to Protégé entities, fostering the establishment of long-term business relationships between small business and prime contractors, and increasing the overall number of small business that receive USAID contract and subcontract awards. A firm's status as a Protégé under a USAID contract shall not have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.
            
            
              719.273-2
              Definitions.
              Throughout, the term “small business” includes all categories of small firms as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) on whose behalf the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) is chartered to advocate, including small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned and service-disabled veteran-owned small business and small business located in HUBZones, as those terms are defined in 13 CFR part 124. The determination of affiliation is a function of the SBA.
              (a) A “Mentor” is a prime contractor that elects to promote and develop small business subcontractors by providing developmental assistance designed to enhance the business success of the Protégé.
              (b) “Program” refers to the USAID Mentor-Protégé Program as described in this Chapter.
              (c) “Protégé” means a small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran owned small business that is the recipient of developmental assistance pursuant to a Mentor-Protégé Agreement.
            
            
              719.273-3
              Incentives for prime contractor participation.
              (a) Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E), USAID is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small business consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to negotiated procurements. (48 CFR) FAR 19.202-1 provides additional guidance.
              (b) Costs incurred by a Mentor to provide developmental assistance, as described in 719.273-8 to fulfill the terms of their agreement(s) with a Protégé firm(s), are not reimbursable as a direct cost under a USAID contract. If USAID is the mentor's responsible audit agency under (48 CFR) FAR 42.703-1, USAID will consider these costs in determining indirect cost rates. If USAID is not the responsible audit agency, mentors are encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with their responsible audit agency on the treatment of such costs when determining indirect cost rates.

              (c) In addition to subparagraph (b) above, contracting officers may give Mentors evaluation credit under (48 CFR) FAR 15.101-1 considerations for subcontracts awarded pursuant to their Mentor-Protégé Agreements and their subcontracting plans. Therefore:
              
              (1) Contracting officers may evaluate subcontracting plans containing Mentor-Protégé arrangements more favorably than subcontracting plans without Mentor-Protégé Agreements.
              (2) Contracting officers may assess the prime contractor's compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in evaluating past performance under (48 CFR) FAR 15.305(a)(2)(v) and determining contractor responsibility (48 CFR) 19.705-5(a)(1).
              (d) OSDBU Mentoring Award. A non-monetary award will be presented annually to the Mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support of a Protégé. The Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).
              (e) OSDBU Mentor-Protégé Annual Conference. At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protégé Program, Mentor firms will be invited to brief contracting officers, program leaders, office directors and other guests on Program progress.

              719.273-4
              Eligibility of Mentor and Protégé firms.
              Eligible business entities approved as Mentors may enter into agreements (hereafter referred to as “Mentor-Protégé Agreement” or “Agreement” and explained in section 719.273-6) with eligible Protégés. Mentors provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of Protégés to perform as contractors and/or subcontractors. Eligible small business entities capable of providing developmental assistance may be approved as Mentors. Protégés may participate in the Program in pursuit of a prime contract or as subcontractors under the Mentor's prime contract with the USAID, but are not required to be a subcontractor to a USAID prime contractor or be a USAID prime contractor. Notwithstanding eligibility requirements in this section, USAID reserves the right to limit the number of participants in the Program in order to insure its effective management of the Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (a) Eligibility. A Mentor:
              (1) May be either a large or small business entity;
              (2) Must be eligible for award of Government contracts;
              (3) Must be able to provide developmental assistance that will enhance the ability of Protégés to perform as prime contractors or subcontractors; and
              (4) Will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with entities with which it has established business relationships.
              (b) Eligibility. A Protégé:
              (1) Must be a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small socially and economically disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business);
              (2) Must meet the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code that the Mentor prime contractor believes best describes the product or service being acquired by the subcontract; and
              (3) Eligible for award of Government contracts.
              (c) Protégés may have multiple Mentors. Protégés participating in Mentor-Protégé programs in addition to USAID's Program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of Mentoring activity so that results of the USAID Program can be reported separately from any other agency program.
              (d) A Protégé firm shall self-certify to a Mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and possess related certifications granted by the Small Business Administration (e.g., HUBZone, 8(a), etc.). Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential Protégés that they meet the specified eligibility requirements. HUBZone and small disadvantaged business status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined according to 13 CFR part 124.
              [49 FR 13243, Apr. 3, 1984, as amended at 79 FR 74988, Dec. 16, 2014]
            
            
              719.273-5
              Selection of Protégé firms.

              (a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting Protégé firms. Mentors are encouraged to select from a broad base of small business including small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and HUBZone firms whose core competencies support USAID's mission.
              (b) Mentors may have multiple Protégés. However, to preserve the integrity of the Program and assure the quality of developmental assistance provided to Protégés, USAID reserves the right to limit the total number of Protégés participating under each Mentor firm for the Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (c) The selection of Protégé firms by Mentor firms may not be protested, except that any protest regarding the size or eligibility status of an entity selected by a Mentor shall be handled in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Small Business Administration regulations.
            
            
              719.273-6
              Application process.
              Entities interested in becoming a Mentor firm must apply in writing to the USAID Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) by submitting form AID 321-1 (OMB Control number 0412-0574 approved on 5/22/2007). The application shall contain the Mentor-Protégé Agreement and shall be evaluated for approval. Evaluations will consider the nature and extent of technical and managerial support as well as any proposed financial assistance in the form of equity investment, loans, joint-venture, and traditional subcontracting support. The Mentor-Protégé Agreement must contain:
              (a) Names, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses (if available) of Mentor and Protégé firm(s) and a point of contact for both Mentor and Protégé;
              (b) A description of the developmental assistance that will be provided by the Mentor to the Protégé, including a description of the work or product contracted for (if any), a schedule for providing assistance, and criteria for evaluation of the Protégé's developmental success;
              (c) A listing of the number and types of subcontracts to be awarded to the Protégé;
              (d) Duration of the Agreement, including rights and responsibilities of both parties (Mentor and Protégé);
              (e) Termination procedures, including procedures for the parties' voluntary withdrawal from the Program. The Agreement shall require the Mentor or the Protégé to notify the other firm in writing at least 30 days in advance of its intent to voluntarily terminate the Agreement;
              (f) Procedures requiring the parties to notify OSDBU immediately upon receipt of termination notice from the other party;
              (g) A plan for accomplishing the work or product contracted for should the Agreement be terminated; and
              (h) Other terms and conditions, as appropriate.
            
            
              719.273-7
              OSDBU review of application.
              (a) OSDBU will review the information to establish the Mentor and Protégé eligibility and to ensure that the information that is in section 719.273-6 is included. If the application relates to a specific contract, then OSDBU will consult with the responsible contracting officer on the adequacy of the proposed Agreement, as appropriate. OSDBU will complete its review no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the application or after consultation with the contracting officer, whichever is later. Application for and enrollment into the Program are free and open to the public.
              (b) After OSDBU completes its review and provides written approval, the Mentor may execute the Agreement and implement the developmental assistance as provided under the Agreement. OSDBU will provide a copy of the Mentor-Protégé Agreement to the USAID contracting officer for any USAID contracts affected by the Agreement.
              (c) The Agreement defines the relationship between the Mentor and Protégé firms only. The Agreement itself does not create any privity of contract or contractual relationship between the Mentor and USAID nor the Protégé and USAID.

              (d) If the application is disapproved, the Mentor may provide additional information for reconsideration. OSDBU will complete review of any supplemental material no later than 30 days after its receipt. Upon finding deficiencies that USAID considers correctable, OSDBU will notify the Mentor and Protégé and request correction of deficiencies to be provided within 15 days.
            
            
              719.273-8

              719.273-9
              Obligations under the Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (a) A Mentor or Protégé may voluntarily withdraw from the Program. However, in no event shall such withdrawal impact the contractual requirements under any prime contract.
              (b) Mentor and Protégé entities shall submit to the USAID Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) annual reports on progress under the Mentor-Protégé Agreement. USAID will evaluate annual reports by considering the following:
              (1) Specific actions taken by the Mentor during the evaluation period to increase the participation of their Protégé(s) as suppliers to the Federal Government and to commercial entities;
              (2) Specific actions taken by the Mentor during the evaluation period to develop technical and administrative expertise of a Protégé as defined in the Agreement;
              (3) The extent to which the Protégé has met the developmental objectives in the Agreement;
              (4) The extent to which the Mentor's participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program impacted the Protégé'(s) ability to receive contract(s) and subcontract(s) from private firms and Federal agencies other than USAID; and, if deemed necessary;
              (5) Input from the Protégé on the nature of the developmental assistance provided by the Mentor.
              (c) OSDBU will submit annual reports to the relevant contracting officer regarding participating prime contractor(s)' performance in the Program.
              (d) Mentor and Protégé firms shall submit an evaluation to OSDBU at the conclusion of the mutually agreed upon Program period, the conclusion of the contract, or the voluntary withdrawal by either party from the Program, whichever comes first.
            
            
              719.273-10
              Internal controls.
              (a) OSDBU will oversee the Program and will work in concert with the Mentor-Protégé Program Manager and relevant contracting officers to achieve Program objectives. OSDBU will establish internal controls as checks and balances applicable to the Program. These controls will include:
              (1) Reviewing and evaluating Mentor applications for validity of the provided information;
              (2) Reviewing annual progress reports submitted by Mentors and Protégés on Protégé development to measure Protégé progress against the plan submitted in the approved Agreement;
              (3) Reviewing and evaluating financial reports and invoices submitted by the Mentor to verify that USAID is not charged by the Mentor for providing developmental assistance to the Protégé; and
              (4) Limiting the number of participants in the Mentor-Protégé Program within a reporting period, in order to insure the effective management of the Program.

              (b) USAID may rescind approval of an existing Mentor-Protégé Agreement if it determines that such action is in USAID's best interest. The rescission shall be in writing and sent to the Mentor and Protégé after approval by the Director of OSDBU. Rescission of an Agreement does not change the terms of any subcontract between the Mentor and the Protégé.

              722.170
              Employment of third country nationals (TCN's) and cooperating country nationals (CCN's).
              (a) General. It is USAID policy that cooperating country nationals (CCNs) and third country nationals (TCNs), who are hired abroad for work in a cooperating country under USAID-direct contracts, generally be extended the same benefits, and be subject to the same restrictions as TCNs and CCNs employed by the USAID Mission. Exceptions to this policy may be granted either by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project. (TCN's and CCN's who are hired to work in the United States shall be extended benefits and subject to restrictions on the same basis as U.S. citizens who work in the United States.)
              (b) Compensation. Compensation, including merit or promotion increases paid to TCN's and CCN's may not, without the approval of the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project, exceed the prevailing compensation paid to personnel performing comparable work in the cooperating country as determined by the USAID Mission. Unless otherwise authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project, the compensation of such TCN and CCN employees shall be paid in the currency of the cooperating country.
              (c) Allowances and differentials. TCN's and CCN's, hired abroad for work in a cooperating country, are not eligible for allowances or differentials under USAID-direct contracts, unless authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project.
              (d) Country and security clearances. The contractor shall insure that the necessary clearances, including security clearances, if required, have been obtained for TCN and CCN employees in accordance with any such requirements set forth in the contract or required by the USAID Mission, prior to the TCN or CCN starting work under the contract.
              (e) Physical fitness. Contractors are required to insure that prospective TCN and CCN employees are examined prior to employment to determine whether the prospective employee meets the minimum physical requirements of the position and is free from any contagious disease.
              (f) Workweek, holidays, and leave. The workweek, holidays, and leave for TCN and CCN employees shall be the same as for all other employees of the contractor, under the terms of the contract; however, TCN and CCN employees are not eligible for home leave or military leave unless authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project.
              (g) Travel and transportation for TCN's and CCN's. Travel and transportation shall be provided TCN and CCN employees on the same basis as for all other employees of the contractor, under the terms of the contract.
              (h) Household effects and motor vehicles. USAID will not provide household effects to TCN and CCN employees; such employees may ship their household effects and motor vehicles to their place of employment on the same basis as for all other employees of the contractor, under the terms of the contract unless they are residents of the cooperating country.

              722.805-70
              Procedures.
              (a) The procedures in this section apply, as appropriate, for all contracts excluding construction, which shall be handled in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR 22.804-1. Contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that the requirements of (48 CFR) FAR 22.8 and related clauses are met before awarding any contracts or consenting to subcontracts subject to these requirements.
              (b) Representations and certifications. The first step in ensuring compliance with these requirements is to obtain all necessary representations and certifications (Reps and Certs) as required by (48 CFR) FAR 22.810 and FAR 4.1202. When applicable, the contracting officer must review the Reps and Certs to determine whether they have been completed and signed as required, and are acceptable.
              
              (c) OFCCP's National Preaward Registry. If the Reps and Certs are complete, signed, and deemed acceptable, and the contracting officer has no reason to doubt their accuracy, the contracting officer must then consult the OFCCP's National Preaward Registry at the internet website in 48 CFR 22.805(a)(4) (i) to see if the offeror is listed.
              (1) If the conditions stated in (48 CFR) FAR 22.805(a) (4) are met (including the contract file documentation requirement in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)), then the contracting officer does not need to take any further action in verifying the offeror's compliance with the requirements of this subpart and (48 CFR) FAR 22.8.
              (2) If the offeror does not appear in the National Preaward Registry, and the estimated amount of the contract or subcontract is expected to be under $10 million then the contracting officer may rely on the Reps and Certs as sufficient verification of the offeror's compliance.
              (3) If the offeror does not appear in the National Preaward Registry and the estimated amount of the contract or subcontract is $10 million or more, then the contracting officer must request a preaward clearance from the appropriate OFCCP regional office, in accordance with 48 CFR 22.805(a). If the initial contact with OFCCP is by telephone, the contracting officer and OFCCP are to mutually determine what information is to be included in the written verification request. The contracting officer may need to provide the following information in addition to the items listed in (48 CFR) FAR 22.805(a)(5), if so requested by the OFCCP regional office:
              (i) Name, title, address, and telephone number of a contract person for the prospective contractor;
              (ii) A description of the type of organization (university, nonprofit, etc.) and its ownership (private, foreign, state, etc.).
              (iii) Names and addresses of the organizations in a joint venture (if any).
              (iv) Type of procurement (new contract—RFP or IFB, amendment, etc.) and the period of the contract.
              (v) Copy of approved Reps and Certs.
              (d) In the event that OFCCP reports that the offeror is not in compliance, negotiations with the offeror shall be terminated.
              (e) Documentation for the contract file. Every contract file must contain completed and signed Reps and Certs. The file must clearly show that these documents have been reviewed and accepted by the contracting officer. If the Reps and Certs were revised to make them acceptable (see paragraph (b) of this section), the file must also document what changes were required and why, and verify that the changes were made. The contracting officer shall also document the OFCCP National Preaward Registry review (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section), and, if the Registry does not include the offeror:
              (1) For contracts or modifications over $10,000 but less than $10 million, the file must contain a statement from the contracting officer that the contractor is considered in compliance with EEO requirements, and giving the basis for this statement (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section). This statement may be in a separate memorandum to the file or in the memorandum of negotiation.
              (2) For contracts or modifications of $10 million or more, the file must document all communications with OFCCP regarding the offeror's compliance. Such documentation includes copies of any written correspondence and a record of telephone conversations, specifying the name, address, and telephone number of the person contacted, a summary of the information presented, and any advice given by OFCCP.
              (f) Documentation in the event of non-compliance. In the event OFCCP determines that a prospective contractor is not in compliance, a copy of OFCCP's written determination, and a summary of resultant action taken (termination of negotiations, notification of offeror and contracting officer's representative, negotiation with next offeror in competitive range, resolicitation, etc.) will be placed in the contract file for any contract which may result, together with other records related to unsuccessful offers, and retained for at least six months following award.

              Exceptions for Foreign Assistance Act functions.
              In addition to the exception stated in (48 CFR) FAR 25.102 for purchases for use outside the United States, there is an exception for economic assistance functions performed under authority of the Foreign Assistance Act. This exception is stated in Executive Order 11223, dated May 12, 1965 (30 FR 6635). U.S. procurement restrictions are applied by USAID, however, as shown elsewhere in this part. These restrictions are generally tighter than the Buy American Act. As a general rule, the tighter USAID restrictions will be used. In the case of certain procurements for use within the United States, the Buy American provision may be used instead in the interest of uniformity among Federal Agencies procuring for domestic use.

              (48 CFR) FAR 25.4 establishes procedures for purchases under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (including GATT's Agreement on Government Procurement) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Under both such agreements, USAID's contracts for the purpose of providing foreign assistance are not subject to the procedures set forth in (48 CFR) FAR 25.4. In contrast, USAID's operating expense-type administrative purchases (i.e., purchases for the direct benefit and use of USAID) are subject to the procedures in (48 CFR) FAR 25.4, unless otherwise exempted by one of the exemptions specified in (48 CFR) FAR 25.4.

In addition, the contracting officer must place a copy of the approved geographic code waiver in the official contract file.

              Advance payment bonds.

              (a) Generally, advance payment bonds will not be required in connection with USAID contracts containing an advance payment provision. In lieu thereof, contracting officers will follow procedures set forth in (48 CFR) FAR 32.409-3.
              
              (b) Whenever a contracting officer considers that an advance payment bond is necessary, the contracting officer will:
              (1) Establish a bond penalty that will adequately protect interests of the Government;
              (2) Use the USAID Advance Payment Bond format;
              (3) Place bond with a surety currently approved by the U.S. Treasury Department according to the latest Treasury Department Circular 570; and
              (4) Stipulate that the cost of the bond shall not exceed a rate of $7.50 per $1,000 per annum based on the penalty of the bond, without the prior written approval of the Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Policy Division (M/OAA/P).
              (c) Where the surety's obligation under an advance payment bond covers all advances made to the contractor during the term of the contract, no release should be issued to the surety until all advances made and to be made under the contract have been fully liquidated in accordance with the provisions of the contract, such as no-pay vouchers, reports of expenditures, or by refund. Where the surety's obligation under the bond is limited to advances made during a specified period of time, no release should be issued to the surety until all advances made and to be made during the specified period have been liquidated as aforesaid.

              728.305-70
              Overseas worker's compensation and war-hazard insurance—waivers and USAID insurance coverage.
              (a) Upon the recommendation of the USAID Administrator, the Secretary of Labor may waive the applicability of the Defense Base Act (DBA) with respect to any contract, subcontract, or subordinate contract, work location, or classification of employees. Either the contractor or USAID can request a waiver from coverage. Such a waiver can apply to any employees who are not U.S. citizens, not residents of, or not hired in the United States. Waivers requested by the contractor are submitted to the contracting officer for approval and further submission to the Department of Labor, which grants the waiver. Application for a waiver is submitted on Labor Department Form BEC 565. USAID has a number of blanket waivers already in effect for certain countries that are applicable to its direct contracts with contractors performing in such countries. Where such waivers are granted from coverage under the DBA, the waiver is conditioned on providing other worker's compensation coverage to employees to which the waiver applies. Usually this takes the form of securing worker's compensation coverage of the country where work will be performed or of the country of the employee's nationality, whichever offers greater benefits. The Department of Labor has granted partial blanket waivers of DBA coverage applicable to USAID-financed contracts performed in certain countries, subject to two conditions:
              (1) Employees hired in the United States by the contractor, and citizens or residents of the United States are to be provided DBA insurance coverage;
              (2) Waived employees (i.e., employees who are neither U.S. citizens nor U.S. resident aliens, and who were hired outside the United States) will be provided worker's compensation benefits as required by the laws of the country in which they are working or the laws of their native country, whichever offers greater benefits. Information as to whether a DBA Waiver has been obtained by USAID for a particular country may be obtained from the cognizant USAID contracting officer.

              (b) To assist contractors in securing insurance at minimal rates for the workmen's compensation insurance required under the DBA, and to facilitate meeting insurance requirements for such coverage, USAID, after open and competitive negotiation, has entered into a contract with an insurance carrier to provide such coverage at a specified rate. The terms of this contract require the insurance carrier to provide coverage, and the contractor to make payments to and handle its claims with that insurance carrier. Contracting officers are responsible for explaining and advising contractors of the details of securing such insurance.

              (c) Automobile liability. In order to ensure that private automobiles used by contractor employees stationed overseas under an USAID contract are properly insured, USAID has established minimum required coverages as a supplement to the (48 CFR) FAR clause at 52.228-7. This supplemental coverage is specified in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-7, and is to be used in all USAID-direct contracts involving performance overseas.

              728.309
              Contract clause for worker's compensation insurance.
              (a) Because of the volume of projects performed overseas resulting in contracts which require worker's compensation insurance, USAID has contracted with an insurance carrier to provide the required insurance for all USAID contractors. It is therefore necessary to supplement the (48 CFR) FAR clause at 52.228-3 with the additional coverage specified in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-3. The coverage specified in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-3 shall be used in addition to the coverage specified in (48 CFR) FAR 52.228-3 in all USAID-direct contracts involving performance overseas.

              (a) USAID is required by law to include language in all its direct contracts and subcontracts ensuring that all U.S. marine insurance companies have a fair opportunity to bid for marine insurance when such insurance is necessary or appropriate under the contract. USAID has therefore established a supplementary preface to the clause at (48 CFR) FAR 52.228-9. This supplementary preface is set forth in (48 CFR) AIDAR 752.228-9, and is required for use in any USAID-direct contract where marine insurance is necessary or appropriate.

              (a) Section 579 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of FY 2003 requires certain steps to prevent countries from imposing taxes [defined as Value Added Tax (VAT) or customs duties] on U.S. foreign assistance, or if imposed, requires the countries to reimburse the assessed taxes or duties. The Act also requires certain reporting to Congress. The Department of State has published guidance for implementing this section of the Act. See http://2001-2009.state.gov/s/d/rm/c10443.htm for further information.
              (b) Contracting Officers (COs) must insert the clause at 752.229-71, Reporting of Foreign Taxes in section I of solicitations and resulting contracts that obligate or subobligate FY 2003 or later funds except for the following:

              (b) Salaries and wages. It is USAID policy that if an employee's base salary plus overseas recruitment incentive, if any (see (48 CFR) AIDAR 731.205-70) exceeds the USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST), as stated in USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 302 USAID Direct Contracting (available at http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/300/302.pdf), it will be allowable only if approved in writing by the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall only provide such approval after internal Agency procedures for review/approval of salaries in excess of the USAID CST in ADS 302 have been followed.

ORI is to be paid as a single payment at the end of the employee tour of duty overseas. The contractor shall take all reasonable and prudent steps to ensure that ORI is not paid to any employee who has received the IRS section 911 exemption.
              (b) In the event that an employee subsequently receives a section 911 exclusion for any part of the base salary upon which this supplement has been paid, such supplement or appropriate portion thereof shall be reimbursed by the contractor to USAID with interest. The interest shall be calculated at the average U.S. Treasury rate in effect for the period that the contractor or his employee had the funds. Neither the contractor's nor the subcontractor's inability to collect refunds from eligible employees shall be used as a basis to excuse subsequent refunds by the contractor to USAID.

Per diem, invitational travel, honoraria and payment for work carried out outside of normal working hours are not considered to be salary supplements subject to the provisions in USAID policy referenced in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Salary supplements are eligible for USAID financing only when authorized in accordance with USAID policy established in the cable State 119780 dated April 15, 1988 in ADS Chapter 302. If salary supplements have been authorized in a particular case, the contracting officer shall provide written approval to the contractor in order for such costs to be eligible. Any specific requirements or limitations shall be specified in the approval.
              (d) Contracting officers shall insert the Clause at 752.231-71 in all contracts in which there is a possibility of the need of HG employees. It should also be inserted in all subsequent subcontracts.

              (ii) For faculty members working under academic year appointments, salary for service under the contract may include the employee's on-campus academic year salary plus “consulting income” as defined above earned during the year proceeding employment under the contract, or salary for service under the contract may be derived by annualizing the academic year salary (in which case “consulting income” may not be included).
              (3) USAID policies and compensation of third country national or cooperating country national employees are set forth in (48 CFR) AIDAR 722.170.

              OMB Circular A-122, cost principles for nonprofit organizations; USAID implementation.
              (a) Paragraph 6 of the transmittal letter for OMB Circular A-122 specifies that “Agencies shall designate a liaison official to serve as the agency representative on matters relating to the implementation of this Circular.” The Director, Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, has been so designated. The Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Cost Audit Support Division, Overhead and Special Cost and Contract Close-Out Branch (M/OAA/CAS/OCC) provides staff assistance to the Director concerning OMB Circular A-122. M/OAA/CAS/OCC is also responsible for obtaining cognizance under the criteria in the transmittal letter for OMB Circular A-122; for liaison with other cognizant agencies; for authorizing exclusion of OMB Circular A-122 coverage for a particular nonprofit organization pursuant to paragraph 5 of the OMB Circular A-122 transmittal letter; and for advice and assistance in applying OMB Circular A-122 cost principles.

              (b) Paragraph 4b of the OMB Circular A-122 transmittal letter contains a definition of prior approval as follows:
              
              
                Prior approval means securing the awarding agency's permission in advance to incur costs for those items that are designated as requiring prior approval by OMB Circular A-122. Generally, this permission will be in writing. Where an item of cost requiring prior approval is specified in the budget of an award, approval of the budget constitute approval of that cost.
              
              
              Consequently, an award containing a budget constitutes prior approval of the direct cost item in the budget, unless otherwise annotated. Accordingly, award budgets should be appropriately annotated substantially as follows:
              
              
                Inclusion of any cost in the line item budget of this award does not obviate the requirement for prior approval of cost items designated as requiring prior approval by OMB Circular A-122 ; or
                In accordance with the requirements to OMB Circular No. A-122, approval is granted to incur costs for (name specific item or items) which are included in the budget of this award.

              Bid and proposal costs.
              Pending the establishment of Government-wide principles in Attachment B of OMB Circular A-122, USAID will treat bid and proposal costs as follows:
              (a) Bid and proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids, proposals, and applications for potential activities such as Government and non-Government grants, contracts and other agreements, including the development of scientific, cost, and other data needed to support such bids, proposals, and applications. Except as provided in (b) below, bid and proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful and unsuccessful bids and proposals normally should be treated as indirect costs for allocation to all current activities, and no bid and proposal costs of past accounting periods will be allocable to the current period. However, if the organization's established practice is to treat bid and proposal costs by some other method, the results obtained may be accepted only if found to be reasonable and equitable.
              (b) Bid and proposal costs incurred by the organization to obtain unrestricted funds are to be treated as fund raising and allocated an appropriate share of indirect costs under the conditions described in paragraph B.3 of Attachment A to OMB Circular A-122.
            
            
              731.772
              Compensation for personal services.

              (f) Subcontractor protests. Subcontractor protests will not be considered.
              (g) Judicial proceedings. Protests will not be considered when the matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction or when the matter involved has been decided on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction.
              (h) Determinations of responsibility by the contracting officer. A determination by the contracting officer that a bidder or offeror is or is not capable of performing a contract will not be reviewed by the M/OAA Director.

              Evaluation board functions.
              Agency architect-engineer evaluation boards shall perform the following functions:
              (a) Prepare a selection memorandum recommending no less than three firms which are considered most highly qualified to perform the required services for submission to the head of the contracting activity for his/her approval. This selection memorandum shall include the information specified in 736.602-3(c).
              (b) In evaluating architect-engineer firms, the architect-engineer evaluation board shall apply the following criteria, other criteria established by Agency regulations, and any criteria set forth in the public notice on a particular contract:
              (1) Specialized experience of the firm (including each member of joint venture or association) with the type of service required;
              (2) Capacity of the firm to perform the work (including any specialized services) within the time limitations;
              (3) Past record of performance on contracts with USAID or other Government agencies and private industry with respect to such factors as control of costs, quality of work, and ability to meet schedules, to the extent such information is available;

              (4) Ability to assign an adequate number of qualified key personnel from the organization, including a competent supervising representative having considerable experience in responsible positions on work of a similar nature;
              (5) The portions of the work the architect-engineer is able to perform with its own forces when required;
              (6) Ability of the architect-engineer to furnish or to obtain required materials and equipment;
              (7) If the geographical or topographical aspects of the project are deemed vital, familiarity with the locality where the project is situated;
              (8) Financial capacity;
              (9) Responsibility of the architect-engineer under standards provided in (48 CFR) FAR subpart 9.1. No contract may be awarded to a contractor that does not meet these standards;
              (10) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Agency, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of architect-engineer contracts among qualified firms. Each architect-engineer evaluation board shall give favorable consideration, to the fullest extent practicable to the most highly qualified firms that have not had prior experience on Government projects (including small business firms and firms owned by the socially and/or economically deprived).
              (c) The evaluation board shall prepare a selection memorandum for the approval of the head of the contracting activity. The selection memorandum will be signed by the board chairman and cleared by each board member. The selection memorandum shall include the following information:
              (1) A listing by name of all firms reviewed by the board;
              (2) A listing of the evaluation criteria applied;
              (3) An analysis of the selection showing the rationale for the board's recommendation;
              (4) The board's recommendation of the three most highly qualified firms, in order of preference;
              (5) An independent Government cost estimate. The evaluation board shall require the project engineer to develop an independent Government estimate of the cost of the required architect-engineer services. Consideration shall be given to the estimated value of the services to be rendered, the scope, complexity, and the nature of the project and the estimated costs expected to be generated by the work. The independent Government estimate shall be revised as required during negotiations to correct noted deficiencies and reflect changes in or clarification of, the scope of the work to be performed by the architect-engineer. A cost estimate based on the application of percentage factors to cost estimates of the various segments of the work involved, e.g., construction project, may be developed for comparison purposes, but such a cost estimate shall not be used as a substitute for the independent Government estimate.

              General.
              Performance monitoring is a function of contract administration used to determine contractor progress towards achieving the goals and objectives of the contract and to identify any factors that may delay or prevent the accomplishment of those goals and objectives. Performance monitoring requires USAID personnel, particularly the contracting officer's representative, to maintain adequate knowledge of the contractor's activities and progress in order to ensure that USAID's objectives, as stated in the contract's Statement of Work, will be achieved.

              742.1170-2
              Applicability.
              (a) This section applies to USAID non-personal, professional/technical services contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, but may be applied to other USAID contracts, if the contracting officer and requiring office determine that doing so is in the best interests of the Agency. The contracting officer must ensure that this determination is documented in the contract file. This section does not apply to personal services contracts.

              (b) The underlying principles of (48 CFR) FAR subpart 42.11 apply to USAID contracts and are inherent to this section. However, not all of the specific requirements and terminology in (48 CFR) FAR subpart 42.11 are compatible with the types of technical assistance contracts usually awarded by USAID. Therefore, this section 742.1170 applies when the requirements of (48 CFR) FAR subpart 42.11 do not meet USAID requirements or are otherwise not appropriate.
              
              (c) The progress reports discussed in this section are separate from the performance evaluation reports prepared in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR subpart 42.15 and internal Agency procedures, although they may be used by USAID personnel or their authorized representatives when evaluating the contractor's performance. Furthermore, the policies, procedures, and limitations of this section do not apply to technical reports, studies, papers, etc., the acquisition of which may be part of or even the sole purpose of the contract.

              742.1170-3
              Policy.
              (a) The contractor is responsible for timely contract performance. Performance monitoring by USAID does not obviate this responsibility.
              (b) The requiring office, particularly the contracting officer's representative and the contracting officer, will determine how to monitor the contractor's performance to protect the Government's interests, by considering:
              (1) The contract requirements for reporting progress;
              (2) The contract performance schedule;
              (3) The contractor's implementation plan or workplan;
              (4) The contractor's history of contract performance;
              (5) The contractor's experience with the services or supplies being provided under the contract;
              (6) The contractor's financial capability;
              (7) Any other factors the requiring office, particularly the contracting officer's representative and the contracting officer, considers appropriate and necessary to adequately monitor contractor performance (for example, the day-to-day working proximity of the contracting officer's representative or contracting officer to the contractor's place of performance).
              (c) In monitoring contractor performance, the requiring office (particularly the contracting officer's representative and contracting officer) must utilize any of the contractor's existing systems or processes for monitoring progress, provided that doing so is not contrary to the terms of the contract. The requiring officer or contracting officer's representative must not require anything from the contractor that is outside the scope or terms of the contract or may result in claims of waivers, of changes, or of other contract modifications. Further, progress reports shall not require information already available from other sources.

              742.1170-4
              Progress reporting requirements and contract clause.
              (a) When the requiring office needs information on contract performance status on a regular basis, the contracting officer may require the contractor to submit periodic progress reports, tailored to address specific contract requirements but limited to only that information essential to USAID's needs in monitoring the contractor's progress.
              (b) Because the contracting officer's representative is the individual most familiar with the contractor's performance, the contractor must submit the progress reports directly to the cognizant technical officer. The contracting officer's representative must review the reports and advise the contracting officer, in writing, of any recommended action, including any action needed to address potential or actual delays in performance. The contracting officer's representative must so advise the contracting officer in sufficient time, typically thirty days, for him or her to take any action that the contracting officer determines is appropriate. The requirements of this paragraph do not relieve the contractor of notification requirements identified elsewhere in the contract.
              (c) The contracting officer must insert the clause at 752.242-70, Periodic Progress Reports, in solicitations and contracts that require progress reporting, as specified in this section. The contracting officer must include specific reporting instructions in the Schedule.

              The Foreign Aid and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1963, and subsequent appropriation Acts, have imposed the following requirement:
              None of the funds appropriated or made available pursuant to this Act for carrying out the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, may be used for making payments on any contract for procurement to which the United States is a party entered into after the date of enactment of this Act which does not contain a provision authorizing the termination of such contract for the convenience of the United States.

No individual shall serve as a member of a board for the review of a proposed settlement if he/she has theretofore reviewed, approved or disapproved or recommended approval, disapproval or other action with respect to any substantive element of such settlement proposal.
              (c) The chairman shall appoint a nonvoting recorder who shall be responsible for receiving cases, scheduling and recording the proceedings at meetings, maintaining a log of all cases received by him/her for the board, and other duties as assigned by the board.

              (2) The settlement or determination is limited to adjustment of the fee of a cost-reimbursement contract or subcontract and: (i) In the case of complete termination, the fee, as adjusted, with respect to the terminated portion of the contract or subcontract is $100,000 or more; or (ii) in the case of a partial termination, the fee, as adjusted, with respect to the terminated portion of the contract or subcontract is $100,000 or more;
              (3) The head of the contracting activity concerned determines that a review of a specific case or class of cases is desirable; or
              (4) The contracting officer, in his/her discretion, desires review by the board.
              (b) Level of review. Proposed settlements in excess of $5 million shall be reviewed and approved by a board consisting of the M/OAA Director, the General Counsel, and the Controller, without power of redelegation.
              (c) Submission of information. The contracting officer shall submit to the board a statement of the proposed settlement agreement or determination, supported by such detailed information as is required for an adequate review. This information should normally include copies of: (1) The contractor's or subcontractor's settlement proposal, (2) the audit report, (3) the property disposal report and any required approvals in connection therewith, and (4) the contracting officer's memorandum explaining the settlement. The board may, in its discretion, require the submission of additional information.

              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart sets forth the standards and the procedures for disposition of requests for extraordinary contractual actions under Executive Order 11223.
            
            
              750.7101
              Authority.

              Under section 633 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 75 Stat. 454 (22 U.S.C. 2933), as amended; Executive Order 11223, dated May 12, 1965 (30 FR 6635), as amended; and Executive Order 12163, dated September 29, 1979 (44 FR 56673), as amended, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development has been granted authority to provide extraordinary contractual relief. The Authority is set forth in sections 3 and 4 of Executive Order 11223, as follows:
              
              
                
                  Section 3. With respect to cost-type contracts heretofore or hereafter made with non-profit institutions under which no fee is charged or paid, amendments or modifications of such contracts may be made with or without consideration and may be utilized to accomplish the same things as any original contract could have accomplished, irrespective of the time or circumstances of the making, or of the form of the contract amended or modified, or of the amending or modifying contract and irrespective of rights which may have accrued under the contract or the amendments or modifications thereof.
                
                  Section 4. With respect to contracts heretofore or hereafter made, other than those described in section 3 of this order, amendments and modifications of such contracts may be made with or without consideration and may be utilized to accomplish the same things as any original contract could have accomplished, irrespective of the time or circumstances of the making, or the form of the contract amended or modified, or of the amending or modifying contract, and irrespective of rights which may have accrued under the contract or the amendments or modifications thereof, if the Secretary of State or the Director of the United States International Development Cooperation Agency (with respect to functions vested in or delegated to Director) determines in each case that such action is necessary to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States.

              750.7102
              General policy.
              Extra-contractual claims arising from foreign assistance contracts will be processed in accordance with this subpart, which is similar to that utilized to process claims for extraordinary relief under (48 CFR) FAR part 50, as modified to meet the circumstances involved under the Foreign Assistance Act and the different authority involved.

              750.7103
              Definitions.
              (a) The term approving authority as used in this subpart means an officer or official having been delegated authority to approve actions under the Executive Order. This authority is distinguished from authority to take appropriate contractual action pursuant to such approval.
              (b) The term the Executive Order shall mean Executive Order 11223 (30 FR 6635) as amended, unless otherwise stated.
              (c) The term the Act shall mean the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.

              750.7104
              Types of actions.
              Three types of actions may be taken by or pursuant to the direction of an approving authority under the Executive Order. These are contractual adjustments such as amendments without consideration, correction of mistakes, and formalization of informal commitments.
            
            
              750.7105
              Approving authorities.
              All authority to approve actions under this subpart has been delegated to the M/OAA Director.
              [50 FR 16086, Apr. 24, 1985, as amended at 64 FR 42040, Aug. 3, 1999; 72 FR 19670, Apr. 19, 2007]

              Standards for deciding cases.
            
            
              750.7106-1
              General.
              The mere fact that losses occur under a Government contract is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for the exercise of the authority conferred by the Executive Order. Whether, in a particular case, appropriate action such as amendment without consideration, correction of a mistake or ambiguity in a contract, or formalization of an informal commitment, will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States is a matter of sound judgment to be made on the basis of all of the facts of such case. Although it is obviously impossible to predict or enumerate all the types of cases with respect to which action may be appropriate, examples of certain cases or types of cases where action may be proper are set forth in sections 750.7106-2 through 750.7106-4. Even if all of the factors contained in any of the examples are present, other factors or considerations in a particular case may warrant denial of the request. These examples are not intended to exclude other cases where the approving authority determines that the circumstances warrant action.
            
            
              750.7106-2
              Amendments without consideration.
              (a) Where an actual or threatened loss under a foreign assistance contract, however caused, will impair the productive ability of a contractor whose continued performance of any foreign assistance contract or whose continued operation as a source of supply is found to be essential to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States, the contract may be adjusted but only to the extent necessary to avoid such impairment to the contractor's productive ability.

              (b) Where a contractor suffers a loss (not merely a diminution of anticipated profits) on a foreign assistance contract as a result of Government action, the character of the Government action will generally determine whether any adjustment in the contract will be made and its extent. Where the Government action is directed primarily at the contractor and is taken by the Government in its capacity as the other contracting party, the contract may be adjusted if fairness so requires; thus where such Government action, although not creating any liability on its part, increases the cost of performance, considerations of fairness may make appropriate some adjustment in the contract.
            
            
              750.7106-3
              Mistakes.
              A contract may be amended or modified to correct or mitigate the effect of a mistake, including the following examples:
              (a) A mistake or ambiguity which consists of the failure to express or to express clearly in the written contract the agreements as both parties understood them;
              (b) A mistake on the part of the contractor which is so obvious that it was or should have been apparent to the contracting officer; and
              (c) A mutual mistake as to a material fact.
              Amending contracts to correct mistakes with the least possible delay normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States by expediting the procurement program and by giving contractors proper assurance that such mistakes will be corrected expeditiously and fairly.
            
            
              750.7106-4
              Informal commitments.
              Informal commitments may be formalized under certain circumstances to permit payment to persons who have taken action without a formal contract; for example, where any person, pursuant to written or oral instructions from an officer or official of the Agency and relying in good faith upon the apparent authority of the officer or official to issue such instructions, has arranged to furnish or has furnished property or services to the agency and/or to a foreign assistance contractor or subcontractor without formal contractual coverage for such property or services. Formalization of commitments under such circumstances normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States by assuring persons that they will be treated fairly and paid expeditiously.

              (2) The making of any contract in violation of existing law relating to limitation on profit or fees;
              (3) The waiver of any bid, payment performance or other bond required by law.
              (b) No amendments, or modifications shall be entered into under the authority of the Executive Order:
              (1) Unless, with respect to cases falling within Section 4 of the Executive Order, a finding is made that the action is necessary to protect the foreign policy interests of the United States;
              (2) Unless other legal authority in the Agency is deemed to be lacking or inadequate;
              (3) Except within the limits of the amounts appropriated and the statutory contract authorization.
              (c) No contract shall be amended or modified unless the request therefor has been filed before all obligations (including final payment) under the contract have been discharged.
              (d) No informal commitment shall be formalized unless:
              (1) A request for payment has been filed within six months after arranging to furnish or furnishing property or services in reliance upon the commitment;
              (2) USAID has received the services satisfactorily performed, or has accepted property furnished in reliance on the commitment;
              (3) The USAID employees alleged to have made the informal commitment have accepted responsibility for making the informal commitment in question; and
              (4) USAID has taken appropriate action to prevent recurrence.

              (c) Contracting activities may choose to incorporate provisions in full text, when:
              (1) A new clause or significant revisions to an existing clause is issued less than six months prior to issuance of a solicitation or a contract award;
              (2) Listing a clause in full text will ensure compliance with the contract terms and conditions;

              (3) Inclusion of clauses in full text is more practical under the local conditions (e.g., situations where doing so will assist small local entities, the prospective contractors may have limited Internet access, etc.).

              (d) If a solicitation or contract contains one or more FAR provisions or clauses incorporated by reference, the contracting officer must insert the following Internet address: http://www.acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html in FAR clause 52.252-1, Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference or 52.252-2, Clauses Incorporated by Reference.

              (a) The contracting officer must insert the provision at 752.252-1, Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference, in solicitations in order to incorporate AIDAR provisions by reference.
              (b) The contracting officer must insert the clause at 752.252-2, AIDAR Clauses Incorporated by Reference, in solicitations and contracts in order incorporate AIDAR clauses by reference.
              (c) The contracting officer must insert the provision at 752.252-70, Provisions and Clauses to be Completed by the Offeror, in full text in solicitations or contract containing FAR or AIDAR provision(s) or clause(s) that must be completed by offerors or prospective contractors and submitted with the quotation or offer.

              As prescribed in (48 CFR) AIDAR 704.404(a), when the clause in (48 CFR) FAR 52.204-2 is used in USAID contracts, paragraph (a) of the clause is revised as follows:
              
                Security Requirements (FEB 1999)

                Pursuant to the Foreign Affairs Manual, 12 FAM 540 (http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/88404.pdf), USAID applies the safeguards applicable to “Confidential” information to administratively controlled information designated as “Sensitive But Unclassified”.

                (a) This clause applies to the extent that this contract involves access to classified (`Confidential', `Secret', or `Top Secret'), or administratively controlled (`Sensitive But Unclassified') information.

              Partner vetting pre-award requirements.
              As prescribed in (48 CFR) AIDAR 704.7005(a), insert the following provision in all solicitations subject to vetting:
              
                Partner Vetting Pre-award Requirements (FEB 2012)
                (a) USAID has determined that any contract resulting from this solicitation is subject to vetting. Terms used in this provision are defined in paragraph (b) of the (48 CFR) AIDAR clause at 752.204-71 Partner Vetting, of this solicitation. An offeror that has not passed vetting is ineligible for award.
                (b) The following are the vetting procedures for this solicitation:
                (1) Prospective offerors review the attached USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, and submit any questions about the USAID Partner Information Form or these procedures to the contracting officer by the deadline for questions in the solicitation.

                (2) The contracting officer notifies the offeror when to submit the USAID Partner Information Form. For this solicitation, USAID will vet at [insert in the provision the applicable stage of the source selection process at which the contracting officer will notify the offeror(s) who must be vetted]. Within the timeframe set by the contracting officer in the notification, the offeror must complete and submit the information on the USAID Partner Information Form in accordance with instructions from the vetting official named in paragraph (d) of the (48 CFR) AIDAR clause at 752.204-71 Partner Vetting, of this solicitation.
                
                
                  Note:
                  Offerors who submit using non-secure methods of transmission do so at their own risk.
                
                
                (3) The offerors must notify proposed subcontractors of this requirement when the subcontractors are subject to vetting.

                (c) Source selection proceeds separately from vetting. Vetting is conducted independently from any discussions the contracting officer may have with an offeror. The offeror and any subcontractor subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to other than the vetting official. The offeror and any subcontractor subject to vetting will communicate only with the vetting official regarding their vetting submission(s) and not with any other USAID or USG personnel, including the contracting officer or his/her representatives. Exchanges between the Government and an offeror about vetting information submitted by the offeror or any proposed subcontractor are clarifications in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR 15.306(a) (48 CFR 15.306(a)). The contracting officer designates the vetting official as the only individual authorized to clarify the offeror's and proposed subcontractor's vetting information.
                (d)(1) The vetting official notifies the offeror that it:
                (i) Has passed vetting,
                (ii) Has not passed vetting, or
                (iii) Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specified in the notification.
                (2) The vetting official will include in the notification any information that USAID's Office of Security (SEC) determines releasable. In its determination, SEC will take into consideration the classification or sensitivity of the information, the need to protect sources and methods, or status of ongoing law enforcement and intelligence community investigations or operations.
                (e) Reconsideration. (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, an offeror that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.
                (2) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the offeror's additional information warrants a revised decision.
                (3) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.
                (f) Revisions to vetting information. (1) Offerors who change key individuals, whether the offeror has previously passed vetting or not, must submit a revised USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official. This includes changes to key personnel resulting from revisions to the technical proposal.
                (2) The vetting official will follow the vetting process in paragraph (d) of this clause for any revision of the offeror's Form.
                (g) Award. At the time of award, the contracting officer will confirm with the vetting official that the apparently successful offeror has passed vetting. The contracting officer may award only to an apparently successful offeror that has passed vetting.

              Partner vetting.
              As prescribed in (48 CFR) AIDAR 704.7005(b)(1) and 716.506(a), insert the following clause in all contracts subject to vetting:
              
                Partner Vetting (FEB 2012)
                (a) The contractor must comply with the vetting requirements for key individuals under this contract.
                (b) Definitions. As used in this provision—
                
                  Key individual means:
                (i) Principal officers of the organization's governing body (e.g., chairman, vice chairman, treasurer and secretary of the board of directors or board of trustees);

                (ii) The principal officer and deputy principal officer of the organization (e.g., executive director, deputy director, president, vice president);
                (iii) The program manager or chief of party for the USG-financed program; and
                (iv) Any other person with significant responsibilities for administration of the USG-financed activities or resources, such as key personnel as described in Automated Directives System Chapter 302. Key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the prime contractor, must be vetted.
                
                  Vetting official means the USAID employee identified in paragraph (d) of this clause as having responsibility for receiving vetting information, responding to questions about information to be included on the USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, coordinating with the USAID Office of Security, and conveying the vetting determination to each offeror, potential subcontractors subject to vetting, and to the contracting officer. The vetting official is not part of the contracting office and has no involvement in the source selection process.
                (c) The Contractor must submit a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified below during the contract when the Contractor replaces key individuals with individuals who have not been previously vetting for this contract. Note: USAID will not approve any key personnel who have not passed vetting.
                (d) The designated vetting official is:
                Vetting official:
                
                Address:
                
                
                
                
                Email: __________ (for inquiries only)
                
                (e)(1) The vetting official will notify the Contractor that it—
                (i) Has passed vetting,
                (ii) Has not passed vetting, or
                (iii) Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specifies.
                (2) The vetting official will include in the notification any information that USAID's Office of Security (SEC) determines releasable. In its determination, SEC will take into consideration the classification or sensitivity of the information, the need to protect sources and methods, or status of ongoing law enforcement and intelligence community investigations or operations.
                (f) Reconsideration. (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, the contractor or prospective subcontractor that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.
                (2) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the contractor's additional information warrants a revised decision.
                (3) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.
                (g) A notification that the Contractor has passed vetting does not constitute any other approval under this contract.
                (h) When the contractor anticipates awarding a subcontract for which consent is required under (48 CFR) FAR clause 52.244-2, Subcontracts, the subcontract is subject to vetting. The prospective subcontractor must submit a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified in paragraph (d) of this clause. The contracting officer must not consent to award of a subcontract to any organization that has not passed vetting when required.
                (i) The contractor agrees to incorporate the substance of paragraphs (a) through (g) of this clause in all subcontracts under this contract.
              
              (End of clause)

              Alternate I (FEB 2012). As prescribed in 704.7005(b)(2), substitute paragraphs (h) and (i) below for paragraphs (h) and (i) of the basic clause:
              
              
                (h)(1) When the contractor anticipates awarding a subcontract for which consent is required under (48 CFR) FAR clause 52.244-2, Subcontracts, the subcontract is subject to vetting. The prospective subcontractor must submit a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified in paragraph (d) of this clause. The contracting officer must not consent to award of a subcontract to any organization that has not passed vetting when required.

                Access to USAID Facilities and USAID's Information Systems (AUG 2013)
                (a) A U.S. citizen or resident alien engaged in the performance of this award as an employee, consultant, or volunteer of a U.S firm may obtain access to USAID facilities or logical access to USAID's information systems only when and to the extent necessary to carry out this award and in accordance with this clause. The contractor's employees, consultants, or volunteers who are not U.S. citizen as well as employees, consultants, or volunteers of non-U.S. firms, irrespective of their citizenship, will not be granted logical access to U.S. Government information technology systems (such as Phoenix, GLAAS, etc.) and must be escorted to use U.S. Government facilities (such as office space).

                (b) Before a contractor (or a contractor employee, consultant, or volunteer) or subcontractor at any tier may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing the individual routine access to USAID facilities in the United States, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form to the Enrollment Office personnel when undergoing processing. One identity source document must be a valid Federal or State Government-issued picture ID. Contractors may contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation. Submission of these documents, to include documentation of security background investigations, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a PIV/FAC card and be granted access to any of USAID's information systems. All such individuals must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their enrollment.
                (c) The contractor or its Facilities Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to the contracting officer's representative (COR) upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.
                (d) Individuals engaged in the performance of this award as employees, consultants, or volunteers of the contractor must comply with all applicable Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) procedures, as described above, and any subsequent USAID or Government-wide HSPD-12 and PIV procedures/policies.
                (e) The contractor is required to insert this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor, subcontractor employee, or consultant to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

                (b) The contracting officer shall provide the contractor with written instructions concerning the conflict. USAID reserves the right to terminate the contract if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.

                (b) Wherever measurements are required or authorized, they shall be made, computed, and recorded in metric system units of measurement, unless otherwise authorized by USAID in writing when it has found that such usage is impractical or is likely to cause U.S. firms to experience significant inefficiencies or the loss of markets. Where the metric system is not the predominant standard for a particular application, measurements may be expressed in both the metric and the traditional equivalent units, provided the metric units are listed first.

                (b) Payment of the base fee and award fee shall be made as specified in the Schedule; provided, that after payment of 85 percent of the base fee and potential award fee, the contracting officer may withhold further payment of the base fee and award fee until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the contracting officer considers necessary to protect the Government's interest. This reserve shall not exceed 15 percent of the total base fee and potential award fee or $100,000, whichever is less. The contracting officer shall release 75 percent of all fee withholds under this contract after receipt of the certified final indirect cost rate proposal covering the year of physical completion of this contract, provided the Contractor has satisfied all other contract terms and conditions, including the submission of the final patent and royalty reports, and is not delinquent in submitting final vouchers on prior years' settlements. The contracting officer may release up to 90 percent of the fee withholds under this contract based on the Contractor's past performance related to the submission and settlement of final indirect cost rate proposals.

              Partner vetting in indefinite delivery contracts.
              As prescribed in (48 CFR) AIDAR 716.506(b)(1), insert the following clause in all indefinite-delivery contracts subject to vetting:
              
                Partner Vetting in Indefinite Delivery Contracts (FEB 2012)
                (a) The contractor must comply with the vetting requirements for key individuals under this contract and in any orders that are identified as subject to vetting.
                (b) Definitions. As used in this provision—
                
                  Key individual means:
                (i) Principal officers of the organization's governing body (e.g., chairman, vice chairman, treasurer and secretary of the board of directors or board of trustees);
                (ii) The principal officer and deputy principal officer of the organization (e.g., executive director, deputy director, president, vice president);
                (iii) The program manager or chief of party for the USG-financed program; and
                (iv) Any other person with significant responsibilities for administration of the USG-financed activities or resources, such as key personnel as described in Automated Directives System Chapter 302. Key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the prime contractor, must be vetted.
                
                  Vetting official means the USAID employee identified in paragraph (d) of this clause as having responsibility for receiving vetting information, responding to questions about information to be included on the USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, coordinating with the USAID Office of Security, and conveying the vetting determination to each contractor, potential subcontractors subject to vetting, and to the cognizant contracting officer. The vetting official is not part of the contracting office and has no involvement in the source selection process.
                (c) The contractor must submit a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13 to the designated vetting official:
                (1) when the contractor replaces key individuals under the basic contract with individuals who have not been previously vetted.
                (2) when the contractor replaces key individuals under an order subject to vetting with individuals who have not been previously vetted. For changes to any key individuals associated with both the basic contract and any orders subject to vetting, the contractor must submit updated vetting forms to each designated vetting official. Note: USAID will not approve any key personnel who have not passed vetting.
                (d)(1) The designated vetting official for the basic contract is:
                Vetting official:
                
                Address:
                
                
                
                
                Email: __________ (for inquiries only)
                (2) Each order subject to vetting will identify the vetting official for that order. The contractor must submit vetting information specific to an order to the vetting official identified in that order.
                (e)(1) The vetting official will notify the contractor that it—
                (i) Has passed vetting,
                (ii) Has not passed vetting, or
                (iii) Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specifies.
                (2) The vetting official will include in the notification any information that USAID's Office of Security (SEC) determines releasable. In its determination, SEC will take into consideration the classification or sensitivity of the information, the need to protect sources and methods, or status of ongoing law enforcement and intelligence community investigations or operations.
                (f) Reconsideration. (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, the contractor or prospective subcontractor that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.

                (2) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the contractor's additional information warrants a revised decision.
                
                (3) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.
                (g) A notification that the contractor has passed vetting does not constitute any other approval under this contract.
                (h) The request for task or delivery order proposals will identify whether the order is subject to vetting. The following are the procedures for vetting orders under this contract. Note that the term “awardee” as used below refers to a contractor under multiple-award indefinite-delivery contracts, consistent with the use of the term in (48 CFR) FAR 16.505(b):
                (1) The contracting officer will notify the awardees when to complete and submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official named in the request for order proposals. Note: Awardees who submit using non-secure methods of transmission do so at their own risk.
                (2) The awardee must notify proposed subcontractors of this requirement when the subcontractors are subject to vetting.
                (3) The fair opportunity process proceeds separately from vetting. Vetting is conducted independently from any discussions the contracting officer may have with an awardee. The awardee and any subcontractor subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to other than the vetting official identified in the request for order proposal. The awardee and any subcontractor subject to vetting will communicate only with the vetting official regarding their vetting submission(s) and not with any other USAID or USG personnel, including the contracting officer or his/her representatives.
                (4)(i) The vetting official notifies the awardee that it:
                (A) Has passed vetting,
                (B) Has not passed vetting, or
                (C) Must provide additional information, and resubmit the USAID Partner Information Form with the additional information within the number of days the vetting official specified in the notification.
                (ii) The vetting official will include in the notification any information that USAID's Office of Security (SEC) determines releasable. In its determination, SEC will take into consideration the classification or sensitivity of the information, the need to protect sources and methods, or status of ongoing law enforcement and intelligence community investigations or operations.
                (5) Reconsideration. (i) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, an awardee that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.
                (ii) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the contractor's additional information warrants a revised decision.
                (iii) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.
                (6) Revisions to vetting information. (i) Before the order is awarded, any awardee who changes key individuals, whether it has previously passed vetting or not, must submit a revised USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official. This includes changes to key personnel resulting from revisions to the technical proposal.
                (ii) The order vetting official will follow the vetting process in paragraph (e) of this clause for any revision of the awardee's Form.
                (7) Award of order. The contracting officer may award an order subject to vetting only to an apparently successful awardee that has passed vetting for that order.
                (i) When the contractor anticipates awarding a subcontract for which consent is required under (48 CFR) FAR clause 52.244-2, Subcontracts, the subcontract is subject to vetting. The prospective subcontractor must submit a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the designated vetting official. The contracting officer must not consent to award of a subcontract to any organization that has not passed vetting when required.
                (j) The contractor agrees to incorporate the substance of paragraphs (a) through (g) of this clause in all subcontracts under this contract.
              
              (End of clause)

              Alternate I (FEB 2012). As prescribed in 716.506(b), substitute paragraphs (i) and (j) below for paragraphs (i) and (j) of the basic clause:
              
              
                (i)(1) When the contractor anticipates awarding a subcontract for which consent is required under (48 CFR) FAR clause 52.244-2, Subcontracts, the subcontract is subject to vetting. The prospective subcontractor must submit a USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the designated vetting official. The contracting officer must not consent to award of a subcontract to any organization that has not passed vetting when required.
                (2) In addition, prospective subcontractors at any tier providing the following classes of items (supplies and services):
                
                
                
                

                must pass vetting. Contractors must not place subcontracts for these classes of items until they receive confirmation from the vetting official that the prospective subcontractor has passed vetting.
                
                (j) The contractor agrees to incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts under this contract.

                USAID Disability Policy (DEC 2004)
                (a) The objectives of the USAID Disability Policy are:

                (1) To enhance the attainment of United States foreign assistance program goals by promoting the participation and equalization of opportunities of individuals with disabilities in USAID policy, country and sector strategies, activity designs and implementation;
                
                (2) To increase awareness of issues of people with disabilities both within USAID programs and in host countries;
                (3) To engage other U.S. Government agencies, host country counterparts, governments, implementing organizations and other donors in fostering a climate of nondiscrimination against people with disabilities; and

                (4) To support international advocacy for people with disabilities. The full text of USAID's policy can be found at the following Web site:http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ631.pdf.
                (b) USAID therefore requires that the contractor not discriminate against people with disabilities in the implementation of USAID programs and that it make every effort to comply with the objectives of the USAID Disability Policy in performing this contract. To that end and within the scope of the contract, the contractor's actions must demonstrate a comprehensive and consistent approach for including men, women, and children with disabilities.

                Nondiscrimination (June 2012)
                FAR part 22 and the clauses prescribed in that part prohibit contractors performing in or recruiting from the U.S. from engaging in certain discriminatory practices.
                USAID is committed to achieving and maintaining a diverse and representative workforce and a workplace free of discrimination. Based on law, Executive Order, and Agency policy, USAID prohibits discrimination in its own workplace on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, disability, age, veteran's status, sexual orientation, genetic information, marital status, parental status, political affiliation, and any other conduct that does not adversely affect the performance of the employee. USAID does not tolerate any type of discrimination (in any form, including harassment) of any employee or applicant for employment on any of the above-described bases.
                Contractors are required to comply with the nondiscrimination requirements of the FAR. In addition, the Agency strongly encourages all its contractors (at all tiers) to develop and enforce nondiscrimination policies consistent with USAID's approach to workplace nondiscrimination as described in this clause, subject to applicable law.

                Patent Reporting Procedures (AUG 1999)
                (a) Reporting inventions. In accordance with 37 CFR part 401, each USAID-funded research recipient must disclose each subject invention to USAID as required in (48 CFR) FAR 52.227-11(c). Such reports must be made via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) EDISON Patent Reporting and Tracking system. NIH created EDISON to help assist research recipients to comply with the Bayh-Dole Act and report in a timely manner all patentable inventions arising out of Federally-sponsored research programs. The EDISON system uses Web technology to allow research recipients to report and monitor their invention reports, with the assurance that proprietary data is securely stored. The Web site for EDISON (http://www.iedison.gov) provides users with an invention reporting test site, as well as applicable instructions for complying with Government regulations, and increases the potential for successful commercialization of the inventions by helping to ensure that all reporting requirements are met and that ownership rights are clearly established.
                (b) Reports on utilization of subject inventions as required under (48 CFR) FAR 52.227-11(f) must be provided to the USAID contracting officer's technical representative annually, and the last report under an agreement must be provided within 90 days of the expiration of the agreement.

                (a) The Contractor agrees to procure Defense Base Act (DBA) insurance pursuant to the terms of the contract between USAID and USAID's DBA insurance carrier unless the Contractor has a DBA self insurance program approved by the Department of Labor or has an approved retrospective rating agreement for DBA.
                
                (b) If USAID or the contractor has secured a waiver of DBA coverage (see (48 CFR) AIDAR 728.305-70(a)) for contractor's employees who are not citizens of, residents of, or hired in the United States, the contractor agrees to provide such employees with worker's compensation benefits as required by the laws of the country in which the employees are working, or by the laws of the employee's native country, whichever offers greater benefits.
                (c) The Contractor further agrees to insert in all subcontracts hereunder to which the DBA is applicable, a clause similar to this clause, including this sentence, imposing on all subcontractors a like requirement to provide overseas workmen's compensation insurance coverage and obtain DBA coverage under the USAID requirements contract.

              Standards for accessibility for the disabled in USAID construction contracts.
              As prescribed in 736.570, for contracts for construction or renovation using program funds, insert the following clause.
              
                Standards for Accessibility for the Disabled in USAID Construction Contracts (July 2007)

                (a) One of the objectives of the USAID Disability Policy is to engage other U.S. Government agencies, host country counterparts, governments, implementing organizations and other donors in fostering a climate of nondiscrimination against people with disabilities. As part of this policy USAID has established standards for any new or renovation construction project funded by USAID to allow access by people with disabilities (PWDs). The full text of the policy paper can be found at the following Web site: http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/disability/.
                
                (b) USAID requires the contractor to comply with standards of accessibility for people with disabilities in all structures, buildings or facilities resulting from new or renovation construction or alterations of an existing structure.
                (c) The contractor must comply with the host country or regional standards for accessibility in construction when such standards result in at least substantially equivalent accessibility and usability as the standard provided in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Guidelines of July 2004. Where there are no host country or regional standards for universal access or where the host country or regional standards fail to meet the ADA/ABA threshold, the standard prescribed in the ADA and the ABA must be used.
                (d) New Construction. All new construction must comply with the above standards for accessibility.
                (e) Alterations. Changes to an existing structure that affect, or could affect, the usability of the structure must comply with the above standards for accessibility unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's advance approval that compliance is technically infeasible or constitutes an undue burden or both. Compliance is technically infeasible where structural conditions would require removing or altering a load-bearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements of the standard. Compliance is an undue burden where it entails either a significant difficulty or expense or both.
                (f) Exceptions. The following construction related activities are excepted from the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section:
                (1) Normal maintenance, re-roofing, painting or wallpapering, or changes to mechanical or electrical systems are not alterations and the above standards do not apply unless they affect the accessibility of the building or facility; and
                (2) emergency construction (which may entail the provision of plastic sheeting or tents, minor repair and upgrading of existing structures, rebuilding of part of existing structures, or provision of temporary structures) intended to be temporary in nature. A portion of emergency construction assistance may be provided to people with disabilities as part of the process of identifying disaster- and crisis-affected people as “most vulnerable.”

              As prescribed in (48 CFR) AIDAR 742.1170-4(c), insert the following clause in contracts for which periodic progress reports are required from the contractor. The term “contract” shall be interpreted as “task order” or “delivery order” when this clause is used in an indefinite-delivery contract.
              
                Periodic Progress Reports (OCT 2007)

                (a) The contractor shall prepare and submit progress reports as specified in the contract schedule. These reports are separate from the interim and final performance evaluation reports prepared by USAID in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR 42.15 and internal Agency procedures, but they may be used by USAID personnel or their authorized representatives when evaluating the contractor's performance.
                (b) During any delay in furnishing a progress report required under this contract, the contracting officer may withhold from payment an amount not to exceed US$25,000 (or local currency equivalent) or 5 percent of the amount of this contract, whichever is less, until such time as the contractor submits the report or the contracting officer determines that the delay no longer has a detrimental effect on the Government's ability to monitor the contractor's progress.

                Government Property—USAID Reporting Requirements (OCT 2017)

                (a)(1) The term Government-furnished property, wherever it appears in the following clause, shall mean (i) non-expendable personal property owned by or leased to the U.S. Government and furnished to the contractor, and (ii) personal property furnished either prior to or during the performance of this contract by any U.S. Government accountable officer to the contractor for use in connection with performance of this contract and identified by such officer as accountable. All mobile Information Technology (IT) equipment, including but not limited to, mobile phones (e.g. smartphones), laptops, tablets, and encrypted devices provided as government furnished property, title to which vests in the U.S. Government, are considered accountable personal property.
                (2) The term Government property, wherever it appears in the following clause, shall mean Government-furnished property, Contractor acquired mobile IT equipment and non-expendable personal property title to which vests in the U.S. Government under this contract.
                (3) Non-expendable personal property, for purposes of this contract, is defined as personal property that is complete in itself, does not lose its identity or become a component part of another article when put into use; is durable, with an expected service life of two years or more; and that has a unit cost of more than $500.

                Title to and Care of Property (APR 1984)
                (a) Title to all non-expendable property purchased with contract funds under this contract and used in the Cooperating Country, shall at all times be in the name of the Cooperating Government, or such public or private agency as the Cooperating Government may designate, unless title to specified types or classes of non-expendable property is reserved to USAID under provisions set forth in the schedule of this contract; but all such property shall be under the custody and control of Contractor until the owner of title directs otherwise, or completion of work under this contract or its termination, at which time custody and control shall be turned over to the owner of title or disposed of in accordance with its instructions. All performance guaranties and warranties obtained from suppliers shall be taken in the name of the title owner. (Non-expendable property is property which is complete in itself, does not lose its identity or become a component part of another article when put into use; is durable, with an expected service life of two years or more; and which has a unit cost of $500 of more.)
                (b) Contractor shall prepare and establish a program, to be approved by the Mission, for the receipt, use, maintenance, protection, custody, and care of non-expendable property for which it has custodial responsibility, including the establishment of reasonable controls to enforce such program.
                (c)(1) For non-expendable property to which title is reserved to the U.S. Government under provisions set forth in the schedule of this contract, Contractor shall submit an annual report on all non-expendable property under its custody as required in the clause of this contract entitled “Government Property”.
                (2) For non-expendable property titled to the Cooperating Government, the Contractor shall, within 90 days after completion of this contract, or at such other date as may be fixed by the contracting officer, submit an inventory schedule covering all items of non-expendable property under its custody, which have not been consumed in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall also indicate what disposition has been made of such property.

                (b) In accordance with USAID regulations and consistent with the regulations of the Maritime Administration, USAID applies Cargo Preference requirements on the basis of program that generally include more than one contract. Thus, the amount of cargo fixed on privately owned U.S.-flag vessels under this contract may be more or less than the required 50 percent, depending on current compliance with Cargo Preference requirements.

                Travel and Transportation (JAN 1990)
                (a) General. The Contractor will be reimbursed for reasonable, allocable and allowable travel and transportation expenses incurred under and for the performance of this contract. Determination of reasonableness, allocability and allowability will be made by the contracting officer based on the applicable cost principles, the Contractor's established policies and procedures, USAID's established policies and procedures for USAID direct-hire employees, and the particular needs of the project being implemented by this contract. The following paragraphs provide specific guidance and limitations on particular items of cost.
                (b) International travel. For travel to and from post of assignment the Contractor shall be reimbursed for travel costs and travel allowances of travelers from place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of the travel from the employee's residence in the United States) to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of travel from the post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's residence) upon completion of services by the individual. Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with the applicable cost principles and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. If a regular employee does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs of going to and from the post of duty for that employee and his/her dependents are not reimbursable hereunder. If the employee serves more than one year but less than the required service in the Cooperating Country (except for reasons beyond his/her control) the costs of going to the post of duty are reimbursable hereunder but the costs of going from post of duty to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other location as approved by the contracting officer are not reimbursable under this contract for the employee and his/her dependents. When travel is by economy class accommodations, the Contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of transporting up to 10 kilograms/22 pounds of accompanied personal baggage per traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the economy ticket provided that the total number of kilograms/pounds of baggage does not exceed that regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel allowances for travelers must not be in excess of the rates authorized in the Department of State Standardized Regulations—hereinafter referred to as the Standardized Regulations—as from time to time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover en route for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with the established practice of the Contractor but not to exceed the amounts stated in the Standardized Regulations.
                (c) Local travel. Reimbursement for local travel in connection with duties directly referable to the contract shall not be in excess of the rates established by the Mission Director for the travel costs of travelers in the Cooperating Country. In the absence of such established rates the Contractor shall be reimbursed for actual travel costs of travelers in the Cooperating Country, if not provided by the Cooperating Government or the Mission, including travel allowances at rates not in excess of those prescribed by the Standardized Regulations.
                (d) Travel for consultation. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the round trip of the Contractor's Chief of Party in the Cooperating Country or other designated Contractor employee or consultant in the Cooperating Country performing services required under this Contract, for travel from the Cooperating Country to the Contractor's office in the United States or to USAID/Washington for consultation and return on occasions deemed necessary by the Contractor and approved in advance, in writing, by the contracting officer or the Mission Director.
                
                (e) Special international travel and third country travel. For special travel which advances the purpose of the contract, which is not otherwise provided by the Cooperating Government, and with the prior written approval of the contracting officer or the Mission Director, the Contractor shall be reimbursed for—
                (i) The travel cost of travelers other than between the United States and the Cooperating Country and for local travel within other countries and
                (ii) Travel allowance for travelers while in travel status and while performing services hereunder in such other countries at rates not in excess of those prescribed by the Standardized Regulations.
                (f) Indirect travel for personal convenience. When travel is performed by an indirect route for the personal convenience of the traveler, the allowable costs of such travel will be computed on the basis of the cost of allowable air fare via the direct usually traveled route. If such costs include fares for air or ocean travel by foreign flag carriers, approval for indirect travel by such foreign flag carriers must be obtained from the contracting officer or the Mission Director before such travel is undertaken, otherwise only that portion of travel accomplished by United States-flag carriers will be reimbursable within the above limitation of allowable costs.
                (g) Limitation on travel by dependents. Travel costs and allowances will be allowed only for dependents of regular employees and such costs shall be reimbursed for travel from place of abode to assigned station in the Cooperating Country and return, only if dependent remains in the country for at least 9 months or one-half of the required tour of duty of the regular employee responsible for such dependent, whichever is greater. If the dependent is eligible for educational travel pursuant to the “Differential and Allowances” clause of this contract, time spent away from post resulting from educational travel will be counted as time at post.
                (h) Delays en route. The Contractor may grant to travelers under this contract reasonable delays en route while in travel status when such delays are caused by events beyond the control of such traveler or Contractor. It is understood that if delay is caused by physical incapacitation, personnel shall be eligible for such sick leave as provided under the “Leave and Holidays” clause of this contract.
                (i) Travel by privately owned automobile. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of travel performed by a regular employee in his/her privately owned automobile at a rate not to exceed that authorized in the Federal Travel Regulations plus authorized per diem for the employee and for each of the authorized dependents traveling in the automobile, if the automobile is being driven to or from the Cooperating Country as authorized under the contract, provided that the total cost of the mileage and the per diem paid to all authorized travelers shall not exceed the total constructive cost of fare and normal per diem by all authorized travelers by surface common carrier or authorized air fare, whichever is less.
                (j) Emergency and irregular travel and transportation. Emergency transportation costs and travel allowances while en route, as provided in this section will also be reimbursed not to exceed amounts authorized by the Foreign Service Travel Regulations for USAID-direct hire employees in like circumstances under the following conditions:
                (1) The costs of going from post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other location for Contractor employees and dependents and returning to the post of duty, when the Contractor's Chief of Party, with the concurrence of the Contracting Officer or Mission Director makes a written determination that such travel is necessary for one of the reasons specified in subparagraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. A copy of the written determination shall be furnished to the contracting officer.
                (i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned, or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty, subject in either case, to the limitations stated in the clause of this contract entitled “Personnel—Physical Fitness of Employee and Dependents.” The Mission Director may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contract expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.
                (ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.
                (2) When, for any reason, the Mission Director determines it is necessary to evacuate the Contractor's entire team (employees and dependents) or Contractor dependents only, the Contractor will be reimbursed for travel and transportation expenses and travel allowance while en route, for the cost of the individuals going from post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other approved location. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the Mission Director when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so.

                (3) The Mission Director may also authorize emergency or irregular travel and transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. The authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and/or household effects, etc. Requests for such emergency travel shall be submitted through the Contractor's Chief of Party.
                (k) Home leave travel. To the extent that home leave has been authorized as provided in the “Leave and Holidays” clause of this contract, the cost of travel for home leave is reimbursable for travel costs and travel allowances of travelers from the post of duty in the Cooperating Country to place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of travel to the employee's residence in the United States) and return to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country. Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with the applicable cost principles and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. When travel is by economy class accommodations, the Contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of transporting up to 10 kilograms/22 pounds of accompanied personal baggage per traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the economy ticket provided that the total number of kilograms/pounds of baggage does not exceed that regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel allowances for travelers shall not be in excess of the rates authorized in the Standardized Regulations as from time to time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover en route for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with the established practice of the Contractor but not to exceed the amounts stated in the Standardized Regulations.
                (l) Rest and recuperation travel. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of travel performed by regular employees and dependents for purposes of rest and recuperation provided that such reimbursement does not exceed that authorized for USAID direct hire employees, and provided further that no reimbursement will be made unless approval is given by the Contractor's Chief of party.
                (m) Transportation of motor vehicles, personal effects and household goods. (1) Transportation, including packing and crating costs, will be paid for shipping from the point of origin in the United States (or other location as approved by the contracting officer) to post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to point of origin in the United States (or other location as approved by the contracting officer) of one privately-owned vehicle for each regular employee, personal effects of travelers and household goods of each regular employee not to exceed the limitations in effect for such shipments for USAID direct hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect when shipment is made.
                (2) If a regular employee does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs for transportation of vehicles, effects and goods to and from the post of duty are not reimbursable hereunder. If the employee serves more than one year but less than the required service in the Cooperating Country (except for reasons beyond his/her control) the costs for transportation of vehicles, effects and goods to the post of duty are reimbursable hereunder but the costs for transportation of vehicles, effects and goods from post of duty to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other location as approved by the contracting officer are not reimbursable under this contract.
                (3) The cost of transporting motor vehicles and household goods shall not exceed the cost of packing, crating and transportation by surface. In the event that the carrier does not require boxing or crating of motor vehicles for shipment to the Cooperating Country, the cost of boxing or crating is not reimbursable. The transportation of a privately-owned motor vehicle for a regular employee may be authorized by the Contractor as replacement of the last such motor vehicle shipped under this contract for the employee when the Mission Director or his/her designee determines in advance and so notifies the Contractor in writing that the replacement is necessary for reasons not due to the negligence or malfeasance of the regular employee. The determination shall be made under the same rules and regulations that apply to Mission employees.
                (n) Unaccompanied baggage. Unaccompanied baggage is considered to be those personal belongings needed by the traveler immediately upon arrival at destination. To permit the arrival of effects to coincide with the arrival of regular employees and dependents, consideration should be given to advance shipments of unaccompanied baggage. The Contractor will be reimbursed for costs of shipment of unaccompanied baggage (in addition to the weight allowance for household effects) not to exceed the limitations in effect for USAID direct hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect when shipment is made.

                This unaccompanied baggage may be shipped as air freight by the most direct route between authorized points of origin and destination regardless of the modes of travel used. This provision is applicable to home leave travel and to short-term employees when these are authorized by the terms of this contract.
                (o) Storage of household effects. The cost of storage charges (including packing, crating, and drayage costs) in the U.S. of household goods of regular employees will be permitted in lieu of transportation of all or any part of such goods to the Cooperating Country under paragraph (m) above provided that the total amount of effects shipped to the Cooperating Country or stored in the U.S. shall not exceed the amount authorized for USAID direct hire employees under the Uniform Foreign Service Travel Regulations.
                (p) International ocean transportation. (1) Flag eligibility requirements for ocean carriage are covered by the “Source and Nationality Requirements” clause of this contract.

                (i) Transportation of goods. Where U.S. flag vessels are not available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the Contractor must contact the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for Management, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, Transportation Division (M/OAA/T) for required guidance and may obtain a release from this requirement from M/OAA/T. The contact email address for these matters is Oceantransportation@USAID.gov.
                
                (ii) Transportation of persons. Where U.S. flag vessels are not available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the Contractor may obtain a release from this requirement from the contracting officer or the Mission Director, as appropriate.
                (2) Transportation of foreign-made vehicles. Reimbursement of the costs of transporting a foreign-made motor vehicle will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Service Travel Regulations.
                (3) Reduced rates on U.S. flag carriers. Reduced rates on United States flag carriers are in effect for shipments of household goods and personal effects of USAID contract personnel. These reduced rates are available provided the shipper states on the bill of lading that the cargo is “Personal property-not for resale-payment of freight charges is at U.S. Government (USAID) expense and any special or diplomatic discounts accorded this type cargo are applicable.” The Contractor will not be reimbursed for shipments of household goods or personal effects in an amount in excess of the reduced rates available in accordance with the foregoing.

              The following clause is for use in all USAID contracts performed in whole or in part overseas.
              
                Marking (JAN 1993)
                (a) It is USAID policy that USAID-financed commodities and shipping containers, and project construction sites and other project locations be suitably marked with the USAID emblem. Shipping containers are also to be marked with the last five digits of the USAID financing document number. As a general rule, marking is not required for raw materials shipped in bulk (such as coal, grain, etc.), or for semifinished products which are not packaged.
                (b) Specific guidance on marking requirements should be obtained prior to procurement of commodities to be shipped, and as early as possible for project construction sites and other project locations. This guidance will be provided through the cognizant technical office indicated on the cover page of this contract, or by the Mission Director in the Cooperating Country to which commodities are being shipped, or in which the project site is located.
                (c) Authority to waive marking requirements is vested with the Regional Assistant Administrators, and with Mission Directors.
                (d) A copy of any specific marking instructions or waivers from marking requirements is to be sent to the contracting officer; the original should be retained by the Contractor.

                Upon arrival in the Cooperation Country, and from time to time as appropriate, the Contractor's Chief of Party shall consult with the Mission Director who shall provide, in writing, the procedure the Contractor and its employees shall follow in the conversion of United States dollars to local currency. This may include, but is not limited to, the conversion of said currency through the cognizant U.S. Disbursing Officer or Mission Controller, as appropriate.

                Orientation and Language Training (APR 1984)
                (a) Regular employees shall receive a maximum of 2 weeks USAID sponsored orientation before travel overseas. The dates of orientation shall be selected by the Contractor from the orientation schedule provided by USAID.
                (b) Participation in USAID sponsored orientation in no way relieves the Contractor of its responsibility for assuring that all employees, regular and short-term, are properly oriented. As an addition to or substitution for USAID's sponsored orientation for regular employees, the following types of orientation may be authorized taking into consideration specific job requirements, the employee's prior overseas experience, or unusual circumstances.
                (1) Modified orientation.
                (2) Language training, particularly when significant for operating capabilities.

                (c) Authorization for an additional or alternate orientation program, if any, shall be either set forth in the schedule or provided in writing by the contracting officer.
                (d) Travel expenses not to exceed one round trip from regular employee's residence to place of orientation and return will be reimbursed, pursuant to the cost principles applicable to this contract. Allowable salary costs during the period of orientation are also reimbursable.

              752.7012
              Protection of the individual as a research subject.
              This clause is for use in any USAID contract which involves research using human subjects.
              
                Protection of the Individual as a Research Subject (AUG 1995)
                (a) Safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects in research conducted under a USAID contract is the responsibility of the contractor. USAID has adopted the Common Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. USAID's Policy is found in Part 225 of Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the “Policy”). Additional interpretation, procedures, and implementation guidance of the Policy are found in USAID General Notice entitled “Procedures for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research Supported by USAID”, issued April 19, 1995, as from time to time amended (a copy of which is attached to this contract). USAID's Cognizant Human Subjects Officer (CHSO) and USAID/W has oversight, guidance, and interpretation responsibility for the Policy.
                (b) Contractors must comply with the Policy when humans are the subject of research, as defined in 22 CFR 225.102(d), performed as part of the contract, and contractors must provide “assurance”, as required by 22 CFR 225.103, that they follow and abide by the procedures in the Policy. See also Section 5 of the April 19, 1995, USAID General Notice which sets forth activities to which the Policy is applicable. The existence of a bona fide, applicable assurance approved by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) such as the “multiple project assurance” (MPA) will satisfy this requirement. Alternatively, contractors can provide an acceptable written assurance to USAID as described in 22 CFR 225.103. Such assurances must be determined by the CHSO to be acceptable prior to any applicable research being initiated or conducted under the contract. In some limited instances outside the U.S., alternative systems for the protection of human subjects may be used provided they are deemed “at least equivalent” to those outlined in part 225 (see 22 CFR 225.101(h)). Criteria and procedures for making this determination are described in the General Notice cited in the preceding paragraph.
                (c) Since the welfare of the research subject is a matter of concern to USAID as well as to the contractor, USAID staff, consultants and advisory groups may independently review and inspect research, and research processes and procedures involving human subjects, and based on such findings, the CHSO may prohibit research which presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with USAID procedures. Informed consent documents must include the stipulation that the subject's records may be subject to such review.

                Contractor-Mission Relationships (OCT 1989)
                (a) The Contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the United States Foreign Assistance Program and agrees that its operations and those of its employees in the Cooperating Country will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibility which this entails.
                (b) The Mission Director is the chief representative of USAID in the Cooperating Country. In this capacity, he/she is responsible for both the total USAID program in the cooperating country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract, and for advising USAID regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the United States Foreign Assistance Program. Although the Contractor will be responsible for all professional, technical, and administrative details of the work called for by the contract, it shall be under the guidance of the Mission Director in matters relating to foreign policy. The Chief of Party shall keep the Mission Director currently informed of the progress of the work under the contract.
                (c) In the event the conduct of any Contractor employee is not in accordance with the preceding paragraphs, the Contractor's Chief of Party shall consult with the Mission Director and the employee involved and shall recommend to the Contractor a course of action with regard to such employee.

                (d) The parties recognize the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct the removal from a country of any U.S. citizen or the discharge from this contract of any third-country national or cooperating-country national when, at the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require. Under these circumstances termination of an employee and replacement by an acceptable substitute shall be at no cost to USAID.

                (e) If it is determined that the services of such employee shall be terminated, the Contractor shall use its best efforts to cause the return of such employee to the United States or point of origin as appropriate.
                
                [The following paragraph (f) is applicable if the contract is with an educational institution:]
                
                (f) It is understood by the parties that the Contractor's responsibilities shall not be restrictive of academic freedom. Notwithstanding these academic freedoms, the Contractor's employees, while in the Cooperating Country, are expected to show respect for its conventions, customs, and institutions, to abide by applicable laws and regulations, and not to interfere in its internal political affairs.

              Use of pouch facilities.
              For use in all USAID non-commercial contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold and involving performance overseas.
              
                Use of Pouch Facilities (JUL 1997)
                (a) Use of diplomatic pouch is controlled by the Department of State. The Department of State has authorized the use of pouch facilities for USAID contractors and their employees as a general policy, as detailed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this clause; however, the final decision regarding use of pouch facilities rests with the Embassy or USAID Mission. In consideration of the use of pouch facilities as hereinafter stated, the Contractor and its employees agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Department of State and USAID against loss or damage occurring in pouch transmission.
                (1) Contractors and their employees are authorized use of the pouch for transmission and receipt of up to a maximum of 0.9 kilogram/2 pounds per shipment of correspondence and documents needed in the administration of foreign assistance programs.
                (2) U.S. citizen employees of U.S. contractors are authorized use of the pouch for personal mail up to a maximum of 0.5 kilogram/one pound per shipment (but see paragraph (a)(3) of this section).
                (3) Merchandise, parcels, magazines, or newspapers are not considered to be personal mail for purposes of this clause, and are not authorized to be sent or received by pouch.
                (4) Official mail as authorized by paragraph (a)(1) of this clause should be addressed as follows: Individual or Organization name, followed by the symbol “C”, city Name of Post, U.S. Agency for International Development, Washington, DC 20523-0001.
                (5) Personal mail pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this clause should be sent to the address specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, but without the name of the organization.
                (6) Mail sent via the diplomatic pouch may not be in violation of U.S. Postal laws and may not contain material ineligible for pouch transmission.

                (7) USAID contractor personnel are not authorized use of military postal facilities (APO/FPO). This is an Adjutant General's decision based on existing laws and regulations governing military postal facilities and is being enforced worldwide. Posts having access to APO/FPO facilities and using such for diplomatic pouch dispatch, may, however, accept official mail from Contractors and letter mail from their employees for the pouch, provided of course, adequate postage is affixed.
                (b) The Contractor shall be responsible for advising its employees of this authorization and these guidelines and limitations on use of pouch facilities.
                (c) Specific additional guidance on use of pouch facilities in accordance with this clause is available from the Post Communication Center at the Embassy or USAID Mission.

                Health and Accident Coverage for USAID Participant Trainees (JAN 1999)
                (a) In accordance with the requirements of USAID Automated Directive System (ADS) 253, the Contractor shall enroll all non-U.S. trainees (hereinafter referred to as “participants”), whose training in the U.S. is financed by USAID under this contract, in USAID's Health and Accident Coverage (HAC) program. Sponsored trainees enrolled in third-country or in-country training events are not eligible for USAID's HAC program, but the Contractor may obtain alternative local medical and accident insurance at contract expense, provided the cost is consistent with the cost principles in (48 CFR) FAR 31.2.
                (b) When enrollment in the HAC program is required per paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor must enroll each participant in the HAC program through one of two designated contractors prior to the initiation of travel by the participant. USAID has developed an Agency-wide database training management system, the Training Results and Information Network (“TraiNet”), which is the preferred system for managing USAID's participant training program, including enrollment in the HAC program. However, until such time as the USAID sponsoring unit (as defined in ADS 253) has given the Contractor access to USAID's “TraiNet” software for trainee tracking and HAC enrollment, the Contractor must fill out and mail the Participant Data Form (PDF) (Form USAID 1381-4) to USAID. The Contractor can obtain information regarding each HAC program contractor, including contact information, and a supply of the PDF forms and instructions for completing and submitting them, by contacting the data base contractor serving the Director, Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and Environment, Office of Education (E3/ED).
                (c) The Contractor must ensure that HAC enrollment begins immediately upon the participant's departure for the United States for the purpose of participating in a training program financed by USAID, and that enrollment continues in full force and effect until the participant returns to his/her country of origin, or is released from USAID's responsibility, whichever is the sooner.
                (1) The HAC insurance provider, not the Contractor, shall be responsible for paying all reasonable and necessary medical reimbursement charges not otherwise covered by student health service or other insurance programs, subject to the availability of funds for such purposes, in accordance with the standards of coverage established by USAID under its HAC program and by the HAC providers' contracts.
                (2) After HAC enrollment, upon receipt of HAC services invoice from the selected HAC provider, the Contractor shall submit payment directly to the HAC provider.
                (3) The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that participants and any stakeholders (as defined in ADS 253) are advised that USAID is not responsible for any medical claims in excess of the coverages provided by the HAC program, or for medical claims not eligible for coverage under the HAC program, or not otherwise covered in this section.
                (d) The Contractor, to the extent that it is an educational institution with a mandatory student health service program, shall also enroll participants in that institution's student health service program. Medical costs which are covered under the institution's student health service shall not be eligible for payment under USAID's HAC program.
                (e) If the Contractor has a mandatory, non-waivable health and accident insurance program for students, the costs of such insurance will be allowable under this contract. Any claims eligible under such insurance will not be payable under USAID's HAC plan or under this contract. Even though the participant is covered by the Contractor's mandatory, non-waivable health and accident insurance program, the participant MUST be enrolled in USAID's more comprehensive HAC program.

                (f) Medical conditions pre-existing to the participant's sponsorship for training by USAID, discovered during the required pre-departure medical examination, are grounds for ineligibility for sponsorship unless specifically waived by the sponsoring unit, and covered through a separate insurance policy maintained by the participant or his employer, or a letter of guarantee from the participant or the employer (which thereby assumes liability for any related charges that might materialize. See ADS 253).

                Changes in Tuition and Fees (APR 1984)
                While educational programs for participants will be established utilizing the Contractor's currently applicable tuition and fee schedule, the parties understand that such standard tuition and fees may be subject to change during the course of the program. If such event results in an increase in the cost of the program, USAID agrees to pay such increased standard tuition and fees in the next applicable academic term as a condition for the continuation of the program. If such change results in a decrease in the cost of the program, the Contractor agrees to charge to USAID only the amount of such revised standard tuition and fees in the next applicable academic term. The Contractor shall undertake to keep USAID currently advised as to changes in its standard tuition and fees. At such time as increases in the amounts of tuition and fees results in there being inadequate funds remaining in this contract to meet the costs of the next academic term, the Contractor will so advise USAID. USAID may then provide such additional funds as required to complete the program.

                (a) The Government may, at its option and at any time, withdraw any student.

                (c) If such withdrawal occurs prior to the end of a term, the Government shall pay any tuition and fees due for the current term in which the student may be enrolled, and the Contractor shall credit the Government with any charges eligible for refund under the Contractor's standard procedures for civilian students in effect on the effective date of such withdrawal.
                (d) Withdrawal of students by the Government shall not be the basis for any special charge or claim by the Contractor other than as provided by the Contractor's standard procedures.

                [The following paragraphs (f) and (g) are applicable only to cost reimbursement contracts.]
                
                (f) Duration of appointments. (1) Regular employees will normally be appointed for a minimum of 2 years which period includes orientation (less language training) in the United States and authorized international travel under the contract except:
                (i) An appointment may be made for less than 2 years if the contract has less than 2 years but more than 1 year to run provided that if the contract is extended the appointment shall also be extended to the full 2 years. This provision shall be reflected in the employment agreement prior to employment under this contract.
                (ii) When a 2-year appointment is not required, appointment may be made for less than 2 years but in no event less than 1 year.
                (iii) When the normal tour of duty established for USAID personnel at a particular post is less than 2 years, then a normal appointment under this contract may be of the same duration.

                (iv) When the contractor is unable to make appointments of regular employees for a full 2 years, the contractor may make appointments of less than 2 but not less than 1 year, provided that such appointment is approved by the contracting officer.
                (2) Services required for less than 1 year will be considered short-term appointments and the employee will be considered a short-term employee.
                (g) Employment of dependents. If any person who is employed for services in the Cooperating Country under this contract is either (1) a dependent of an employee of the U.S. Government working in the Cooperating Country, or (2) a dependent of a contractor employee working under a contract with the U.S. Government in the Cooperating Country, such person shall continue to hold the status of a dependent. He or she shall be entitled to salary for the time services are actually performed in the Cooperating Country, and differential and allowances as established by the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas).

              Differential and allowances.
              The following clause is for use in all USAID cost reimbursement contracts performed in whole or in part overseas.
              
                Differentials and Allowances (JUL 1996)

                (This clause does not apply to TCN or CCN employees. TCN and CCN employees are not eligible for differentials and allowances, unless specifically authorized by the cognizant Assistant Administrator or Mission Director. A copy of such authorization shall be retained and made available as part of the contractor's records which are required to be preserved and made available by the “Examination of Records by the Comptroller General” and “Audit” clauses of this contract).
                
                (a) Post differential. Post differential is an additional compensation for service at places in foreign areas where conditions of environment differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States and warrant additional compensation as a recruitment and retention incentive. In areas where post differential is paid to USAID direct-hire employees, post differential not to exceed the percentage of salary as is provided such USAID employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 500 (except the limitation contained in Section 552, “Ceiling on Payment”) Tables-Chapter 900, as from time to time amended, will be reimbursable hereunder for employees in respect to amounts earned during the time such employees actually spend overseas on work under this contract. When such post differential is provided to regular employees of the Contractor, it shall be payable beginning on the date of arrival at the post of assignment and continue, including periods away from post on official business, until the close of business on the day of departure from post of assignment en route to the United States. Sick or vacation leave taken at or away from the post of assignment will not interrupt the continuity of the assignment or require a discontinuance of such post differential payments, provided such leave is not taken within the United States or the territories of the United States. Post differential will not be payable while the employee is away from his/her post of assignment for purposes of home leave. Short-term employees shall be entitled to post differential beginning with the forty-third (43rd) day at post.
                (b) Living quarters allowance. Living quarters allowance is an allowance granted to reimburse an employee for substantially all of his/her cost for either temporary or residence quarters whenever Government-owned or Government-rented quarters are not provided to him/her at his/her post without charge. Such costs are those incurred for temporary lodging (temporary lodging allowance) or one unit of residence quarters (living quarters allowance) and include rent, plus any costs not included therein for heat, light, fuel, gas, electricity and water. The temporary lodging allowance and the living quarters allowance are never both payable to an employee for the same period of time. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for a living quarters allowance for rent and utilities if such facilities are not supplied. Such allowance shall not exceed the amount paid USAID employees of equivalent rank in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with either the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 130, as from time to time amended, or other rates approved by the Mission Director. Subject to the written approval of the Mission Director, short-term employees may be paid per diem (in lieu of living quarters allowance) at rates prescribed by the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, during the time such short-term employees spend at posts of duty in the Cooperating Country under this contract. In authorizing such per diem rates, the Mission Director shall consider the particular circumstances involved with respect to each such short-term employee including the extent to which meals and/or lodging may be made available without charge or at nominal cost by an agency of the United States Government or of the Cooperating Government, and similar factors.
                
                (c) Temporary quarters subsistence allowance. Temporary quarters subsistence allowance is a quarters allowance granted to an employee for the reasonable cost of temporary quarters incurred by the employee and his family for a period not in excess of (i) 90 days after first arrival at a new post in a foreign area or a period ending with the occupation of residence (permanent) quarters, if earlier, and (ii) 30 days immediately preceding final departure from the post subsequent to the necessary vacating of residence quarters, unless an extension is authorized in writing by the Mission Director. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees and authorized dependents for temporary quarters subsistence allowance, in lieu of living quarters allowance, not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 120, as from time to time amended.
                (d) Post allowance. Post allowance is a cost-of-living allowance granted to an employee officially stationed at a post where the cost of living, exclusive of quarters cost, is substantially higher than in Washington, DC. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for post allowance not to exceed those paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 220, as from time to time amended.
                (e) Supplemental post allowance. Supplemental post allowance is a form of post allowance granted to an employee at his/her post when it is determined that assistance is necessary to defray extraordinary subsistence costs. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees for supplemental post allowance not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 230, as from time to time amended.
                (f) Educational allowance. Educational allowance is an allowance to assist an employee in meeting the extraordinary and necessary expenses, not otherwise compensated for, incurred by reason of his/her service in a foreign area in providing adequate elementary and secondary education for his/her children. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for educational allowances for their dependent children in amounts not to exceed those set forth in the Standardized (Regulations Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 270, as from time to time amended.
                (g) Educational travel. Educational travel is travel to and from a school in the United States for secondary education (in lieu of an educational allowance) and for college education. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for educational travel for their dependent children provided such payment does not exceed that which would be payable in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 280, as from time to time amended. Educational travel shall not be authorized for regular employees whose assignment is less than two years.
                (h) Separate maintenance allowance. Separate maintenance allowance is an allowance to assist an employee who is compelled, by reason of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at his/her post of assignment in a foreign area, or for the convenience of the Government, to meet the additional expense of maintaining his/her dependents elsewhere than at such post. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for a separate maintenance allowance not to exceed that made to Aid employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 260, as from time to time amended.
                (i) Payments during evacuation. The Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) provide the authority for efficient, orderly, and equitable procedure for the payment of compensation, post differential and allowances in the event of an emergency evacuation of employees or their dependents, or both, from duty stations for military or other reasons or because of imminent danger to their lives. If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission Director the Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees and authorized dependents evacuated from their post of assignment in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended.
                (j) Danger pay allowance. (1) The contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to its employees for danger pay not to exceed that paid USAID employees in the cooperating country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 650, as from time to time amended.

                (2) Danger pay is an allowance that provides additional compensation above basic compensation to an employee in a foreign area where civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism or wartime conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. The danger pay allowance is in lieu of that part of the post differential which is attributable to political violence. Consequently, the post differential may be reduced while danger pay is in effect to avoid dual crediting for political violence.

                Post Privileges (JUL 1993)
                (a) Routine health room services may be available, subject to post policy, to U.S. citizen contractors and their authorized dependents (regardless of citizenship) at the post of duty. These services do not include hospitalization, or predeparture or end of tour medical examinations. The services normally include such medications as may be available, immunizations and preventive health measures, diagnostic examinations and advice, and home visits as medically indicated. Emergency medical treatment is provided to U.S. citizen employees and dependents, whether or not they may have been granted access to routine health room services, on the same basis as it would be to any U.S. citizen in an emergency medical situation in the country.
                (b) Privileges such as the use of APO, PX's, commissaries, and officer's clubs are established at posts abroad pursuant to agreements between the U.S. and Cooperating Governments. These facilities are intended for and usually limited to members of the official U.S. establishment including the Embassy, USAID Mission, U.S. Information Service, and the Military. Normally, the agreements do not permit these facilities to be made available to nonofficial Americans.

                Inspection Trips by Contractor's Officers and Executives (APR 1984)
                Provided it is approved by the Mission Director, the Contractor may send the Campus Coordinator, a professional member of its staff as an alternate to the Campus Coordinator, or such of its senior officials (e.g., president, vice presidents, deans, or department heads) to the Cooperating Country as may be required to review the progress of the work under this contract. Except for the Campus Coordinator or his/her alternate, no direct salary charges will be paid hereunder with respect to any such officials.

              For use in all USAID cost-reimbursement contracts for technical or professional services.
              
                Leave and Holidays (OCT 1989)
                (a) Vacation leave. (1) The Contractor may grant to its employees working under this contract vacations of reasonable duration in accordance with the Contractor's practice for its employees, but in no event shall such vacation leave be earned at a rate exceeding 26 work days per annum. Reimbursement for vacation leave is limited to the amount earned by employees while serving under this contract.
                For regular employees during their tour of duty in the Cooperating Country, vacation leave is provided under this contract primarily for purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation. The Contractor's Chief of Party, the employee and the Cooperating Country institution associated with this project shall develop vacation leave schedules early in the employee's tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors.
                (2) Leave taken during the concluding weeks of an employee's tour shall be included in the established leave schedule and be limited to that amount of leave which can be earned during a twelve-month period unless approved in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this clause.
                (3) Vacation leave earned but not taken by the end of the employee's tour pursuant to paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this clause will be forfeited unless the requirements of the project precluded the employee from taking such leave, and the contracting officer (with the endorsement of the Mission) approves one of the following as an alternative:
                (i) Taking, during the concluding weeks of the employee's tour, leave not permitted under (a)(2) of this section, or
                (ii) Lump-sum payment for leave not taken provided such leave does not exceed the number of days which can be earned by the employee during a twelve-month period.
                (b) Sick Leave. Sick leave is earned by employees in accordance with the Contractor's usual practice but not to exceed 13 work days per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Additional sick leave after use of accrued vacation leave may be advanced in accordance with Contractor's usual practice, if in the judgment of the Contractor's Chief of Party it is determined that such additional leave is in the best interest of the project. In no event shall such additional leave exceed 30 days. The Contractor agrees to reimburse USAID for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the employee's assignment under this contract. Sick leave earned and unused at the end of a regular tour of duty may be carried over to an immediately-succeeding tour of duty under this contract. The use of home leave authorized under this clause shall not constitute a break in service for the purpose of sick leave carry-over. Contractor employees will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of their duties under this contract.
                (c) Home leave. (1) Home leave is leave earned for service abroad for use only in the United States, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or in the possessions of the United States.
                (2) A regular employee who is a U.S. citizen or resident and has served at least 2 years overseas, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this clause, under this contract and has not taken more than 30 workdays leave (vacation, sick, or leave without pay) in the United States, may be granted home leave of not more than 15 workdays for each such year of service overseas, provided that such regular employee agrees to return overseas upon completion of home leave under an additional 2 year appointment, or for a shorter period of not less than 1 year of overseas service under the contract if the Mission Director has approved in advance. Home leave must be taken in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the United States; any days spent elsewhere will be charged to vacation leave or leave without pay.
                (3) Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph (c)(2), of this clause, that the Contractor's regular employee must have served 2 years overseas under this contract to be eligible for home leave, Contractor may grant advance home leave to such regular employee subject to all of the following conditions:
                (i) Granting of advance home leave would in each case serve to advance the attainment of the objectives of this contract;
                (ii) The regular employee shall have served a minimum of 18 months in the Cooperating Country on his/her current tour of duty under this contract; and
                (iii) The regular employee shall have agreed to return to the Cooperating Country to serve out the remainder of his/her current tour of duty and an additional 2 year appointment under this contract, or such other additional appointment of not less than 1 year of overseas service as the Mission Director may approve.
                (4) The period of service overseas required under paragraph (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this clause shall include the actual days spent in orientation in the United States (less language training) and the actual days overseas beginning on the date of departure from the United States port of embarkation on international travel and continuing, inclusive of authorized delays en route, to the date of arrival at the United States port of debarkation from international travel. Allowable vacation and sick leave taken while overseas, but not leave without pay, shall be included in the required period of service overseas. An amount equal to the number of days vacation and sick leave taken in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the United States will be added to the required period of service overseas.
                (5) Salary during travel to and from the United States for home leave will be limited to the time required for travel by the most expeditious air route. The Contractor will be responsible for reimbursing USAID for salary payments made during home leave if in spite of the undertaking of the new appointment the regular employee, except for reasons beyond his/her control as determined by the contracting officer, does not return overseas and complete the additional required service. Unused home leave is not reimbursable under this contract.
                (6) To the extent deemed necessary by the Contractor, regular employees in the United States on home leave may be authorized to spend not more than 5 days in work status for consultation at home office/campus or at USAID/Washington before returning to their post of duty.

                (The requirements of this provision do not apply to employees hired in the Cooperating Country or to authorized dependents who were already in the Cooperating Country when their sponsoring employee was hired.)
                (a) Assignments of less than 60 days in the Cooperating Country. The contractor shall require employees being assigned to the Cooperating Country for less than 60 days to be examined by a licensed doctor of medicine. The contractor shall require the doctor to provide to the contractor a written statement that in his/her medical opinion the employee is physically qualified to engage in the type of activity for which he/she is employed and the employee is physically able to reside in the country to which he/she is assigned. Under a cost reimbursement contract, if the contractor has no written statement of medical opinion on file prior to the departure for the Cooperating Country of any employee and such employee is unable to perform the type of activity for which he/she is employed or cannot complete his/her tour of duty because of any physical disability (other than physical disability arising from an accident while employed under this contract), the contractor shall be responsible for returning the disabled employee to his/her point of hire and providing a replacement at no additional cost to the Government. In addition, in the case of a cost reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not be entitled to reimbursement for any additional costs attributable to delays or other circumstances caused by the employee's inability to complete his/her tour of duty.
                (b) Assignments of 60 days or more in the Cooperating Country. (1) The contracting officer shall provide the contractor with a reproducible copy of the “USAID Contractor Employee Physical Examination Form”. Information required by the Paperwork Reduction Act for reporting the burden estimate, the points of contact regarding burden estimate, and the OMB approval expiration date, are printed on the form. The contractor shall reproduce the form as required, and provide a copy to each employee and authorized dependent proposed for assignments of 60 days or more in the Cooperating Country. The contractor shall have the employee and all authorized dependents obtain a physical examination from a licensed physician, who will complete the form for each individual. The employee will deliver the physical examination form(s) to the embassy health unit in the Cooperating Country.
                (2) (The following information is provided for two purposes: To assist fixed price offerors to develop their price proposal, and to provide cost reimbursement contractors with guidance in determining reasonable and allowable costs.) As a contribution to the cost of medical examinations, USAID shall reimburse the contractor for the physical examination authorized in paragraph (a) of this section in an amount not to exceed $100 for the physical examination, plus reimbursement of charges for immunizations to the extent not covered by the contractor's health insurance policy. For physical examinations authorized in paragraph (b)(1) above, the USAID contribution to the cost of the examination shall be as follows:

                (i) For the employee and authorized dependents 12 years of age and over, one half of the cost of each examination up to a maximum USAID share of $300 per individual, plus reimbursement of charges for immunizations to the extent not covered by the contractor's health insurance policy.
                (ii) For authorized dependents under 12 years of age, one half of the cost of each examination up to a maximum USAID share of $120 per individual, plus reimbursement of charges for immunizations to the extent not covered by the contractor's health insurance policy.
                (iii) The contractor must obtain the prior written approval of the contracting officer to receive any USAID contributions higher than these limits.

(1) The contractor may access the IPN Portal at any time to review all IPN Portal modifications; however, the system will also notify the contractor by email when the USAID IPN Portal Administrator uploads a universal bilateral modification for contractor review and signature. Proposed IPN Portal modifications distributed through the IPN Portal are applicable to all awards, unless otherwise noted in the proposed modification.
                (2) Within 15 calendar days from receipt of the notification email from the IPN Portal, the contractor must do one of the following:

                (3) Within 30 calendar days of receipt of a signed modification from the contractor, the contracting officer must provide the fully executed modification to the contractor or initiate discussions with the contractor. Bilateral modifications provided through the IPN Portal are not effective until both the contractor and the contracting officer sign the modification.

                (a) Implementation of activities under this award may involve children, or personnel engaged in the implementation of the award may come into contact with children, which could raise the risk of child abuse, exploitation, or neglect within this award.

                (5) Promote child-safe screening procedures for personnel, particularly personnel whose work brings them in direct contact with children; and
                
                (6) Have a procedure for ensuring that personnel and others recognize child abuse, exploitation, or neglect; mandating that personnel and others report allegations; investigating and managing allegations; and taking appropriate action in response to such allegations, including, but not limited to, dismissal of personnel.
                (b) The contractor must also include in the code of conduct for all personnel implementing USAID-funded activities, the child safeguarding principles in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this clause.

                (2) Child abuse, exploitation, or neglect. Constitutes any form of physical abuse; emotional ill-treatment; sexual abuse; neglect or insufficient supervision; trafficking; or commercial, transactional, labor, or other exploitation resulting in actual or potential harm to the child's health, well-being, survival, development, or dignity. It includes, but is not limited to: Any act or failure to act which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm to a child, or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm to a child.
                (3) Emotional abuse or ill treatment. Constitutes injury to the psychological capacity or emotional stability of the child caused by acts, threats of acts, or coercive tactics. Emotional abuse may include, but is not limited to: Humiliation, control, isolation, withholding of information, or any other deliberate activity that makes the child feel diminished or embarrassed.
                (4) Exploitation. Constitutes the abuse of a child where some form of remuneration is involved or whereby the perpetrators benefit in some manner. Exploitation represents a form of coercion and violence that is detrimental to the child's physical or mental health, development, education, or well-being.
                (5) Neglect. Constitutes failure to provide for a child's basic needs within USAID-funded activities that are responsible for the care of a child in the absence of the child's parent or guardian.
                (6) Physical abuse. Constitutes acts or failures to act resulting in injury (not necessarily visible), unnecessary or unjustified pain or suffering without causing injury, harm or risk of harm to a child's health or welfare, or death. Such acts may include, but are not limited to: Punching, beating, kicking, biting, shaking, throwing, stabbing, choking, or hitting (regardless of object used), or burning. These acts are considered abuse regardless of whether they were intended to hurt the child.
                (7) Sexual abuse. Constitutes fondling a child's genitals, penetration, incest, rape, sodomy, indecent exposure, and exploitation through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials.
                (d) The contractor must insert this clause in all subcontracts under this award.

            Appendix D to Chapter 7—Direct USAID Contracts With a U.S. Citizen or a U.S. Resident Alien for Personal Services Abroad
            1. General. (a) Purpose. This appendix sets forth the authority, policy, and procedures under which USAID contracts with a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.
            (b) Definitions. (1) Personal services contract (PSC) means a contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).
            (2) Employer-employee relationship means an employment relationship under a service contract with an individual which occurs when, as a result of the contract's terms or the manner of its administration during performance, the contractor is subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.
            (3) Non-person services contract means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees.
            (4) Independent contractor relationship means a contract relationship in which the contractor is not subject to the supervision and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. Under this relationship, the Government does not normally supervise the performance of the work, control the days of the week or hours of the day in which it is to be performed, or the location of performance.
            (5) Resident hire means a U.S. citizen who, at the time of hire as a PSC, resides in the cooperating country as a spouse or dependent of a U.S. citizen employed by a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-financed contract or agreement, or for reasons other than for employment with a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-financed contract or agreement. A U.S. citizen for purposes of this definition also includes persons who at the time of contracting are lawfully admitted permanent residents of the United States.
            (6) U.S. resident alien means a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States.
            (7) Abroad means outside the United States and its territories and possessions.
            (8) USAID direct-hire employees means civilian employees appointed under USAID Handbook 25 procedures or superseding Automated Directive System (ADS) Chapters.
            
            2. Legal Basis. (a) Section 635(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the “FAA”) provides the Agency's contracting authority.
            (b) Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2396(a)(3)) authorizes the Agency to enter into personal services contracts with individuals for personal services abroad and provides further that such individuals “* * * shall not be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Civil Service Commission.” 1
              
            
            
              
                1 The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of Personnel Management.
            
            
            3. Applicability. (a) This appendix applies to all personal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens to provide assistance abroad under Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA.
            
            (b) This appendix does not apply to:
            (1) Nonpersonal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens; such contracts are covered by the basic text of the FAR (48 CFR Chapter 1) and the AIDAR (48 CFR chapter 7).
            (2) Personal services contracts with individual Cooperating Country Nationals (CCNs) or Third Country Nationals (TCNs). Such contracts are covered by Appendix J of this chapter.
            (3) Other personal services arrangements covered by USAID Handbook 25—Employment and Promotion or superseding ADS Chapters.

            (4) Interagency agreements (e.g., PASAs and RSSAs covered by ADS 306—Interagency Agreements.
            
            4. Policy. (a) General. USAID may finance, with either program or operating expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services contracts as part of the Agency's program of foreign assistance by entering into a direct contract with an individual U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.
            (1) Program funds. Under the authority of Section 635(h) of the FAA, program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.
            (2) Operating Expense Funds. Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these funds were obligated. Non-recurring cost items may be forward funded for periods not to exceed twenty-four (24) months where necessary and appropriate to accomplishment of the work. 2
              
            
            
              
                2 If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years also but funded only as outlined in paragraph 4(a) of this appendix.
            
            (b) Limitations on Personal Services Contracts. (1) Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.
            (2) Personal services contracts may be used for commercial activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.
            (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, regulations or delegations, U.S. citizen personal services contractors (USPSCs) may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or responsibility delegable to U.S. citizen direct-hire employees (USDH employees) except that:
            a. They may not supervise U.S. direct-hire employees of USAID or other U.S. Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. citizen employees.
            b. They may not be designated as Contracting Officers or delegated authority to sign obligating or subobligating documents.
            c. They may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a USDH employee.
            d. They may participate in personnel selection matters, but may not be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.
            e. Exceptions to the limitations in this paragraph (b)(3) must be approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).
            (c) Withholdings and Fringe Benefits. (1) Personal services contractors (PSCs) are Government employees for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code) and are, therefore, subject to social security (FICA) and Federal income tax (FIT) withholdings. As employees, they are ineligible for the “foreign earned income” exclusion under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).
            (2) Personal services contractors are treated on par with other Government employees, except for programs based on any law administered by the Federal Office of Personnel Management (e.g., incentive awards, life insurance, health insurance, and retirement programs covered by 5 CFR Parts 530, 531, 831, 870, 871, and 890). While PSCs are ineligible to participate in any of these programs, the following fringe benefits are provided as a matter of policy:
            (i) The employer's FICA contribution for retirement purposes.
            (ii) A contribution against the actual cost of the PSC's annual health and life insurance costs. Proof of health and life insurance coverage and its actual cost to the PSC shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is made. (See also paragraph 4(c)(3) of this appendix.)
            (A) The contribution for health insurance shall not exceed 50% of the actual cost to the PSC for his/her annual health insurance, or the maximum U.S. Government contribution for a direct-hire employee, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management, whichever is less. If the PSC is covered under a spouse's health insurance plan, where the spouse's employer pays some or all of the health insurance costs, the cost to the PSC for annual health insurance shall be considered to be zero.
            (B) The contribution for life insurance shall be up to 50% of the actual annual costs to the PSC for life insurance, not to exceed $500.00 per year.

            (iii) PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability adjustment as U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of funds.
            
            (iv) PSCs shall receive a 3% annual salary increase subject to satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluation. Such increase may not exceed 3% without a deviation. This 3% limitation also applies to extensions of the same service or negotiations for a new contract for the same or similar services unless a deviation has been approved.
            (v) PSCs shall receive the following allowances and differentials provided in the State Department's Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians Foreign Areas) on the same basis as U.S. Government employees (except for U.S. resident hires, see paragraph 4(d) and Section 12, General Provisions, Clause 22, “U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors”):
            (A) Temporary lodging allowance (Section 120), 3
              
            
            
              
                3 Mission Directors may authorize per diem in lieu of these allowances.
            
            (B) Living quarters allowance (Section 130), 3
            
            (C) Post allowance (Section 220), 3
            
            (D) Supplemental post allowance (Section 230), 3
            
            (E) Separate maintenance allowance (Section 260), 4
              
            
            
              
                4 These allowances are not authorized for short tours (i.e., less than a year).
            
            (F) Education allowance (Section 270), 4
            
            (G) Educational travel (Section 280), 4
            
            (H) Post differential (Section 500),
            (I) Payments during evacuation/authorized departure (Section 600), and
            (J) Danger pay (Section 650).
            (vi) Any allowance or differential that is not expressly stated in paragraph 4(c)(2)(v) is not authorized for any PSC unless a deviation is approved. The only exception is a consumables allowance if authorized for the post under Handbook 22 or superseding ADS Chapter.
            (vii) Health room services may be provided in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Physical Fitness and Health Room Privileges.”
            (viii) PSCs are eligible to receive benefits for injury, disability, or death under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act since the law is administered by the Department of Labor not the Office of Personnel Management.
            (ix) PSCs are eligible to earn four hours of annual leave and four hours of sick leave for each two week period. However, PSCs with previous PSC service (not previous U.S. Government civilian or military service) earn either six hours of annual leave for each two week period if their previous PSC service exceeds 3 years (including 10 hours annual leave for the final pay period of a calendar year), or eight hours of annual leave for each two week period if their previous PSC service exceeds 15 years.
            (3) A PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraph 4(c)(2)(ii) of this appendix.
            (4) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contract (since the Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree) unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. If coverage overseas is excluded, then eligibility as cited in paragraph 4(c)(3) applies.
            (5) Retired U.S. Government employees may be awarded Personal Services Contracts without any reduction in or offset against their Government annuity.
            (d) U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors. U.S. resident-hire PSCs are not eligible for any fringe benefits (except contributions for FICA, health insurance, and life insurance), including differentials and allowances unless such individuals can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that they have received similar benefits and allowances from their immediately previous employer in the cooperating country, or the Mission Director may determine that payment of such benefits would be consistent with the Mission's policy and practice and would be in the best interests of the U.S. Government.
            (e) Determining salary for personal services contractors. (1) There are two separate and distinct methods of establishing a salary for personal services contractors. Use of method number 1 is required unless justified and approved as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii).
            (i) Method 1: Salaries for Personal Services Contractors shall be established based on the market value in the United States of the position being recruited for. This requires the Contracting Officer in coordination with the Technical Officer to determine the correct market value (a salary range) of the position to be filled. This method is required in establishing salary for all PSCs unless method 2 is authorized as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii). Contract Information Bulletin (CIB) 96-8 dated February 23, 1996 provides a guide which contains information concerning Preparation of Scopes of Work, Determination of Salary Class Grade, Salary Class Bench Marks and Salary Class Review. The market value of the position then becomes the basis along with the applicants' certified salary history on the SF 171, “Personal Qualifications Statement” for salary negotiations by the Contracting Officer. The SF 171 must be retained in the permanent contract file. Any position which is determined to be above the GS-13 equivalent and exceeds six months in duration must be classified by M/HR/POD. The crucial point is the establishment of a realistic and reasonable market value for a job. The final determination regarding the reasonableness of a salary level rests with the Contracting Officer. Paying salaries using this method avoids “rank in person” salaries which are in excess of the value of the job being contracted for.
            (ii) Method 2: If approved in writing by the Mission Director or the cognizant Assistant Administrator, based on written justification, salary may be negotiated based on the applicant's current earnings adjusted in accordance with the factors set out in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) (A) through (C). This approval requirement cannot be redelegated. Current earnings must be certified by the contractor on the SF 171, (see paragraph 6(b)(3) of this appendix). This is guidance for establishing initial salaries, not subsequent increases, for the same contractor performing the same function.
            (A) As a rule, up to a 3 percent increase above current earnings may be given. However, a 3 percent increase is awarded only to a PSC whose earnings are based on a period of twelve months or more; 2 percent for established earnings of less than twelve months but not less than four months; or 1 percent for established earnings during the past four months.
            (B) Additional percentages may be given for the following factors. If a PSC has worked in a developing country for more than two years, an additional 1 percent may be awarded. Education related to the area of specialization and above the minimum qualification required may warrant an additional 1 percent, and those specialties for which there is keen competition in the employment market or a serious shortage category nationwide may be awarded an additional 2 percent. In addition, related technical experience over 5 years may increase the percentage by 1 and over ten years by 3.
            (C) All requests for an initial rate of pay above 10 percent over current earnings must be approved in writing by the appropriate Assistant Administrator or Mission Director. Current earnings are actual earnings for work reasonably related to the position for which the applicant is being considered. Paragraphs 4(e)(1)(ii) (A) through (C) apply only to salary setting method number 2 in paragraph 4 (e)(1)(ii).
            (2) When an applicant has no current earnings history (e.g., a person returning to the workforce after an absence of a number of years) or when an applicant's current earnings history doesn't accurately reflect the applicant's job market worth (e.g., a Peace Corps volunteer), every effort should be made to establish a market value for the position as a basis for negotiation, notwithstanding the lack of a current earnings history, provided that the applicant has the full qualifications for the job and could command a similar salary in the open job market.
            (3) This appendix applies the “USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST)” policy in Automated Directives System (ADS) Chapter 302.3.6.8 to salaries for U.S. PSCs. Salaries in excess of the USAID CST, which is equivalent to the maximum rate for Federal agencies without a certified SES performance appraisal system, must be approved by the M/OAA Director in accordance with the approval procedures in ADS 302.3.6.8(e). This approval cannot be re-delegated.
            (f) Incentive awards. U.S. PSCs are not eligible to receive monetary awards. They are eligible for non-monetary awards such as certificates.
            (g) Annual salary increase. PSC contracts written for more than one year should provide for a 3% annual increase based on satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluations.
            (h) Pay comparability adjustment. PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability adjustment as that received by U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of funds.
            (i) Subcontracting. PSCs are U.S. Government employees and may not be called upon (or permitted) to subcontract out any part of their work. Funds for subcontracting have no place in the budget of a personal services contract. Support services, equipment, and supplies (e.g., typing and report preparation, paper, pens, computers, and furniture) should be furnished to PSCs just as they would be to direct-hire employees. To the extent that direct-hire personnel may be authorized to purchase supporting services or supplies under a travel authorization, so may PSCs; otherwise, contracts for personal services should not contain any funds for procurement.
            
            5. Soliciting for Personal Services Contracts. (a) Technical Officer's responsibilities. The Technical Officer will prepare a written detailed statement of duties and a statement of minimum qualifications to cover the position being recruited for. The statement shall be included in the procurement request (the Acquisition & Assistance Request Document) e.g., the request shall also include the following additional information as a minimum:
            (1) The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of frequency);
            (2) The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, plus any options for renewal or extension;

            (3) The basic education, training, experience, and skills required for the position;
            
            (4) An estimate of what a comparable GS/FS equivalent position should cost, including basic salary, allowances, and differentials, if appropriate; and
            (5) A list of Government or host country furnished items (e.g., housing).
            (b) Contracting Officer's responsibilities. (1) The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall contain:
            (i) Three sets of SF 171s and SF 171As. (Upon receipt, one copy of each SF 171 and SF 171A shall be forwarded to the Project Officer.)
            (ii) A detailed statement of duties or a completed position description for the position being recruited for.
            (iii) A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract Schedule, General Provisions as appropriate, as well as the FAR Clauses to be incorporated in full text and by reference.
            (iv) A copy of the USAID General Notice entitled “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct”.
            (2) The Contracting Officer shall comply with the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) except those recruited from the U.S.
            (c) Competition. (1) Under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts (except those recruited from the U.S.) are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:
            (i) Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances, and
            (ii) A justification supporting less than full and open competition must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.
            (2) PSCs with Untied States citizens or resident aliens recruited from outside the cooperating country. Solicitations for PSCs recruited outside the cooperating country must be publicized via the Agency's External Home Page on the Internet under the caption “Business & Procurement, USAID Procurements.” Instructions regarding how to access the External Internet and the information to be provided have been approved and included in a CIB. A justification under FAR 6.303 is not required when this procedure is followed.
            (3) A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement Executive to satisfy the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) for a justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. This class justification for Personal Services Contracts with U.S. Citizens may only be used for those who are recruited locally subject to the following conditions:
            (i) The position was publicized locally in accordance with established Mission policy or procedure, or the procedures in paragraph 5(c)(ii) was followed;
            (ii) As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs 5(c) (i) and (ii), at least 3 individuals were considered by consulting source lists (e.g., applications or resumes on hand) or conducting other informal solicitation.
            (iii) Extensions or renewals with the same individual for continuing services do not need to be publicized.
            (iv) A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant to (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this class justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is fair and reasonable.
            (4) If the appropriate competitive procedure in paragraph 5(3) is not followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate justification as required under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).

            (5) Since the award of a Personal Services Contract is based on technical qualifications, not price, and since the SF 171, “Personal Qualifications Statement”, and SF 171A, “Continuation Sheet for Standard Form 171”, are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR subparts 15.4 and 15.5 and FAR parts 52 and 53 are inappropriate and shall not be used. Instead, the solicitation and selection procedures outlined in this Appendix shall govern.
            
            6. Negotiating a Personal Services Contract. Negotiating a Personal Services Contract is significantly different from negotiating a nonpersonal services contract because it establishes an employer-employee relationship; therefore, the selection procedures are more akin to the personnel selection procedures.
            (a) Technical Officer's responsibilities. The Technical Officer shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications (i.e., SF 171s) received in response to the solicitation issued by the Contracting Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted with the applicants before the final selection is submitted to the Contracting Officer.
            (b) Contracting Officer's responsibilities. (1) The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of each SF 171 received under the solicitation to the Project Officer for evaluation.

            (2) On receipt of the Technical Officer's recommendation, the Contracting Officer shall conduct negotiations with the recommended applicant. Normally, the Contracting Officer shall negotiate only the salary (see the salary setting coverage in paragraph 4(e) of this Appendix). The terms and conditions of the contract, including differentials and allowances, are not negotiable or waivable without a properly approved deviation (see (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470). If the Contracting Officer can negotiate a salary that is fair and reasonable, then the award shall be made.
            (3) The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history on the SF 171 as the basis for salary negotiations, along with the market value of the position being recruited for (unless approval not to use market value has been granted under paragraph 4(e)(1)(ii)), and the Technical Officer's cost estimate.
            (4) The Contracting Officer will obtain two copies of IRS Form W-4, “Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate”, from the successful applicant. (Upon receipt, the Contracting Officer will forward one copy of the W-4 to the Office of the Controller.)

            (5) Security clearance is required for all U.S. citizens entering into USAID PSCs. The Contracting Officer will obtain four sets of SF 86, “Security Investigation Data for Sensitive Position”, from the successful applicant and forward them to the Office of Security. PSCs may receive a preliminary clearance and be placed under contract prior to receipt of clearance provided the appropriate paper work has been completed, reviewed by IG/SEC/PSI and acknowledged as a “no objection” to the appropriate Mission. See General Provision 24 in section 12 of this appendix.
            
            7. Executing a Personal Services Contract. Contracting Officers or Heads of Contracting Activities, whether USAID/W or Mission, may execute Personal Services Contracts, provided that the amount of the contract does not exceed the contracting authority that has been redelegated to them. In executing a Personal Services Contract, the Contracting Officer is responsible for insuring that:
            (a) The proposed contract is within his/her delegated authority;
            (b) A Request Number covering the proposed contract has been received;
            (c) The position has been classified by either the Mission or M/HR/POD (see CIB 96-8) and the classification is in the contract file;
            (d) The proposed Statement of Duties is contractible, contains a statement of minimum qualifications from the technical office requesting the services, and is suitable to the use of a Personal Services Contract in that:
            (1) Performance of the proposed work requires or is best suited for an employer-employee relationship, and is thus not suited to the use of a non-personal services contract;
            (2) The Statement of Duties does not require performance of any function normally reserved for Federal employees (see paragraph 4(b) of this Appendix); and
            (3) There is no apparent conflict of interest involved (if the Contracting Officer believes that a conflict of interest may exist, the question should be referred to the cognizant legal counsel);
            (e) Selection of the contractor is documented and justified. (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1) provides an exception to the requirement for full and open competition for Personal Services Contracts abroad (see paragraph 5(c) of this appendix);

            (f) The standard contract format prescribed for Personal Services Contracts (Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 to this appendix) is used; or that any necessary deviations are processed as required by (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470.
            
            (Note: The prescribed contract format is designed for use with contractors who are residing in the U.S. when hired. If the contract is with a U.S. citizen residing in the cooperating country when hired, contract provisions governing physical fitness and travel/transportation expenses, and home leave, allowances, and orientation should be suitably modified (see paragraph 4(d) of this appendix)).
            
            These modifications are not considered deviations subject to (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470. (Justification and explanation of these modifications is to be included in the contract file);
            (g) Orientation is arranged in accordance with General Provision 23 in section 12 of this appendix;
            (h) The contractor has submitted the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of at least two persons who may be notified in the event of an emergency (this information is to be retained in the contract file);
            (i) The contract is complete and correct and all information required on the contract Cover Page (USAID Form 1420-36A) has been entered;
            (j) The contract has been signed by the Contracting Office and the contractor, and fully executed copies are properly distributed;
            (k) The following clearances, approvals and forms have been obtained, properly completed, and placed in the contract file before the contract is signed by both parties;
            (1) Evidence of job classification in the file by the Mission except for grade equivalents above GS-13. For those positions with grade equivalent above GS-13, evidence of job classification done by M/HR/POD;
            (2) Security clearance, including the completed SF 86, to the extent required by USAID Handbook 6, Security or superseding ADS Chapter, (see General Provisions 14 and 24 in section 12 of this appendix);

            4. Workweek and Compensation (Pay Comparability Adjustments) (JUL 2007)

            (b) Compensation (Pay Comparability) Adjustments. The PSC's compensation shall be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems (usually in January). Any adjustments authorized are subject to the availability of funds and shall not exceed that percentage stated in the Executive Order granting the adjustment. Further, the adjusted compensation may not exceed the annual “USAID Contractor Salary Threshold (USAID CST)”, which is equivalent to the maximum rate for agencies without a certified SES performance appraisal system (or the equivalent hourly rate).
            5. Leave and Holidays (APR 1997)
            (a) Vacation Leave. (1) The contractor shall earn vacation leave at the rate of 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. However, no vacation shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 days.

            (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) above, if the contractor has had previous PSC service (i.e., has served under other personal services contracts (PSCs) covered by Sec. 636(a)(3) of the FAA), he/she shall earn vacation leave at the rate of either 6 hours every two weeks (10 hours for the final pay period of a calendar year) cumulative PSC service exceeding 3 years, or 8 hours every two weeks for cumulative PSC service exceeding 15 years.

            (3) It is understood that vacation leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the Cooperating Country. The Contractor in consultation with the USAID Mission shall develop a vacation leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. All vacation leave earned by the contractor must be used during his/her tour of duty. All vacation leave earned by the contractor but not taken by the end of his/her tour of duty will be forfeited unless the requirements of the activity precluded the employee from taking such leave and the Contracting Officer, with the endorsement of the Mission Director, approves one of the following as an alternative:
            (i) Taking leave during the concluding weeks of the employee's tour, or
            (ii) Lump-sum payment for leave not taken provided such leave does not exceed the number of days which can be earned by the employee during a twelve month period.
            (4) With the approval of the Mission Director, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be granted advance vacation leave in excess in that earned, but in no case shall a contractor be granted advance vacation leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse USAID for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.
            (b) Sick Leave. Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 work-days per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract for the same or similar services at the same Mission, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. No leave my be carried over from one post to another.
            (c) Home Leave. (1) Home leave is leave earned for service abroad for use only in the United States, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or in the possessions of the United States.

Home leave must be taken in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the United States, and any days spent elsewhere will be charged to vacation leave or leave without pay.
            (3) Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph (c)(2) above that the contractor must have served 2 years overseas under personal services contract with this Mission to be eligible for home leave, the contractor may be granted advance home leave subject to all of the following conditions:
            (i) Granting of leave home leave would in each case serve to advance the attainment of the objectives of this contract;
            (ii) The contractor has served a minimum of 18 months in the Cooperating Country on his/her current tour of duty under this contract; and
            (iii) The contractor agrees to return to the Cooperating Country to serve out the remainder of his/her current tour of duty and an additional 2 year appointment under this or subsequent contract, or such other additional appointment of not less than 1 year of overseas service as the Mission Director may approve.
            (4) The period of service overseas required under paragraph (c)(2), or paragraph (c)(3) above, shall include the actual days in orientation in the United States (less language training) and the actual days overseas beginning on the date of departure from the U.S. port of embarkation on international travel and continuing, inclusive of authorized delays enroute, to the date of arrival at the U.S. port of debarkation from international travel. Allowable vacation and sick leave taken while overseas, but not leave without pay, shall be included in the required period of service overseas. An amount equal to the number of days of vacation and sick leave taken in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the United States will be added to the required period of service overseas.

            (5) Salary during the travel to and from the United States for home leave will be limited to the time required for travel by the most expeditious air route. The contractor will be responsible for reimbursing USAID for payments made during home leave, if, in spite of the undertaking of the new appointment, the contractor, except for reasons beyond his/her control as determined by the Contracting Officer, does not return overseas and complete the additional required service. Unused home leave is not reimbursable under this contract.
            
            (6) To the extent deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, a contractor in the United States on home leave may be authorized to spend not more than 5 days in work status for consultation at USAID/Washington before returning to post duty.

            (f) Leave Without Pay. Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the Contracting Officer or Mission Director.
            (g) Compensatory Time. Compensatory leave may be granted only with the written approval of the Contracting Officer or Mission Director in rare instances when it has been determined absolutely essential and used under those guidelines which apply to direct-hire employees.
            (h) Leave Records. The contractor shall maintain current leave records for himself/herself and make them available, as requested by the Mission Director or the Contracting Officer.

            (1) Post differential. Post differential is an additional compensation for service at places in foreign areas where conditions of environment differ substantially from conditions of environment in the continental United States and warrant additional compensation as a recruitment and retention incentive. In areas where post differential is paid to USAID direct-hire employees, post differential not to exceed the percentage of salary as is provided such USAID employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) Chapter 500 (except the limitation contained in Section 552, “Ceiling on Payment”) Tables—Chapter 900, as from time to time amended, will be reimbursable hereunder for employees in respect to amounts earned during the time such employees actually spend overseas on work under this contract. When such post differential is provided to the contractor, it shall be payable beginning on the date of arrival at the post of assignment and continue, including periods away from post on official business, until the close of business on the day of departure from post of assignment enroute to the United States.

Post differential will not be payable while the employee is away from his/her post of assignment for purposes of home leave. Short-term employees shall be entitled to pose differential beginning with the forty-third (43rd) day at post.
            (2) Living quarters allowance. Living quarters allowance is an allowance granted to reimburse an employee for substantially all of his/her cost for either temporary or residence quarters whenever Government-owned or Government-rented quarters are not provided to him/her at his/her post without charge. Such costs are those incurred for temporary lodging (temporary lodging allowance) or one unit of residence quarters (living quarters allowance) and include rent, plus any costs not included therein for heat, light, fuel, gas, electricity and water. The temporary lodging allowance and the living quarters allowance are never both payable to an employee for the same period of time. The contractor will receive living quarters allowance for payment of rent and utilities if such facilities are not supplied. Such allowance shall not exceed the amount paid USAID employees of equivalent rank in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with either the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 130, as from time to time amended, or other rates approved by the Mission Director. Subject to the written approval of the Mission Director, short-term employees may be paid per diem (in lieu of living quarters allowance) at rates prescribed by the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, during the time such short-term employees spend at posts of duty in the Cooperating Country under this contract. In authorizing such per diem rates, the Mission Director shall consider the particular circumstances involved with respect to each such short-term employee including the extent to which meals and/or lodging may be made available without charge or at nominal cost by an agency of the United States Government or of the Cooperating Government, and similar factors.
            (3) Temporary lodging allowance. Temporary lodging allowance is a quarters allowance granted to an employee for the reasonable cost of temporary quarters incurred by the employee and his/her family for a period not in excess of (i) three months after first arrival at a new post in a foreign area or a period ending with the occupation of residence (permanent) quarters, if earlier, and (ii) one month immediately preceding final departure from the post subsequent to the necessary vacating of residence quarters. The contractor will receive temporary lodging allowance for himself/herself and authorized dependents, in lieu of living quarters allowance, not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 120, as from time to time amended.
            (4) Post allowance. Post allowance is a cost-of-living allowance granted to an employee officially stationed at a post where the cost of living, exclusive of quarters cost, is substantially higher than in Washington, DC. The contractor will receive post allowance payments not to exceed those paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 220, as from time to time amended.
            (5) Supplemental post allowance. Supplemental post allowance is a form of post allowance granted to an employee at his/her post when it is determined that assistance is necessary to defray extraordinary subsistence costs. The contractor will receive supplemental post allowance payments not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 230, as from time to time amended.
            (6) Payments during evacuation. The Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) provide the authority for efficient, orderly, and equitable procedure for the payment of compensation, post differential and allowances in the event of an emergency evacuation of employees or their dependents, or both, from duty stations for military or other reasons or because of imminent danger to their lives. If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission Director, the contractor will receive payments during evacuation for himself/herself and authorized dependents evacuated from their post of assignment in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended.
            (7) Educational allowance. Educational allowance is an allowance to assist the contractor in meeting the extraordinary and necessary expenses, not otherwise compensated for, incurred by reason of his/her service in a foreign area in providing adequate elementary and secondary education for his/her children. The contractor will receive educational allowance payments for his/her dependent children in amounts not to exceed those set forth in Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 270, as from time to time amended.
            (8) Separate maintenance allowance. Separate maintenance allowance is an allowance to assist an employee who is compelled by reason of dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions at his/her post of assignment in a foreign area, or for the convenience of the Government, to meet the additional expense of maintaining his/her dependents elsewhere than at such post. The contractor will receive separate maintenance allowance payments not to exceed that made to USAID employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 260, as from time to time amended.
            (9) Danger pay allowance. Danger pay allowance is an allowance to provide additional compensation above basic compensation to employees in foreign areas where civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism or wartime conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. The danger pay allowance is in lieu of that part of the post differential which is attributable to political violence. Consequently, the post differential may be reduced while danger pay is in effect to avoid dual crediting for political violence. The contractor shall be allowed danger pay allowance not to exceed that paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 650, as from time to time amended.
            (10) Educational travel. Educational travel is travel to and from a school in the United States for secondary education (in lieu of an educational allowance) and for college education. The contractor will receive educational travel payments for his/her dependent children provided such payment does not exceed that which would be payable in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 280, as from time to time amended. Educational travel shall not be authorized for contractors whose assignment is less than two years.
            (b) The allowances provided in paragraphs (a) (1) through (10) of this provision shall be paid to the contractor in dollars or in the currency of the Cooperating Country in accordance with practice prevailing at the Mission, or the Mission Director may direct that the contractor be paid a per diem in lieu thereof as prescribed by the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), as from time to time amended.
            7. Social Security, Federal Income Tax, and Foreign Earned Income (June 1990)
            (a) Since the contractor is an employee, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.
            (b) As an employee, the contractor is not eligible for the “foreign earned income” exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).
            8. Advance of Dollar Funds (APR 1997)
            If requested by the contractor and authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, USAID will arrange for an advance of funds to defray the initial cost of travel, travel allowances, authorized precontract expenses, and shipment of personal property. The advance shall be granted on the same basis as to a USAID U.S.-citizen direct-hire employee in accordance with USAID Handbook 22, Chapter 4 or superseding ADS Chapter.
            9. Insurance (APR 1997)
            (a) Worker's compensation benefits. The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.
            (b) Health and life insurance. (1) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 50% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.
            (2) The contractor shall be provided a contribution of up to 50% against the actual costs of annual life insurance not to exceed $500.00 per year.
            (3) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such case, the contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b) (1) or (2) as appropriate.
            (4) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.
            (5) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this provision.
            (c) Insurance on private automobiles. If the contractor or his/her dependents transport, or cause to be transported, privately owned automobile(s) to the Cooperating Country, or any of them purchase an automobile within the Cooperating Country, the contractor agrees to ensure that all such automobile(s) during such ownership within the Cooperating Country will be covered by a current, i.e., not in arrears, insurance policy issued by a reliable company providing the following minimum coverage, or such other minimum coverage as may be set by the Mission Director, payable in U.S. dollars or its equivalent in the currency of the Cooperating Country: injury to persons, $10,000/$20,000; property damage, $5,000. The contractor further agrees to deliver, or cause to be delivered to the Mission Director, the insurance policies required by this clause or satisfactory proof of the existence thereof, before such automobile(s) operated within the Cooperating Country. The premium costs for such insurance shall not be a reimbursable cost under this contract.
            
            10. Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993)
            (a) General. (1) USAID/Washington Office of Administrative Services, or such other office as may be designated by that office, may furnish Transportation Requests (TR's) to the contractor for transportation authorized by this contract originating in the United States, and the executive or administrative officer at the Mission may furnish TR's for such authorized transportation which is payable in local currency or is to originate overseas. When transportation is not provided by the Government-issued TR, the contractor shall procure his/her own transportation, the costs of which will be reimbursed in accordance with the terms of this contract.
            (2) The contractor will be reimbursed for reasonable, allocable and allowable travel and transportation expenses incurred under and for the performance of this contract. Determination of reasonableness, allocability and allowability will be made by the Contracting Officer in accordance with USAID's established policies and procedures for USAID direct-hire employees, and the particular needs of the activity being implemented by this contract. The following paragraphs provide specific guidance and limitations on particular items of cost.
            (b) U.S. travel and transportation. The contractor shall be reimbursed for actual transportation costs and travel allowances in the United States as authorized in the Contract Schedule or approved in advance by the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director. Transportation costs and travel allowances shall not be reimbursed in any amount greater than the cost of, and time required for, economy-class commercially scheduled air travel by the most expeditious route except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this provision unless economy air travel is not available and the contractor certifies to this in his/her voucher or other documents submitted for reimbursement.
            (c) International travel. For travel to and from post of assignment, the contractor shall be reimbursed for travel costs and travel allowances from place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of the travel from the contractor's residence in the United States) to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of travel from the post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the contractor's residence) upon completion of services by the individual. Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with USAID's established policies and procedures for its direct-hire employees and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. If the contract is for longer than one year and the contractor does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs of going to and from the post of duty for the contractor and his/her dependents are not reimbursable hereunder. If the contractor serves more than one year but less than the required service in the Cooperating Country (except for reasons beyond his/her control) the costs of going to the post of duty are reimbursable hereunder but the costs of going from post of duty to the contractor's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract, or other location as approved by the Contracting Officer, are not reimbursable under this contract for the contractor and his/her dependents. When travel is by economy class accommodations, the contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of transporting up to 10 kilograms/22 pounds of accompanied personal baggage per traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the economy ticket provided that the total number of pounds of baggage does not exceed that regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel allowances for travelers shall not be in excess of the rates authorized in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas)-hereinafter referred to as the Standardized Regulations—as from time to time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover enroute for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations as from time to time amended.
            (d) Local travel. Reimbursement for local travel in connection with duties directly referable to the contract shall not be in excess of the rates established by the Mission Director for the travel costs of travelers in the Cooperating Country. In the absence of such established rates the contractor shall be reimbursed for actual travel costs in the Cooperating Country or the Mission, including travel allowances at rates not in excess of those prescribed by the Standardized Regulations.
            (e) Indirect travel for personal convenience. When travel is performed by an indirect route for the personal convenience of the traveler, the allowable costs of such travel will be computed on the basis of the cost of allowable air fare via the direct usually traveled route. If such costs include fares for air or ocean travel by foreign flag carriers, approval for indirect travel by such foreign flag carriers must be obtained from the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director before such travel is undertaken, otherwise only that portion of travel accomplished by the United States-flag carriers will be reimbursable within the above limitation of allowable costs.
            (f) Limitation on travel by dependents. Travel costs and allowances will be allowed for authorized dependents of the contractor and such costs shall be reimbursed for travel from place of abode to assigned station in the Cooperating Country and returned, only if the dependent remains in the Cooperating Country for at least 9 months or one-half of the required tour of duty of the contractor, whichever is greater, except as otherwise authorized hereunder for education, medical or emergency visitation travel. If the dependent is eligible for educational travel pursuant to the “Differential and Allowances” clause of this contract, time spent away from post resulting from educational travel will be counted as time at post.
            (g) Delays enroute. The contractor may be granted reasonable delays enroute while in travel status when such delays are caused by events beyond the control of the contractor and are not due to circuitous routine. It is understood that if delay is caused by physical incapacitation, he/she shall be eligible for such sick leave as provided under the “Leave and Holidays” clause of this contract.
            (h) Travel by Privately Owned Automobile (POV). If travel by POV is authorized in the contract schedule or approved by the Contracting Officer, the contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of travel performed in his/her POV at a rate not to exceed that authorized in the Federal Travel Regulations plus authorized per diem for the employee and for each of the authorized dependents traveling in the POV, if the POV is being driven to or from the Cooperating Country as authorized under the contract, provided that the total cost of the mileage and the per diem paid to all authorized travelers shall not exceed the total constructive cost of fare and normal per diem by all authorized travelers by surface common carrier or authorized air fare, whichever is less.
            (i) Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation. Emergency transportation costs and travel allowances while enroute, as provided in this section, will be reimbursed not to exceed amounts authorized by the Foreign Service Travel Regulations for USAID-direct hire employees in like circumstances under the following conditions:
            (1) The costs of going from post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other location for contractor employees and dependents and returning to the post of duty, subject to the prior written approval of the Mission Director that such travel is necessary for one of the following reasons.
            (i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned, or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. The Mission Director may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contract expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.
            (ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.
            (2) When, for any reason, the Mission Director determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed for travel and transportation expenses and travel allowance while enroute, for the cost of the individuals going from post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract or other approved location. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the Mission Director when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so.
            (3) The Mission Director may also authorize emergency or irregular travel and transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. The authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.
            (j) Home Leave Travel. To the extend that home leave has been authorized as provided in the “Leave and Holidays” clause of this contract, the cost of travel for home leave is reimbursable for travel costs and travel allowances of travelers from the post of duty in the Cooperating Country to place of residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of travel to the contractor's residence in the United States) and return to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country. Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with the Uniform State/USAID/USIA Foreign Service Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. Travel allowances for travelers shall be in accordance with the rates authorized in the Standardized Regulations as from time to time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route using economy class. One stopover enroute for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler or the traveler uses other than economy class. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with the Standardized Regulations.
            (k) Rest and Recuperations Travel. If approved in writing by the Mission Director, the contractor and his/her dependents shall be allowed rest and recuperation travel on the same basis as authorized USAID direct-hire Mission employees and their dependents.
            (l) Transportation of Motor Vehicles, Personal Effects and Household Goods. (1) Transportation costs will be paid on the same basis as for USAID direct-hire employees serving the same length tour of duty, as authorized in the schedule. Transportation, including packing and crating costs, will be paid for shipping from the point of origin in the United States (or other location as approved by the Contracting Officer) to post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to point of origin in the United States (or other location as approved by the Contracting Officer) of one privately-owned vehicle for the contractor, personal effects of the contractor and authorized dependents, and household goods of the contractor not to exceed the limitations in effect for such shipments for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations in effect at the time shipment is made. These limitations may be obtained from the Contracting Officer.
            (2) The cost of transporting motor vehicles and household goods shall not exceed the cost of packing, crating, and transportation by surface common carrier. In the event that the carrier does not require boxing or crating of motor vehicles for shipment to the Cooperating Country, the cost of boxing or crating is not reimbursable. The transportation of a privately owned motor vehicle for a contractor may be authorized as a replacement of the last such motor vehicle shipped under this contract for such contractor when the Mission Director determines, in advance, and so notifies the contractor in writing, that the replacement is necessary for reasons not due to the negligence or malfeasance of the contractor. The determination shall be made under the same rules and regulations that apply to authorized Mission U.S. citizen direct-hire employees.
            (m) Unaccompanied Baggage. Unaccompanied baggage is considered to be those personal belongings needed by the traveler immediately upon arrival of the contractor and dependents, and consideration should be given to advance shipments of unaccompanied baggage. The contractor will be reimbursed for costs of shipment of unaccompanied baggage (in addition to the weight allowance for household effects) not to exceed the limitations in effect for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect when shipment is made. These limitations are available from the Contracting Officer. This unaccompanied baggage may be shipped as air freight by the most direct route between authorized points of origin and destination regardless of the modes of travel used. This provision is applicable to home leave travel when authorized by the terms of this contract.
            (n) International Ocean Transportation—(1)(i) Transportation of things. Where U.S. flag vessels are not available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the contractor may obtain a release from the requirement to use U.S. flag vessels from the Transportation Division, Office of Acquisition and Assistance, U.S. Agency for International Development, Washington, D.C. 20523-1419, or the Mission Director, as appropriate, giving the basis for the request.
            (ii) Transportation of persons. Where U.S. flag vessels are not available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the contractor may obtain a release from the requirement to use U.S. flag vessels from the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director, as appropriate.
            (2) Transportation of foreign-made vehicles. Reimbursement of the costs of transporting a foreign-made motor vehicle will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Service Travel Regulations.
            (3) Reduced rates on U.S.-flag carriers are in effect for shipments of household goods and personal effects of USAID contractors between certain locations. These reduced rates are available provided the shipper furnishes to the carrier at the time of the issuance of the Bill of Lading documentary evidence that the shipment is for the account of USAID. The Contracting Officer will, on request, furnish to the contractor current information concerning the availability of a reduced rate with respect to any proposed shipment. The contractor will not be reimbursed for shipments of household goods or personal effects in amounts in excess of the reduced rates which are available in accordance with the foregoing.
            (o) Storage of household effects. The cost of storage charges (including packing, crating, and drayage costs) in the U.S. of household goods of the contractor will be permitted in lieu of transportation of all or any part of such goods to the Cooperating Country under paragraph (l) above provided that the total amount of effects shipped to the Cooperating Country or stored in the U.S. shall not exceed the amount authorized for USAID direct-hire employees under the Uniform Foreign Service Travel Regulations. These amounts are available from the Contracting Officer.
            
            11. Payment (AUG 1996)
            (a) Once each month, or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the paying office indicated on the Cover Page, the contractor may submit to such office form SF 1034 “Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal” (original) and SF 1034-A (three copies), or whatever other form is locally required or accepted. Each voucher shall be identified by the USAID contract number and properly executed in the amount of dollars claimed during the period covered. The voucher forms shall be supported by:
            (1) The contractor's detailed invoice, in original and two copies, indicating for each amount claimed the paragraph of the contract under which payment is to be made, supported when applicable as follows:
            (i) For compensation—a statement showing period covered, days worked, and days when contractor was in authorized travel, leave, or stopover status for which compensation is claimed. All claims for compensation will be accompanied by, or will incorporate, a certification signed by the Project Officer covering days or hours worked, or authorized travel or leave time for which compensation is claimed.
            (ii) For travel and transportation—a statement of itinerary with attached carrier's receipt and/or passenger's coupons, as appropriate.
            (iii) For reimbursable expenses—an itemized statement supported by original receipts.
            (2) The first voucher submitted shall account for, and liquidate the unexpended balance of any funds advanced to the contractor.
            (b) A final voucher shall be submitted by the contractor promptly following completion of the duties under this contract but in no event later than 120 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may in his/her discretion approve in writing) from the date of such completion. The contractor's claim, which includes his/her final settlement of compensation, shall not be paid until after the performance of the duties required under the terms of this contract has been approved by USAID. On receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the contractor as the “final voucher” submitted on Form SF 1034 (original) and SF 1034-A (three copies), together with a refund check for the balance remaining on hand of any funds which may have been advanced to the contractor, the Government shall pay any amounts due and owing the contractor.
            (c) If approved by the paying office time and attendance may be submitted for PSCs in the same manner as is approved for direct-hire personnel.
            12. Conversion of U.S. Dollars to Local Currency (DEC 1985)
            Upon arrival in the Cooperating Country, and from time to time as appropriate, the contractor shall consult with the Mission Director or his/her authorized representative who shall provide, in writing, the policy the contractor shall follow in the conversion of U.S. dollars to local currency. This may include, but not be limited to the conversion of said currency through the cognizant U.S. Disbursing Officer, or Mission Controller, as appropriate.
            13. Post of Assignment Privileges (JUL 1993)
            Privileges such as the use of APO, PX's, commissaries and officers clubs are established at posts abroad under agreements between the U.S. and host governments. These facilities are intended for and usually limited to members of the official U.S. establishment including the Embassy, USAID Mission, U.S. Information Service and the Military. Normally, the agreements do not permit these facilities to be made available to non-official Americans. However, in those cases where facilities are open to non-official Americans, they may be used.
            14. Security Requirements (June 1990)
            (a) This entire provision shall apply to the extent that this contract involves access to classified information (“Confidential”, “Secret”, or “Top Secret”) or access to administratively controlled information (“Limited Official Use”).

            (c) The contractor shall follow the procedures for classifying, marking, handling, transmitting, disseminating, storing, and destroying official material in accordance with the regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Chapter 5 (5 FAM 900), a copy of which will be furnished by the Contracting Officer or Mission Director.

            (e) The Government agrees that, when necessary, it shall indicate by security classification or administratively controlled designation, the degree of importance to the national defense of information to be furnished by the contractor to the Government or by the Government to the contractor, and the Government shall give written notice of such security classification or administratively controlled designation to the contractor and of any subsequent changes thereof. The contractor is authorized to rely on any letter or other written instrument signed by the Contracting Officer changing a security classification or administratively controlled designation of information.
            (f) The contractor agrees to certify after completion of his/her assignment under this contract that he/she has surrendered or disposed of all classified and/or administratively controlled information in his/her custody in accordance with applicable security instructions.

            (b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.
            (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be terminated under General Provision 16 of this contract. The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.
            (d) The Mission Director is the chief representative of USAID in the Cooperating Country. In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total USAID Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising USAID regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program. The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Mission Director, and shall keep the Mission Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.
            16. Termination (NOV 1989)
            (This is an approved deviation to be used in place of the clause specified in FAR 52.249-12.)
            (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this contract in whole or, from time to time, in part:
            (1) For cause, which may be effected immediately after establishing the facts warranting the termination, by giving written notice and a statement of reasons to the contractor in the event (i) the Contractor commits a breach or violation of any obligations herein contained, (ii) a fraud was committed in obtaining this contract, or (iii) the contractor is guilty (as determined by USAID) of misconduct in the Cooperating Country. Upon such a termination, the contractor's right to compensation shall cease when the period specified in such notice expires or the last day on which the contractor performs services hereunder, whichever is earlier. No costs of any kind incurred by the contractor after the date such notice is delivered shall be reimbursed hereunder except the cost of return transportation (not including travel allowances), if approved by the Contracting Officer. If any costs relating to the period subsequent to such date have been paid by USAID, the contractor shall promptly refund to USAID any such prepayment as directed by the Contracting Officer.
            (2) For the convenience of USAID, by giving not less than 15 calendar days advance written notice to the contractor. Upon such a termination, contractor's right to compensation shall cease when the period specified in such notice expires except that the contractor shall be entitled to any unused vacation leave, return transportation costs and travel allowances and transportation of unaccompanied baggage costs at the rate specified in the contract and subject to the limitations which apply to authorized travel status.

            (3) For the convenience of USAID, when the contractor is unable to complete performance of his/her services under the contract by reason of sickness or physical or emotional incapacity based upon a certification of such circumstances by a duly qualified doctor of medicine approved by the Mission. The contract shall be deemed terminated upon delivery to the Contractor of a termination notice. Upon such a termination, the contractor shall not be entitled to compensation except to the extent of any unused vacation or sick leave but shall be entitled to return transportation, travel allowances, and unaccompanied baggage costs at rates specified in the contract and subject to the limitations which apply to authorized travel status.
            (b) The contractor, with the written consent of the Contracting Officer, may terminate this contract upon at least 15 days' written notice to the Contracting Officer.
            17. Release of Information (DEC 1985)
            All rights in data and reports shall become the property of the U.S. Government.

            (name of the cognizant Contracting Officer with a copy to the appropriate Mission Director).
            To Contractor:
            At his/her post of duty while in the Cooperating Country and at the Contractor's address shown on the Cover Page of this contract or to such other address as either of such parties shall designate by notice given as herein required.

            20. Use of Pouch Facilities (July 1993)
            (a) Use of diplomatic pouch is controlled by the Department of State. The Department of State has authorized the use of pouch facilities for USAID contractors and their employees as a general policy, as detailed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this provision. However, the final decision regarding use of pouch facilities rests with the Embassy or USAID Mission. In consideration of the use of pouch facilities as hereinafter stated, the Contractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Department of State and USAID for loss or damage occurring in pouch transmission.
            (1) Contractors are authorized use of the pouch for transmission and receipt of up to a maximum of 0.90 kilogram/2 pounds per shipment of correspondence and documents needed in the administration of foreign assistance programs.
            (2) U.S. citizen contractors are authorized use of the pouch for personal mail up to a maximum of 0.45 kilogram/one pound per shipment (but see (a)(3) below). Non-U.S. citizen Contractors are not permitted use of the pouch for personal mail except to the extent that such use may be authorized by the Chief of Mission.
            (3) Merchandise, parcels, magazines, or newspapers are not considered to be personal mail for purpose of this clause, and are not authorized to be sent or received by pouch.
            (4) Official and personal mail under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this provision, sent by pouch, should be addressed as follows:
            Individual's Name (C), U.S. Agency for International Development, Washington, D.C. 20523-0001.
            (5) Mail sent via the diplomatic pouch may not be in violation of U.S. Postal laws and may not contain material ineligible for pouch transmission.
            (6) Use of military postal facilities (APO/FPO) is authorized to U.S. contractors on the same basis as approved for direct-hire employees at the USAID Mission. Posts having access to APO/FPO facilities and using such for diplomatic pouch dispatch, may, however, accept official and personal mail for the pouch provided, of course, adequate postage is affixed when onward transmission (mail to other than USAID/W) through U.S. postal channels is required.
            (b) The contractor shall be responsible for compliance with these guidelines and limitations on use of pouch facilities.

            (c) Specific additional guidance on use of pouch facilities in accordance with this clause is available from the Post Communication Center at the Embassy or USAID Mission.
            21. Biographical Data (June 1990)

            (1) Contractor's full name, home address, and telephone number including any after-hours emergency number(s).
            (2) The name and number of the contract, and whether the individual is the contractor or the contractor's dependent.
            (3) The name, address, and home and office telephone number(s) of each individual's next of kin.
            (4) Any special instructions pertaining to emergency situations such as power of attorney designees or alternate contact persons.
            22. U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractor (June 1990)
            A contractor meeting the definition of a U.S. Resident Hire PSC contained in Section 12, General Provisions, Clause 1, Definitions, shall be subject to U.S. Federal Income Tax, but shall not be eligible for any fringe benefits (except contributions for FICA, health insurance and life insurance), allowances, or differentials, including but not limited to travel and transportation, medical, orientation, home leave, etc., unless such individual can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that he/she has received similar benefits/allowances from their immediately previous employer in the Cooperating Country, or the Mission Director determines that payment of such benefits would be consistent with the Mission's policy and practice and would be in the best interest of the U.S. Government.
            23. Orientation and Language Training (July 1993)
            (a) Except as set forth in paragraph (b)(4) below, the Contractor shall receive a maximum of 2 weeks USAID orientation before travel overseas. The dates of orientation shall be selected by the Contractor and approved by the Contracting Officer from the orientation schedule provided by USAID.
            (b) As either set forth in the Contract Schedule, or provided in writing by the Contracting Officer, the following may be authorized taking into consideration specific job requirements, contractor's prior overseas experience, or unusual circumstances, in connection with orientation of individual Contractors:
            (1) Modified orientation,
            (2) Language training,
            (3) Orientation for Contractor's dependents at contract expense.
            (4) Waiver of orientation for individual contractor.
            (c) Transportation costs and travel allowances not to exceed one round trip from the Contractor's residence to place of orientation and return will be reimbursed, pursuant to Clause 10 of the General Provisions, entitled “Travel and Transportation Expenses,” if the orientation is more than 80 kilometers/50 miles from the contractor's residence.
            Allowable salary costs during the period of orientation are also reimbursable.
            24. Conditions for Contracting Prior to Receipt of Security Clearance (July 1993)
            (a) U.S. Resident Hire PSC. The contractor may commence work prior to the completion of the security clearance. However, until such time as clearance is received, the contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. Further, failure to obtain clearance will constitute cause for contract termination in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of General Provision 16 of this contract.
            (b) U.S. PSC—Non-Resident Hire. The contractor may elect to commence travel to post immediately to begin work prior to completion of the security clearance. However, until such time as security clearance is received, the contractor shall:
            (1) Have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials;
            (2) Be authorized to travel to post himself/herself only; and

            (3) Be authorized no entitlements other than those normally authorized for short term (less than a year) employees at post. Even if the contract is for one year or more, dependents may not accompany contractor unless at his/her expense, and transportation/storage of household/personal effects and motor vehicle will not be financed by USAID prior to the receipt of the security clearance. Upon receipt of clearance, the Contracting Officer will authorize reimbursement of any such costs borne at contractor's expense prior to clearance provided they are reasonable, allocable and allowable. If appropriate given the length of time remaining, the Contracting Officer will authorize dependent travel and shipment/storage of motor vehicle and effects. Allowances which would not be provided to short term employees will be authorized after clearance is received provided that the contractor is otherwise entitled to such benefits. Failure to obtain the security clearance will constitute cause for contract termination in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of General Provision 16 of this contract.
            
            25. Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) Services (JUL 2007)
            (a) The PSC must obtain MEDEVAC service coverage including coverage for authorized dependents while performing personal services abroad.
            USAID will reimburse the total cost of MEDEVAC insurance to the PSC. The PSC must provide proof of coverage to the CO in order to receive reimbursement.
            (b) Exceptions. (1) A PSC and authorized dependents with a health insurance program that includes sufficient MEDEVAC coverage as approved by the Contracting Officer are not required to obtain MEDEVAC service coverage.
            (2) The Mission Director at the post of assignment may make a written determination to waive the requirement for such coverage. The determination must be based on findings that the quality of local medical services or other circumstances obviate the need for such coverage for PSCs and their dependents located at post.
            26. Governing Law (NOV 1996)

            This contract is established under the procurement authorities of the United States Government and shall be interpreted in accordance with the body of Federal Procurement Law in the United States.

            Appendix F to Chapter 7—Use of Collaborative Assistance Method for Title XII Activities
            1. Introduction
            This appendix provides a detailed description of the collaborative assistance method of contracting. This is a specialized contracting system which may be used for contracting with educational institutions eligible under, and for activities authorized under, Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, under the circumstances described in AIDAR 715.613-71.
            2. Purpose
            The collaborative assistance system is designed to:
            (a) Increase the joint implementation authority and responsibility of the contractor and the LDC;
            (b) Encourage more effective collaboration between all participating parties (USAID, host country, and contractor) at important stages, including the design stage of a technical assistance project.
            3. Policy

            The collaborative assistance approach represents an alternative method for long-term technical assistance which involves professional collaboration with eligible Title XII institutions and LDC counterparts for a problem-solving type activity to develop new institutional forms and capabilities, to devise operating systems and policies, and to conduct joint research and development—including training. In such an activity, the difficulty in defining, in advance, precise and objectively verifiable contractor inputs and long-term project content as a basis for payment usually requires a flexible approach to project design, contracting, and project implementation. Such flexibility is also essential to the collaborative style which is responsive to LDC desires in problem areas of great complexity and varying uncertainty. Other types of technical assistance, which are usually shorter in term are amenable to more precise definition in advance, or involve closely defined and relatively standardized services, or are otherwise more analogous to commodity resource transfers, may be suitable for other contracting methods, e.g., certain forms of institution building, on-the-job training, resource surveys, etc. The collaborative assistance method is an approved method for providing technical assistance when used in accordance with the circumstances outlined above, and with the guidelines set forth in paragraph 4, below.
            4. Implementation Procedures
            (a) Introduction. This paragraph 4, provides background information, guidelines and procedures to effect the implementation of the policy set forth in paragraph 3 of this appendix.
            (b) Conditions and practices. In order for this policy to work effectively even when the proposed activity fits the criteria described under Policy, there must also be:
            (1) Acceptance of the notion that the host country, in consultation with the contractor, is in the best position to make tactical, day-to-day decisions on project inputs within agreed-upon limitations and output expectations;
            (2) Sufficient trust and respect between the Agency and the contractor to allow this flexible implementation authority;
            (3) A direct-hire project monitor with appropriate background to be knowledgeable of progress and to assist in an advisory and facilitative capacity, both during and between periodic reviews. In addition, the following important conditions must be met:
            (i) Adequate preproject communication between, and identification of assistance required by, the host government and USAID;
            (ii) Full joint planning and improved project design (“Joint” as used herein refers to the primary parties, i.e., the collaborating institutions, as well as the host government and USAID. In some instances, it can also include other donors.);
            (iii) Careful contractor selection, i.e., matching of the contractor's technical and managerial capabilities to the anticipated requirements of the overseas activity;
            (iv) Establishment of relationships between host country, USAID and contractor staff to include host country leadership, flexible implementation authority, and effective management by the contractor;
            (v) Improved joint project evaluation, feedback, and replanning; and
            (vi) Simplified administrative procedures and greater reliance on in-country logistical support.
            (c) Project Stages and Contractor Involvement. In the long-term technical assistance projects as described above, there are four discrete but sometimes overlapping decision stages which take place—with the principal contractor usually involved in the last three.
            (1) Problem analysis and project identification. After the host government has indicated a desire for U.S. collaboration on a particular problem and the USAID field mission has determined that the proposed activity is consistent with its program goals and priorities, considerable effort is usually necessary to refine further the project purpose and type of assistance required and provide a basis for contractor selection. This is a crucial step and is focused on results sought—on what the prospective contractor is expected to produce in relation to resources to be used and to project purpose. It should result in a clear understanding of what the LDC wants, and an overall plan which includes agreement on specific objectives or outputs, acceptable types of activities and inputs and an initial budget—resulting in project documentation. At this step, USAID makes decisions it cannot delegate on what it will support and at what cost. If needed to supplement its direct-hire expertise, USAID can use outside consultants for analysis and advice but retains the ultimate decision for itself in collaboration with, but independent of, the requesting host government. (Normally, the proposed contractor for project definition and subsequent implementation should not have been involved in the problem analysis and project identification stage as a consultant to either the host country government, host institution, or USAID. If a potential contractor has been so involved, particular care must be taken to prevent actual or apparent organizational conflicts of interest in the procurement that follows. This could require at a minimum, a careful assessment and complete documentation of reasons for selection.)
            Normally, there will need to be some mutual interaction between the overall planning stage outlined here and the detailed planning and design work which follows in the next phase. There will usually be some overlap, with preliminary decisions in this stage providing a basis for selection of implementing agents for stage (2) which in turn proceeds through some preliminary planning to guide completion of stage (1) as a basis for long-term contracting.
            (2) Project definition. At this stage, having selected the implementing agent, the U.S. and LDC organizations which will be collaborating in carrying out the project are encouraged to work out, to their mutual 3/8satisfaction, the particulars of what to do and how to do it (i.e., detailed project design) within the context of LDC leadership and responsibility and the general agreements and budget reached in stage (1). The emphasis here is on the technical approach to be utilized and the scheduling and management of project inputs. This may involve a short-term reconnaissance and/or an extensive period of detailed joint planning and feeling out of what is feasible during a preliminary operating phase of the project, possibly lasting as much as a year or more. This stage recognizes the importance, for the problem-solving or ground breaking types of technical assistance, of involving the U.S. and LDC implementing organizations together as soon as the detailed design work begins. USAID's role here is to facilitate, not direct, the joint planning, assure consistency with prior agreements or concur in changes, affirm that the implementing parties have agreed on a reasonable project design, and prepare or cause to be prepared the documentation required for stage (3), including any amendments that might be required to the project documentation. If and when a decision is made by the host government and USAID to proceed into the operating phase with the same contractor, the U.S. intermediary should be treated as a cooperating partner in the negotiation of the subsequent long-term operating agreement(s) with the host government, host institution and USAID.
            (3) Implementation. The results of the approach outlined in the stage above should include, in addition to a better understanding and more meaningful commitment by all parties, the following specific products:
            (i) A jointly developed life-of-project design which reflects the commitment of all parties and includes clear statements of purpose, principal outputs, eligible types of activity and expenditure limits, critical assumptions, and major progress indicators;
            (ii) A workplan and input schedule for the first two years or at least as long as the expenditure period for the next obligation of project funds;
            (iii) Provisions for any administrative support, special services or other inputs by the host country, contractor, and/or USAID; and
            (iv) A plan for periodic joint evaluation and review or progress and subsequent workplans, normally annually, with the participation of all parties.
            Appropriate elements of these agreements and understandings are now embodied in a contract for project implementation, as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of the section on Contracting Implications. This contract allows the U.S. intermediary to apply its judgment, reflecting close collaboration with its LDC colleagues, in adjusting the flow of USAID-financed inputs and in making other operational decisions with a minimum of requirements for prior USAID approvals or contract amendments as long as the contractor stays within the bounds of the approved overall plan and budget. In this phase, USAID will give technical assistance contractors the authority and responsibility for using their specialized expertise to the fullest extent in the scheduling and managing of project inputs.
            (4) Monitoring, joint evaluation and replanning. With increased flexibility and responsibility for implementation placed with the technical assistance contractor, the host government, and/or institutional collaborator, improved and timely progress reporting and periodic, joint, and structured reviews of results and evolving plans are imperative as a basis for monitoring and evaluating contractor performance, revalidating or adjusting project design, and for determining future funding levels and commitments.
            Both the contractor's annual report and the joint review should be structured within the framework of purpose, outputs, performance indicators, etc., originally established in the project indentification phase—as modified by detailed project design—and reflected in the Project Agreement and other pertinent documentation. The field review will normally serve as the occasion for discussing changes in or additions to previously agreed-to workplans as well as proposing changes in purpose, types of activities authorized and budgets which require contract amendment. Obviously, the appropriate host government, host institution, and senior contractor officials should be thoroughly involved in the process, which will have to be adapted to the conditions within specific projects and countries. An important USAID responsibility is to assure that there is appropriate host country participation in developing and improving project plans prior to new obligations of funds. The special requirements and responsibilities of the various parties shall also be reflected in the project agreement and contract terms and in guidelines on the content of annual reports, evaluation procedures, etc.
            Standard checking on services actually delivered as a basis for reimbursement will be continued including appropriate audit of expenditures.
            (d) Contracting implications. The principal elements of change in present contracting practices, as detailed below, are earlier selection and involvement of the prime contractor, contracting by major stages of project design and operations, minimizing the need for precontract negotiations and contract amendments and USAID approvals, and providing technical assistance contractors with the authority and responsibility needed to manage implementation within the approved program bounds.
            (1) Selection. The early involvement of the contractor in the definition stage of a long-term technical assistance project, after USAID decides what it wants to undertake in stage (1), does not alter the Agency's responsibility to select its contractors carefully and in full compliance with appropriate contracting regulations and selection procedures. What is required here is that contractor selection be carried out at an earlier stage than has sometimes been the Agency practice in the past or with other types of contracts and in anticipation that the contractor, assuming adequate performance, will participate in all subsequent phases until final completion.
            (2) Contracting stages. In contracting, the initial design stage should be separated from the longer term implementation stage without any USAID commitment to undertake the second until it has exercised its independent judgment based on the product of the first plus any outside expert appraisal it and the host country want to use.
            The long-term implementation stage itself may be further subdivided into contract periods which permit time between predetermined events for analysis, determination of new project requirements, and evaluation of performance prior to initiating the next phase by contract amendment/extension. If, for any reason, such an examination does not appear to warrant project continuation, then termination of the project and/or contract would be the next step.
            (3) Flexible implementation authority. While good project design will eliminate or diminish many operational problems, the very nature of long-term technical assistance requires flexible implementation within agreed purposes, ultimate outputs, types of activity and available financing. With these key variables for USAID management control established, contracts should be written so as to minimize the need for amendments and USAID approval of changes in input particulars. This can be facilitated, both for the USAID, host country, institution, and the contractor by:
            (i) Retention of operational plan in contract and removal of workplan. The contract narrative will contain the life-of-the-project Operational Plan, consistent with the project design as developed in stage (2) and reflected in the project documentation (and subsequent amendments thereto). The Operational Plan includes a statement of the purpose to be achieved, the outputs to be produced by the contractor and the types of activities to be undertaken, the more significant indicators of progress, a general description of the type of inputs that are authorized and intended to be provided during the life of the project, and the overall budget.
            In order to allow adjustments at the implementation level without going through the contract amendment process, the detailed but short-term workplan containing specific descriptions and scheduling of all inputs such as numbers and types of staff, participants, commodities, etc., and specific activities, will not be a part of the contract. It is a working document to be modified in the field when the situation demands. The latest version will be available as a supporting document to justify proposed new obligation levels. Normally, the workplan and derived budget will cover a rolling two year period, i.e., each year another yearly increment is added after review and approval.
            (ii) Budget flexibility. To support this implementation flexibility, contract budget or fiscal controls will be shifted from fixed line items for each input category to program categories, permitting the technical assistance contractor to adjust amounts and timing to achieve previously approved types of activity. This same type of flexibility should apply to any local currency supplied for project operations and/or contractor staff support. While an essential corollary to eliminating the workplan from the contract, this is not a unique procedure under cost reimbursement type contracts when the contractor has demonstrated adequate management capability.
            (iii) Negotiation of advance understandings. To permit university and international research center contractors to manage their activities in accordance with their own policies and procedures and thereby sharpen their management responsibility while achieving substantial savings in time and reduced documentation, USAID may negotiate advance understandings with its technical assistance contractors on dollar costs and administrative procedures that would be included by reference in its subsequent contracts. Upon receipt of a request from the contractor that their policies be reviewed and approved for usage in their contract in lieu of the standard terms and conditions, OP/PS/OCC, USAID/W will initiate negotiations of such policies in an expeditious manner. The approved policies will be used in all relevant relations involving the Agency and respective contractors in lieu of traditional contract standard provisions, whenever this may be appropriate. This does not apply to local currency costs and host government procedures which must be negotiated in each case.
            The purpose of the practices listed above is not only to give a qualified contractor the authority to adjust the composition and timing of inputs but to assign to it clear responsibility for managing such resources, as the evolving circumstances require, to achieve the agreed-upon outputs on a cost efficient basis. It should also reduce the delay and paperwork involved in frequent but minor contract amendments, and approvals. For the agency as a whole, both in the Mission and in USAID/W, these have involved a large workload and cost.
            (e) Role of USAID. Nothing in this appendix is intended to delegate, diminish or otherwise modify USAID's final responsibility for the prudent management of public funds and its own programs. Rather in withdrawing from the day-to-day involvement in and responsibility for the management of adjustment of the flow of inputs during the implementation, the best use of limited agency staff and time can be devoted to protecting the public interest in gaining maximum results from the funds appropriated for technical assistance by:
            (1) Seeking optimum identification in terms of LDC priorities and U.S. capabilities;
            (2) Mobilizing and selecting the best U.S. professional talent to design and carry out the project;
            (3) Monitoring what is happening to assure adequacy of processes, get a feel of results, assure actual delivery of inputs being financed;
            (4) Assuring that the attention of USAID's implementation agents and LDC colleagues stay well focused on project purpose and results to be achieved (outputs) and the relation to these of what is being done and actual results;
            (5) Providing intermediaries adequate authority and responsibility to adjust inputs promptly and sensitively to the evolving project situations.
            Attention to these considerations, and to achievements of the preimplementation conditions prescribed above, should greatly increase the chances for successful project completion and impact on a cost effective basis, which is the final measurement of prudent management.
            Attachment to Appendix F—Guidelines for Requests for Expressions of Interest
            A. Length and Level of Detail
            A Request for Expression of Interest (REI) should include more than just a short letter expressing interest, but should not be in the detail of a technical proposal (RFTP). The REI is not the only source of information that can or should be used for selection, but at least a minimum level of information should be contained in each document. A ten page paper that responds to the selection criteria included in every REI should be sufficient for evaluation purposes. The selection criteria should specify the technical inputs required for successful execution of the project and normally require a response in three general areas:
            1. A description of the institution's capability to address the problem described in the REI.
            2. Any related experience, whether in the country or region or in the problem area.
            3. A demonstrable commitment of the institution to support the project.
            The responses should address the capability, experience, and commitment to the particular project.
            B. Specific Personnel Information
            The response should specify within the areas set out in the selection criteria the following planning and personnel factors.
            1. The design team plan and the scope of work for each member.
            2. A list of candidates for the design team and their credentials.
            3. A list of possible candidates for long-term assignment to the project. (Since there has been no project design, the specific technical assistance slots and technical responsibilities are vague. But it is expected that at least half of the personnel needs can be estimated early in the project. The institution should make its best guess for the team and present to the Agency the persons or types of persons with whom they are likely to contract.)
            C. Multiple Institution Submissions
            Joint effort on the part of several institutions is encouraged when appropriate. A single institution may submit an expression of interest for part of the project without knowledge of other collaborators or it may submit information in response to A and B of this attachment as part of a suggested collection of institutions. In either case, a proposed plan for cooperation is necessary.
            However, such joint efforts must specify the division of responsibilities for the planning and personnel factors indicated in B of this attachment. Often USAID will identify the need for cooperation and suggest such an effort in the REI. Even if USAID does not suggest collaboration, joint efforts with a description of the cooperation would be an appropriate way to respond to an REI.

            Ch. 7, App. I
            Appendix I to Chapter 7—USAID's Academic Publication Policy
            1. Statement of Policy
            This is a statement of USAID policy on publication, or release to parties other than those specifically authorized, of unclassified materials gathered or developed under contracts with academic institutions.
            2. Underlying Principles
            USAID favors and encourages the publication of scholarly research as well as the maximum availability, distribution, and use of knowledge developed in its program.

            This policy statement does not deal with material that is classified for security reasons. It does deal with considerations of national interest, not of sufficient gravity to warrant security classification, but serious enough to affect adversely the conduct of U.S. assistance programs. Consequently, in addition to the requirements of courtesy, propriety, and confidence which normally guide scholars in their work, there should also be consideration of the potential repercussions of publication on the successful execution of development and other cooperative programs in which the United States and foreign countries are involved.
            3. Operational Definitions
            The Agency draws a distinction between two kinds of manuscripts which a scholar may wish to publish:
            (a) A report which is prepared and delivered to the Agency under the terms of the contract (a “contract manuscript”); and
            (b) An article or book based upon experience and information gained under an USAID contract but not prepared or delivered under the contract (a “non-contract manuscript”).
            There are two kinds of actions, to be specified in the contract, which the Agency can take upon notification of a contractor's desire to publish:
            (a) Comment only, under which USAID and the foreign government involved may review the manuscript, and have their comments considered seriously by the contractor prior to publication; and
            (b) Authorization for release, which USAID may withhold if reconciliation between the national interest and the author's interest is impossible.
            4. Policy Statements
            (a) USAID, as a general rule, will not require an academic institution to obtain permission to publish the written work produced under a contract. It will ask for the opportunity to review the manuscript for comment only, prior to publication.
            In the case of a contract manuscript, USAID reserves the right to disclaim endorsement of the opinions expressed; if it is a noncontract manuscript, USAID reserves the right to disassociate itself from sponsorship or publication.
            (b) On the other hand, USAID may reserve the right of authorization for release in those exceptional cases where conditions exist making it reasonably foreseeable, in light of the contract's scope of work and the manner and place of performance, that the written work to be prepared and delivered under the contract may have adverse repercussions on the relations and programs of the United States. Where this right is reserved, it must be so specified in the contract. In determining where to reserve such right, USAID will consider all relevant factors, including:
            (1) The extent to which prompt and full performance of the contract will require access, facilitated by reason of the contract, to information not generally available to scholars;
            (2) The extent to which the work involves matters of political concern to foreign countries, particularly where any substantial part of the work is to be performed therein;
            (3) The extent to which, by reason of USAID's close involvement and cooperation in the performance of the contract, the work product may be so identified with USAID itself as to prevent effective disclaimer of USAID endorsement thereof;
            (4) The extent to which the objective of the contract is to provide advice to USAID or to a foreign government of immediate operational significance in the conduct of the USAID program or the implementation of governmental programs in the host country;
            (5) The desires of the host country.
            5. Implementation
            The successful implementation of this policy on publication rests on a thorough understanding and acceptance of these principles by USAID and the prospective contractor. The actual publications provision for a particular contract, then, would be so worded as to reflect the agreement reached in the contract negotations.
            USAID's concern with noncontract manuscripts is related to the identification of a manuscript with the U.S. Government. This concern will be modified by the passage of time following termination of the contract.
            In the normal case of prepublication review for USAID comment, the institution will submit a copy of the manuscript not later than the date of submission to the publisher. This gives the Agency time to comment if it is deemed appropriate. However, in the case of review for authorization, timely notification of USAID's response will be given, consistent with the size of the manuscript and the number and location of the parties involved.
            The Agency will make every effort to expedite this review procedure in accordance with the underlying principle described at the beginning of this policy statement.

            Ch. 7, App. J
            Appendix J to Chapter 7—Direct USAID Contracts With a Cooperating Country National and With a Third Country National for Personal Services Abroad
            1. General
            (a) Purpose. This appendix sets forth the authority, policy, and procedures under which USAID contracts with cooperating country nationals or third country nationals for personal services abroad.
            (b) Definitions. For the purpose of this appendix:
            (1) Personal services contract (PSC) means a contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).
            (2) Employer-employee relationship means an employment relationship under a service contract with an individual which occurs when, as a result of (i) the contract's terms or (ii) the manner of its administration during performance, the contractor is subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.
            (3) Non-personal services contract means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees.
            (4) Independent contractor relationship means a contract relationship in which the contractor is not subject to the supervision and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. Under these relationships, the Government does not normally supervise the performance of the work, or the manner in which it is to be performed, control the days of the week or hours of the day in which it is to be performed, or the location of performance.
            (5) Contractor means a cooperating country national or a third country national who has entered into a contract pursuant to this appendix.
            (6) Cooperating country means the country in which the employing USAID Mission is located.
            (7) Cooperating country national (CCN) means an individual who is a cooperating country citizen or a non-cooperating country citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the cooperating country.
            (8) Third Country National (TCN) means an individual
            (i) Who is neither a citizen nor a permanent legal resident alien of the United States nor of the country to which assigned for duty, and
            (ii) Who is eligible for return to his/her home country or country of recruitment at U.S. Government expense [see Section 12, General Provision 9 paragraph (n)].
            2. Legal Basis
            (a) Section 635(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, hereinafter referred to as the “FAA”, provides the Agency's contracting authority.
            (b) Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA authorizes the Agency to enter into personal services contracts with individuals for personal services abroad and provides further that such individuals “* * * shall not be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for the purpose of any law administered by the Civil Service Commission.” 1
              
            
            
              
                1 The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of Personnel Management.
            
            3. Applicability
            (a) This appendix applies to all personal services contracts with CCNs or TCNs to provide assistance abroad under Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA.
            (b) This appendix does not apply to:
            (1) Contracts for non-personal services with TCNs or CCNs; such contracts are covered by the basic text of the FAR and AIDAR.
            (2) Personal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens for personal services abroad; such contracts are covered by appendix D of this chapter.
            (3) Appointments of experts and consultants as USAID direct-hire employees; such appointments are covered by USAID Handbook 25, Employment and Promotion or superseding Chapters of the Automated Directive System (ADS).
            4. Policy
            (a) General. USAID may finance, with either program or operating expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services as part of the Agency's program of foreign assistance by entering into a direct contract with a CCN or a TCN for personal services abroad.
            (1) Program funds. Under the authority of Section 636(h) of the FAA, program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.
            (2) Operating expense funds. Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these funds were obligated. Non-recurring cost items may be forward funded for periods not to exceed twenty-four (24) months where necessary and appropriate to accomplishment of the work. 2
              
            
            
              
                2 If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years but only funded as outlined above.
            
            (b) Limitations on Personal Services Contracts. (1) Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is available.

            (2) Personal services contracts may be used for commercial activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.
            
            (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, regulations or delegations, Cooperating Country or Third Country Nationals may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or responsibility, delegated or assigned U.S. citizen direct-hire employees (USDH employees) except that:
            a. They may not supervise USDH employees of USAID or other U.S. Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. citizen employees.
            b. They may not be designated a Contracting Officer or delegated authority to sign obligating or subobligating documents.
            c. They may represent the agency, except that communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must be cleared by a USDH employee.
            d. They may participate in personnel selection matters but may not be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.
            e. Services which involve security classified material.
            (4) Exceptions. Exceptions to the limitations in (b)(3) must be approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).
            (c) Conditions of Employment. (1) General. For the purpose of any law administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, USAID PSC contractors are not to be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government, are not included under any retirement or pension program of the U.S. Government, and are not eligible for the Incentive Awards Program covered by Uniform State/USAID/USIA regulations. Each USAID Mission is expected to participate in the Joint Special Embassy Incentive Awards Program. The program is administered by a joint committee which establishes procedures for submission, review and approval of proposed awards. Other than these exceptions, CCNs and TCNs who are hired for work in a cooperating country under PSCs generally will be extended the same benefits and be subject to the same restrictions as Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) employed as direct-hires by the USAID Mission.
            (2) Compensation. (i) It is USAID's general policy (see AIDAR 722.170) that PSC compensation may not, without the approval of the Mission Director or Assistant Administrator, exceed the prevailing compensation paid to personnel performing comparable work in the cooperating country. Compensation for TCN or CCN personal services contractors set in accordance with the provisions of 4c(2)(ii) below satisfies this requirement.
            (ii) In accordance with Section 408(a)(1) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, a local compensation plan forms the basis for all compensation payments to FSNs which includes CCNs and TCNs. The plan is each post's official system of position classification and pay, consisting of the local salary schedule which includes salary rates, statements authorizing fringe benefit payments, and other pertinent facets of compensation for TCNs and CCNs, and the local position classification system as reflected in the Local Employee Position Classification Handbook (LEPCH) or equivalent in effect at the Mission. Compensation for PSCs will be in accordance with the local compensation plan, to the extent that it covers employees of the type or category being employed, unless the Mission Director determines otherwise. If the Mission Director determines that compensation in accordance with the local plan would be inappropriate in a particular instance, then compensation will be set in accordance with (in order of preference):
            (A) Any other Mission policies on foreign national employee compensation; or
            (B) Paragraphs 4(c) (d), (e), (g), (h), and (i) of appendix D. When compensation is set in accordance with this exception, the record shall be documented in writing with a justification prepared by the requesting office and approved by the Mission Director.
            (iii) The earning of leave (annual and sick), allowances and differential (if applicable), salaries and all other related benefits cannot be enumerated in this appendix as they vary from Mission to Mission and are based upon the compensation plan for each.
            (iv) Unless otherwise authorized, the currency in which compensation is paid to contractors shall be in accordance with the prevailing local compensation practice of the post.
            (v) CCN and TCN contractors are eligible for allowances and differential on the same basis as direct-hire FSN employees under the post compensation plan.
            (vi) A USAID PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired U.S. Civil Service, U.S. Foreign Service, or U.S. military service member, and who is covered by their spouse's government health or life insurance policy, is ineligible for a contribution towards the costs of annual health and life insurance.
            (vii) Retired CCNs and TCNs may be awarded personal services contracts without any reduction in or offset against their Government annuity.
            (3) Incentives Awards. (i) All Cooperating Country Nationals direct-hire and Personal Services Contractors (PSCs) and Third Country Nationals (PSCs) of the Foreign Affairs Community are eligible for the Joint Special Embassy Incentive Awards Program.
            (ii) Meritorious Step Increases for USAID FSN PSCs may be authorized provided the granting of such increases is the general practice locally.

            (iii) The Joint Country Awards Committee administers each post's (Embassy) award program, including establishment of procedures for submission, review and approval of proposed awards.
            
            (4) Training. CCN and TCN PSCs are eligible for most of the training courses offered in the Training Course Schedule. However, applications will be processed on a case-by-case basis and are required to be approved by the Contracting Officer.
            5. Soliciting for Personal Services Contracts
            (a) Technical Officer's Responsibilities. The Technical Officer will prepare a written detailed statement of duties and a statement of minimum qualifications to cover the position being recruited for; the statement shall be included in the procurement request. The procurement request shall also include the following additional information as a minimum:
            (1) The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of frequency);
            (2) The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, plus any options for renewal or extension;
            (3) The basic education, training, experience, and skills required for the position;
            (4) A certification from the officer in the Mission responsible for the LEPCH or equivalent that the position has been reviewed and is properly classified as to a title, series and grade in accordance with the LEPCH. If the position does not fall within the LEPCH or equivalent system, and estimate of compensation based on subparagraphs 4(c)(2)(ii) (A) or (B) of this Appendix after consultations or in coordination with the contract officer or executive officer;
            (5) A list of Government or host country furnished items (e.g., housing).
            (b) Contracting Officer's Responsibilities. (1) The Contracting Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall contain:
            (i) Three sets of certified biographical data and salary history. (Upon receipt, one copy of the above information shall be forwarded to the Project Officer);
            (ii) A detailed statement of duties or a completed position description for the position being recruited for;
            (iii) A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract Schedule, and General Provisions as well as the FAR Clause to be included in full text and a list of those to be incorporated by reference; and
            (iv) A copy of General Notice entitled “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct” dated October 30, 1992.
            (2) The Contracting Officer shall comply with the limitations of AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) below.
            (c) Competition. (1) Under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services Contracts are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:
            (i) Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances, and
            (ii) A justification supporting less than full and open competition must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.
            (2) A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement Executive to satisfy the requirements of AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) for a justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. Use of this class justification for Personal Services Contracts with Cooperating Country Nationals and Third Country Nationals is subject to the following conditions:
            (i) New contracts are publicized consistent with Mission/Embassy practice on announcement of direct hire FSN positions. Renewals or extensions with the same individual for continuing service do not need to be publicized.
            (ii) A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant to AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this class justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is fair and reasonable. If the conditions in paragraphs (2)(i) and (ii) are not followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate justification as required under AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).
            (3) Since the award of a personal services contract is based on technical qualifications, not price, and since the biographical data and salary history are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR Subparts 15.4 and 15.5 are inappropriate and shall not be used. Instead, the solicitation and selection procedures outlined in this appendix shall govern.
            6. Negotiating a Personal Services Contract
            Negotiating a Personal Services Contract is significantly different from negotiating a nonpersonal services contract because it establishes an employer-employee relationship; therefore, the selection and negotiations procedures are more akin to the personal selection procedures.
            (a) Technical Officer's Responsibilities. The Technical Officer shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications received in response to the solicitation issued by the Contracting Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted with the applicants before the final selection is submitted to the Contracting Officer.
            (b) Contracting Officer's Responsibilities. (1) The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of biographical data and salary history received under the solicitation to the Technical Officer for evaluation.

            (2) On receipt of the Technical Officer's recommendation, the Contracting Officer shall conduct negotiations with the recommended applicant. The terms and conditions of the contract will normally be in accordance with the local compensation plan which forms the basis for all compensation on payments paid to FSNs which includes CCNs and TCNs.
            (3) The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history on the certified statement of biographical data and salary history as the basis for salary negotiations, along with the Technical Officer's cost estimate.
            (4) The Contracting Officer will obtain necessary data for a security and suitability clearance to the extent required by USAID Handbook 6, Security or superseding ADS Chapters.
            7. Executing a Personal Services Contract
            Contracting activities, whether USAID/W or Mission, may execute Personal Services Contracts, provided that the amount of the contract does not exceed the contracting authority that has been redelegated to them. See AIDAR 701.601. In executing a personal service contract, the Contracting Officer is responsible for insuring that:
            (a) The proposed contract is within his/her delegated authority;
            (b) A written detailed statement of duties covering the proposed contract has been received;
            (c) The proposed scope of work is contractible, contains a statement of minimum qualifications from the technical office requesting the services, and is suitable for a personal services contract in that:
            (1) Performance of the proposed work requires or is best suited for an employer-employee relationship, and is thus not suited to the use of a non-personal services contract;
            (2) The scope of work does not require performance of any function normally reserved for direct-hire Federal employees (under paragraph 4(b) of this appendix); and
            (3) There is no apparent conflict of interest involved (if the Contracting Officer believes that a conflict of interest may exist, the question should be referred to the cognizant legal counsel);
            (d) Selection of the contractor is documented and justified (AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1) provides an exception to the requirement for full and open competition for Personal Services Contracts abroad; see paragraph 5(c) of this appendix);
            (e) The standard contract format prescribed for a Cooperating Country National and a Third Country National personal services contract (Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of this appendix as appropriate) is used, or that any necessary deviations are processed as required by AIDAR 701.470;
            (f) The contractor has submitted the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of at least two persons who may be notified in the event of an emergency (this information is to be retained in the contract file);
            (g) The contract is complete and correct and all information required on the contract Cover Page (USAID form 1420-36B) has been entered;
            (h) The contract has been signed by the Contracting Officer and the contractor, and fully executed copies are properly distributed;
            (i) The following clearances, approvals and forms have been obtained, properly completed, and placed in the contract file before the contract is signed by both parties:

            (1) Security clearance to the extent required by USAID Handbook 6, Security or other superseding Chapters of the Automated Directives System;
            (2) Mission, host country, and technical office clearance, as appropriate;
            (3) Medical clearance(s) based on a full medical examination(s) and statement of medical opinion by a licensed physician. The physician's medical opinion must be in the possession of the Contracting Officer prior to signature of contract. If a TCN is recruited, medical clearance requirements apply to the contractor and each dependent who is authorized to accompany the contractor;
            (4) The approval for any salary in excess of ES-6, in accordance with appendix G of this chapter;
            (5) A copy of the class justification or other appropriate explanation and support required by AIDAR 706.302-70, if applicable;
            (6) Any deviation to the policy or procedures of this appendix, processed and approved under AIDAR 701.470;
            (7) The memorandum of negotiation;
            (j) The position description is classified in accordance with the LEPCH, and the proposed salary is consistent with the local compensation plan or the alternate procedures established in 4(c)(2)(ii) above;
            (k) Funds for the contract are properly obligated to preclude violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 134 (the Contracting Officer ensures that the contract has been properly recorded by the appropriate accounting office prior to its release for the signature of the selected contractor);
            (l) The contractor receives and understands USAID General Notice entitled “Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct” dated October 30, 1992 and a copy is attached to each contract, as provided for in paragraph (c) of General Provision 2, Section 12;
            (m) Agency conflict of interest requirements, as set out in the above notice are also met by the contractor prior to his/her reporting for duty;

            (n) A copy of a Checklist for Personal Services Contractors which may be in the form set out above or another form convenient for the contracting officer, provided that a form containing all of the information described in this paragraph 7 shall be prepared for each PSC and placed in the contract file;
            (o) In consultation with the regional legal advisor and/or the regional contracting officer, the contract is modified by deleting from the General Provisions (Sections 12 and 13 of this Appendix) the inapplicable clause(s) by a listing in the Schedule; and
            (p) The block entitled, “Acquisition and Assistance Request Document” on the Cover Page of the contract format is completed by inserting the four-segment technical number as prescribed in USAID Handbook 18, the USAID Code Book appendix D or superseding ADS Chapter if the PSC is project-funded.
            8. Contracting Format
            The prescribed Contract Cover Page, Contract Schedules, General Provisions and FAR Clauses for personal service contracts for TCNs and CCNs covered by this Appendix are included as follows:
            9. “Cover Page” for a Contract with a Cooperating Country National or with a Third Country National for Personal Services.
            
            10. “Schedule” for a Contract with a Cooperating Country National or Third Country National Personal Services Contracts.
            
            11. “Optional Schedule” for a Contract with a Cooperating Country National or Third Country National Personal Services Contracts.
            
            [Use of the Optional Schedule is intended to serve as an alternate procedure for OE funded Foreign Service National PSCs. The schedule was developed for use when the Contracting Officer anticipates incremental recurring cost funded contracts. It should be noted that the Optional Schedule eliminates the need to amend the contract each time funds are obligated. However, the Contracting Officer is required to amend each contract not less than twice during a 12 month period to ensure that the contract record of obligations is up to date and agrees with the figures in the master funding document.]
            12. “General Provisions” for a Contract With a Cooperating Country National or With a Third Country National for Personal Services.
            
            13. FAR Clauses to be incorporated in full text as well as by reference in Personal Services Contracts.

For travel to and from post of assignment the TCN contractor shall be reimbursed for travel costs and travel allowances from place of residence in the country of recruitment (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of the travel from the place of residence) to the post of duty in the cooperating country and return to place of residence in the country of recruitment (or other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost of travel from the post of duty in the cooperating country to the contractor's residence) upon completion of services by the individual. Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with USAID's established policies and procedures for its CCN and TCN direct-hire employees and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. If the contract is for longer than one year and the contractor does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the cost of going to and from the post of duty for the contractor and his/her dependents are not reimbursable hereunder. If the contractor serves more than one year but less than the required service in the cooperating country (except for reasons beyond his/her control) costs of going to the post of duty are reimbursable hereunder but the cost of going from post of duty to the contractor's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this contract are not reimbursable under this contract for the contractor and his/her dependents.

One stopover enroute for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations as from time to time amended.
            (c) Local Travel. Reimbursement for local travel in connection with duties directly referable to the contract shall not be in excess of the rates established by the Mission Director for the travel costs of travelers in the Cooperating Country.

            (d) Indirect Travel for Personal Convenience of a TCN. When travel is performed by an indirect route for the personal convenience of the traveler, the allowable costs of such travel will be computed on the basis of the cost of allowable air fare via the direct usually traveled route. If such costs include fares for air or ocean travel by foreign flag carriers, approval for indirect travel by such foreign flag carriers must be obtained from the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director before such travel is undertaken, otherwise only that portion of travel accomplished by the United States-flag carriers will be reimbursable within the above limitation of allowable costs.
            (e) Limitation on Travel by TCN Dependents. Travel costs and allowances will be allowed for authorized dependents of the contractor and such costs shall be reimbursed for travel from place of abode in the country of recruitment to the assigned station in the Cooperating Country and return, only if the dependent remains in the Cooperating Country for at least 9 months or one-half of the required tour of duty of the contract, whichever is greater, except as otherwise authorized hereunder for education, medical, or emergency visitation travel.

            (f) Delays Enroute. The contractor may be granted reasonable delays enroute while in travel status when such delays are caused by events beyond the control of the contractor and are not due to circuitous routing. It is understood that if delay is caused by physical incapacitation, he/she shall be eligible for such sick leave as provided under the “Leave and Holidays” clause of this contract.
            (g) Travel by Privately Owned Automobile (POV). If travel by POV is authorized in the contract schedule or approved by the Contracting Officer, the contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of travel performed in his/her POV at a rate not to exceed that authorized in the Federal Travel Regulations plus authorized per diem for the employee and, if the POV is being driven to or from the cooperating country as authorized under the contract, for each of the authorized dependents traveling in the POV, provided that the total cost of the mileage and per diem paid to all authorized travelers shall not exceed the total constructive cost of fare and normal per diem by all authorized travelers by surface common carrier or authorized air fare, whichever is less.

            (j) Rest and Recuperation Travel. [For TCNs only].
            If approved in writing by the Mission Director, the contractor and his/her dependents shall be allowed rest and recuperation travel on the same basis as direct-hire TCN employees and their dependents at the post under the local compensation plan.
            (k) Transportation of Personal Effects (Excluding Automobiles and Household Goods). [For TCNs only].
            (1) General. Transportation costs will be paid on the same basis as for direct-hire employees at post serving the same length tour of duty, as authorized in the schedule. Transportation, including packing and crating costs, will be paid for shipping from contractor's residence in the country of recruitment or other location, as approved by the Contracting Officer (provided that the cost of transportation does not exceed the cost from the contractor's residence) to post of duty in the cooperating country and return to the country of recruitment or other location provided the cost of transportation of the personal effects of the contractor not to exceed the limitations in effect for such shipments for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations in effect at the time shipment is made. These limitations may be obtained from the Contracting Officer. The cost of transporting household goods shall not exceed the cost of packing, crating, and transportation by surface common carrier.
            (2) Unaccompanied Baggage. Unaccompanied baggage is considered to be those personal belongings needed by the traveler immediately upon arrival of the contractor and dependents. To permit the arrival of effects to coincide with the arrival of the contractor and dependents, consideration should be given to advance shipments of unaccompanied baggage. The contractor will be reimbursed for costs of shipment of unaccompanied baggage (in addition to the weight allowance for household effects) not to exceed the limitations in effect for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations in effect when shipment is made. These limitations are available from the Contracting Officer. This unaccompanied baggage may be shipped as air freight by the most direct route between authorized points of origin and destination regardless of the modes of travel used.
            (l) Reduced Rates on U.S.-Flag Carriers. Reduced rates on U.S.-flag carriers are in effect for shipments of household goods and personal effects of USAID contractors between certain locations. These reduced rates are available provided the shipper furnishes to the carrier at the time of the issuance of the Bill of Lading documentary evidence that the shipment is for the account of USAID. The Contracting Officer will, on request, furnish to the contractor current information concerning the availability of a reduced rate with respect to any proposed shipment. The contractor will not be reimbursed for shipments of household goods or personal effects in amounts in excess of the reduced rates which are available in accordance with the foregoing.
            (m) Transportation of things. [For TCNs Only].

Notwithstanding other provisions of this Clause 9, a TCN must return to the country of recruitment or to the TCN's home country within 30 days after termination or completion of employment or forfeit all right to reimbursement for repatriation travel. The return travel obligation [repatriation travel] assumed by the U.S. Government may have been the obligation of another employer in the area of assignment if the employee has been in substantially continuous employment which provided for the TCN's return to home country or country from which recruited.
            (o) Storage of household effects. [For TCNs Only]. The cost of storage charges (including packing, crating, and drayage costs) in the country of recruitment of household goods of regular employees will be permitted in lieu of transportation of all or any part of such goods to the Cooperating Country under paragraph (k) above provided that the total amount of effects shipped to the Cooperating Country or stored in the country of recruitment shall not exceed the amount authorized for USAID direct-hire employees under the Foreign Service Travel Regulations. These amounts are available from the Contracting Officer.
            
            10. Payment (MAY 1997)

            801.000
            Scope of part.
            This part sets out general Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) policies, including information regarding the maintenance and administration of the VAAR, acquisition policies and practices, and procedures for deviation from the VAAR and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
          
          
            Subpart 801.1—Purpose, Authority, Issuance
            
              801.101
              Purpose.
              (a) VA established the VAAR to codify and publish uniform policies and procedures for VA's acquisition of supplies and services, including construction.
              (b) The VAAR implements and supplements the FAR.
            
            
              801.103
              Authority.
              The Secretary issues the VAAR under the authority of 40 U.S.C. 121(c), Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1.301 through 1.304, and other authorities as cited.
            
            
              801.104
              Applicability.
              (a) Unless otherwise specified in this chapter or excepted by statute (i.e., expenditures of the VA Canteen Service) or other VA regulations, the FAR and VAAR apply to all VA acquisitions (including construction) made with appropriated funds. Supply Fund monies (38 U.S.C. 8121) and General Post Funds (38 U.S.C. 8302) are appropriated funds.
              (b) Use the VAAR and the FAR together. The FAR applies to VA acquisitions except as provided in the VAAR.
            
            
              801.104-70
              Exclusions.
              The FAR and VAAR do not apply to purchases and contracts that use General Post Funds if using the FAR and the VAAR would infringe upon a donor's right to specify the exact item to be purchased and/or the source of supply (38 U.S.C. 8303).
            
            
              801.105

              801.105-2
              Arrangement of regulations.
              (a) General. The VAAR is divided into subchapters, parts (each of which covers a separate aspect of acquisition), subparts, sections, and subsections.
              (b) Numbering. (1) The numbering system permits the discrete identification of every VAAR paragraph. The digits to the left of the decimal point represent the part number. The numbers to the right of the decimal point and to the left of the dash represent, in order, the subpart (one or two digits), and the section (two digits). The number to the right of the dash represents the subsection. Subdivisions may be used at the section and subsection level to identify individual paragraphs.

              (2) Subdivisions below the section or subsection level consist of parenthetical alphanumerics using the following sequence: (a)(1)(i)(A)(1)(i).
              (c) References and citations. (1) Unless otherwise stated, cross-references indicate parts, subparts, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, or subdivisions of this Chapter.
              (2) This chapter may be referred to as the “Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation” or the “VAAR”.
              (3) Using the VAAR coverage at 809.106-4(c) as a typical illustration, reference to the—
              (i) Part would be “VAAR Part 809” outside the VAAR and “Part 809” within the VAAR.
              (ii) Subpart would be “VAAR Subpart 809.1” outside the VAAR and “Subpart 809.1” within the VAAR.
              (iii) Section would be “VAAR 809.106” outside the VAAR and “809.106” within the VAAR.
              (iv) Subsection would be “VAAR 809.106-4” outside the VAAR and “809.106-4” within the VAAR.
              (v) Paragraph would be “VAAR 809.106-4(c)” outside the VAAR and “809.106-4(c)” within the VAAR.

              (4) Citations of authority (e.g., statutes or Executive orders) in the VAAR shall follow the Federal Register form guides.

              (c) The request to deviate must clearly state the circumstances warranting the deviation and the nature of the deviation.
              (d) The DSPE may authorize individual deviations from the FAR and VAAR when an individual deviation is in the best interest of the Government. When the DSPE authorizes a deviation, the contracting officer must file the authorization in the purchase order or contract file.

              801.601
              General.
              (a) The HCA or the DSPE, within their authority, may appoint a contracting officer under FAR 1.603 and VA's Contracting Officer Certification Program (COCP).
              (b) In addition, the HCA may delegate micro-purchase authority to VA employees under VA's purchase card program.
              (c) An individual may not commit the Government for purchases of supplies, equipment, or services unless the individual has received delegated contracting authority as a contracting officer or purchase card holder or as provided in 801.670. Individuals making such commitments or acting beyond the scope of their authority may be held financially liable.
            
            
              801.602
              Contracting officers.
              (a) Except as otherwise provided by statute, VA regulations, the VAAR, or the FAR, the authority vested in the Secretary to do the following is delegated to the SPE and is further delegated from the SPE to the DSPE:
              (1) Execute, award, and administer contracts, purchase orders, and other agreements (including interagency agreements) for the expenditure of funds for construction and the acquisition of personal property and services (including architect-engineer services).
              (2) Issue bills of lading.
              (3) Sell personal property.

              (8) Examine, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the procurement system to determine specific areas where VA should establish and apply Government-wide performance standards, and to participate in developing Government-wide procurement policies, regulations, and standards.
              (9) Oversee the competition advocate program.
              (b) The DSPE may further delegate authority to execute, award, and administer contracts, purchase orders, and other agreements to other VA officials, such as HCAs and contracting officers, in accordance with the COCP.
            
            
              801.602-2
              Responsibilities.

              In the administration of a contract, many problems can and do arise that make the advice and assistance of the Office of General Counsel (OGC) either desirable or necessary. The final decision as to the action to be taken, however, must be made by the contracting officer in each instance. To reduce to the absolute minimum the possibility of litigation resulting from his/her decision, the contracting officer shall submit the problem through channels in sufficient detail to the General Counsel for advice or assistance.
            
            
              801.602-3
              Ratification of unauthorized commitments.
              (a) This section applies to unauthorized commitments, including any commitment made by a contracting officer that exceeds that contracting officer's contracting authority and unauthorized commitments made by individuals who lack contracting authority.
              (b) A contracting officer must not ratify unauthorized commitments made by other VA personnel or by another contracting officer who lacks authority without prior approval as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. The specified approval authorities may not be re-delegated.
              (1) At field facilities, for supplies, services (except leases of real property), and construction, the approving authority for unauthorized commitments made by staff assigned to a field facility is the HCA.
              (2) For VA Central Office (VACO) organizations, for supplies, services (except leases of real property), and construction, the approving authorities for unauthorized commitments made by staff assigned to the Administrations are the respective chief financial officers of the Administrations concerned. The approving authority for unauthorized commitments made by staff assigned to any other organization within VACO is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management.
              (3) For unauthorized commitments for leasehold interest in real property, the approving authority is:
              (i) The Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, for unauthorized commitments for 1-5,000 square feet of space or for 1-100 parking spaces costing less than $50,000 per annum.
              (ii) The Under Secretary for Health for unauthorized commitments for 5,001-20,000 square feet of space or for more than 100 parking spaces costing less than $100,000 per annum.
              (iii) The Deputy Secretary for 20,001 square feet of space and above or for more than 100 parking spaces costing more than $100,000 per annum.
              (c) The process for contracting officer requests for ratification will be as follows:
              (1) The individual who made the unauthorized commitment will furnish the contracting officer with all records and documents concerning the commitment and a complete written statement of facts that includes the following:
              (i) Why the procurement office was not used.
              (ii) Why the proposed contractor was selected.
              (iii) Other sources that were considered.
              (iv) A description of work to be performed or products to be furnished.
              (v) The estimated or agreed contract price.
              (vi) A citation of the appropriation available.
              (vii) A statement of whether the contractor has commenced performance.
              (viii) The name of the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.
              (2) The contracting officer will review the file and forward it to the approving authority specified in paragraph (b) of this section with any comments or information that the approving authority should consider in evaluating the request for ratification. If the approving authority determines that a legal review would be desirable, the approving authority will coordinate the request for ratification with OGC or the Regional Counsel, as appropriate.
              (3) If the approving authority authorizes the ratification, the approving authority will return the file to the contracting officer for issuance of a purchase order or contract, as appropriate.
              (d) If an otherwise proper contract award exceeds the limits of the contracting officer's delegated authority, the ratifying contracting officer must comply with the above requirements and the approving authority must inform the HCA. The HCA will take action to preclude future instances of such awards.
            
            
              
              801.602-70
              General review requirements.
              (a) Contracting officers shall ensure that any document listed under 801.602-71 through 801.602-76 that is submitted for technical or legal review is submitted through or by an official at least one level above the contracting officer.
              (b) Before opening a bid, awarding a contract, or signing a contract-related document as specified in 801.602-71 through 801.602-76, the contracting officer shall ensure that the appropriate VA official, including appropriate staff of the Acquisition Resources Service regional or VA Central Office, has reviewed and concurred with the document.
              (c) Before signing a contract for a Veterans Benefits Administration field facility for any guidance center or vocational rehabilitation service with an anticipated expenditure of $100,000 or more, the contracting officer shall ensure that the Director, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service, has reviewed and approved the solicitation or proposed contract.
              (d) When the following items are for the management, sale, or lease of properties acquired by VA after liquidation of a guaranteed, direct, acquired, or vendee loan, the review requirements specified in 801.602-71 through 801.602-76 do not apply:
              (1) Agreements.
              (2) Licenses.
              (3) Easements.
              (4) Deeds.
              (e) If there is insufficient time for the legal review required in 801.602-75(a)(3), the contracting officer (except contracting officers in the Office of Construction and Facilities Management) must at least obtain verbal concurrence from Acquisition Resources Service staff before issuing a change order where:
              (1) The change order (unilateral agreement) has an anticipated value of $100,000 or more; or
              (2) The change order is for a time extension of 60 days or more.
              (f) Unless otherwise stated, all dollar values in 801.602-71 through 801.602-76 are expressed in total dollars involved in the acquisition action.
              (1) The contracting officer may not consider the positive and negative status of the figures in determining the total dollar values involved.
              (2) An acquisition of $550,000 with a trade-in credit of $70,000 would be valued at $620,000 for legal or technical review purposes rather than the net amount of $480,000. An Energy Savings Performance Contract requiring payment from savings of $10,000,000 to the contractor over the life of the contract would be valued at $10,000,000, despite the fact that there is no immediate cost to VA and no payment if there are no savings.

              801.602-72
              Exceptions and additional review requirements.
              (a) In addition to the general review requirements in 801.602-71, contracting officers must obtain technical reviews from Acquisition Resources Service staff of any proposed agreement that is unique, novel, or unusual.
              (b) Contracting officers must obtain technical reviews from Acquisition Resources Service staff of the following:
              (1) Documents relating to bonds (see FAR 28.102-1 and 28.203 through 28.203-5) as follows:
              (i) An irrevocable letter of credit.
              (ii) A tripartite escrow agreement.
              (iii) An individual surety bond. (Note that the FAR at 28.203(f) also requires legal review of the documents pledging the assets of an individual surety.)
              (2) Proposed novation and change-of-name agreements (see FAR Subpart 42.12).
              (3) Solicitations or proposed contracts containing an economic price adjustment clause (other than a pre-approved VA clause) based on a cost index of material or labor (e.g., the urban consumer price index (CPI-U) (see FAR 16.203-4(d)) or where one of the economic price adjustment clauses specified in FAR 16.203-4 are used.
              (4) Proposed multi-year contracts where the cancellation ceiling exceeds 20 percent of the contract amount, regardless of the dollar value of the proposed contract (see 817.105-1(b)).
              (5) Proposed solicitations where the contract term total of the basic and option periods may exceed 5 years, regardless of the dollar value of the proposed acquisition (see 817.204).
              (6) Proposed membership agreements in a group purchasing organization.
              (7) A proposed termination settlement or determination of amounts due the contractor under a terminated contract that involves the expenditure of $100,000 or more of Government funds. Acquisition Resources Service staff shall obtain legal review (see 849.111-70).
              (8) Consignment agreements with an anticipated expenditure of $250,000 or more per year (except for a consignment agreement established under, and provided for in, a Federal Supply Schedule contract).
              (c) Contracting officers, including purchase card holders, must obtain technical and legal review of all proposed contracts with hotels or similar facilities for conferences or similar functions (e.g., training, meetings) where VA's commitment, expenditure, and liability (combined) exceed $25,000. This dollar figure is based on the combination of all direct costs to VA under the contract (e.g., conference rooms, audio-visual charges, refreshments, catering) and all potential liability (e.g., room guarantee liability, cancellation costs). Even if there is no direct cost to VA, if the proposed contract includes a guarantee on room usage or a cancellation fee that could potentially exceed $25,000, the proposed contract requires legal and technical review. Signing a contract committing VA to hold a conference at a particular hotel is a procurement and procurement laws and regulations must be followed.
            
            
              801.602-73

              (1) Each contract termination, final decision, cure letter, or “show cause” notice proposed under any contract where the total value of the contract is $100,000 or more. A contracting officer may not sign or release a document subject to this provision until OGC has concurred.
              (2) Each dispute or claim from a contractor involving a potential total dollar value of $100,000 or more. A contracting officer may not sign or release a document subject to this provision until OGC has concurred.
              (3) Each proposed contract modification, including any proposed modification to a supply or service contract, where the total value of the modification is $100,000 or more (e.g., a modification for a $60,000 increase and a $50,000 decrease equals $110,000). Contract modifications issued only to exercise contract options are exempt from this review requirement.
              (4) Each proposed contract modification granting a time extension of more than 60 days. The Director, Acquisition Resources Service, may waive the pre-approval requirement under this paragraph for an individual facility when the Director determines that the facility has obtained appropriate “consideration” for past time extensions and the extensions were otherwise appropriately granted.
              (5) Each proposed modification increasing the value of a letter contract, regardless of dollar value.
              (6) Each proposed contract modification for which the contractor takes exception to the accord and satisfaction language specified by VA.

              (9) Each change or revision to a prescribed VA contract form.
              (10) A proposed utility construction or connection contract with an anticipated contract award value of $50,000 or more.
              (11) Each proposed novation and change-of-name agreement (see 842.1203).
              (b) For an action specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, OGC may comment or concur in writing or by telephone.

              (c) When a Central Office contracting activity requests legal assistance, the contracting officer will brief OGC on the facts and points of issue to facilitate prompt resolution.
              (d) For each solicitation or contract awarded and administered by a Central Office contracting activity, that contracting activity will ask OGC to participate in conferences where legal problems or modifications to contract provisions may be considered and in meetings attended by legal representatives of private parties or other Government agencies. The contracting activity will request assigned procurement counsel participation in drafting correspondence involving significant controversial or sensitive contractual matters.
              (e) OGC will prepare any response to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on GAO bid protests. (See 833.104).
            
            
              801.602-76
              Business clearance review.
              (a) A business clearance review is a technical review of all solicitation and contract award or modification documents immediately prior to contract award or modification over the specified dollar threshold.
              (b) All VA contracting officers must obtain a business clearance review prior to award of any contract, task or delivery order, or blanket purchase agreement or execution of any contract modification with a value of $5 million or more or prior to award of any lease with a value of $300,000 or more per year.
              (c) The dollar threshold in this paragraph is based on the total dollar value of all awards expected under a single solicitation, not the value of each individual award under a solicitation. For example, a solicitation for home oxygen for a Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) might result in multiple awards, each of which has a value of less than $5 million. If the total of all awards under that solicitation will exceed $5 million, the contracting officer must obtain a business clearance review of the entire package, including all proposed individual awards.
            
            
              801.602-77

              (a) Under 801.602-70 through 801.602-76, before taking contract action, a contracting officer must ensure that any required legal or technical review or concurrence is complete. Contracting officers shall not award or sign contracts, task or delivery orders, blanket purchase agreements, or contract modifications prior to receipt of the final legal and technical review. Should the contracting officer disagree with the advice provided, the contracting officer shall document in the contract file the reasons therefore and provide a copy of that document to the reviewing Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management office. The contracting officer must fully implement any accepted review comments as follows:
              (1) Before opening the bid or proposal for a competitively awarded contract.
              (2) Before executing contract documents for a contract modification or noncompetitive contract award.
              (b) The contracting officer must advise potential bidders or offerors of changes made to the solicitation by issuing an amendment. The contracting officer must give bidders and offerors sufficient time for evaluation before the bid or proposal opens.

              (i) Except for a contract for blood, the contracting officer may delegate this authority only to other Government contracting officers under centralized indefinite delivery type contracts and the contract will so state.
              (ii) A centralized contract for blood must state that a contracting officer at an ordering office may designate representatives and alternate representatives to place a delivery order subject to the same restrictions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

              801.670-1
              Issuing bills of lading.
              The authority to issue bills of lading previously contained in this section is rescinded. Except for individual small package shipments (e.g., United Parcel Service, Federal Express, or United States Postal Service small package shipments), no VA employee may issue a bill of lading or otherwise procure transportation services for goods unless the employee has been delegated authority to do so as a warranted contracting officer under the VA Contracting Officer Certification Program (ref. 801.690). All transportation services for goods, other than for small package shipments, require a bill of lading. Except for individual small package shipments, individuals with only micro-purchase authority may not issue bills of lading or otherwise procure transportation services. The dollar value of the bill of lading issued or transportation services acquired must not exceed the delegated authority of the contracting officer. Candidates for appointment as transportation contracting officers whose delegated authority will be limited to the acquisition of transportation services for goods only shall comply with the Education, Experience, and Training requirements, if any, in Part 102-117 of title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, the Federal Management Regulation, rather than the requirements in 801.690.
            
            
              801.670-3
              Medical, dental, and ancillary service.
              (a) When medical, dental, and ancillary services under $10,000 per authorization are not available from an existing contract or agreement, the following VA officials at VA medical facilities may authorize these services:
              (1) The Chief of Staff and the physician assigned the responsibility for the ambulatory care function.
              (2) Chief, Medical Administration Service, or the person designated by the facility director to perform medical administration functions.
              (b) Forms specified in Part 853 shall be used for ordering services under this paragraph from existing contracts.
              (c) The officials named in paragraph (a) of this section may designate one or more of their subordinates to exercise the authority in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (d) A designation under this section must be in writing and specifically set forth the scope and limitations of the designee's authority.

              801.670-5
              Letters of agreement.
              (a) Letters of agreement shall not be used. The authority previously contained in this section is rescinded.
              (b) The VA Office of Inspector General may issue contracts for commercial items, including services, using a letter format (see FAR 12.204(a)), provided billing information and required clauses are included in the contract. If the dollar value of the acquisition will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, this is a deviation from the requirement to use Standard Form 1449 at FAR 12.204(a).
            
            
              801.680
              Contracting authority of the Inspector General.

L. 95-452) and for contracting officers designated in sections 801.670 through 801.670-5. The COCP also applies to VA officials granted authority to enter into sales agreements (see separate guidance under VA's Directives Management System).
              (b) A Certificate of Appointment is not required for a contracting officer designated in 801.670 who exercises special and limited delegations of authority.
              (c) Warrant levels are synonymous with the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Program certification levels specified in the OFPP Memorandum dated January 20, 2006, titled “The Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Program.” The COCP is based on the following levels and types of authority:
              (1) Level I warrant. Authority for expenditures at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (see FAR 2.101) for open market contracts, blanket purchase agreements, basic ordering agreements, and delivery/task orders against established contracts (except Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts), within the specified geographical limits of the contracting officer's warrant. For FSS contracts, Level I warrant authority includes authority for expenditures up to the maximum order threshold of the FSS contract, within the specified geographical limits of the contracting officer's warrant. This level was formally titled “Basic” and any current Basic Level warrant need not be reissued solely to change the title.
              (2) Level II warrant. Authority for expenditures at or below $5,000,000 or as stated on Standard Form 1402 for open market contracts, blanket purchase agreements, basic ordering agreements, and delivery/task orders against established contracts, within the specified geographic limits of the contracting officer's warrant. This level was formally titled “Intermediate” and any current Intermediate Level warrant need not be reissued solely to change the title.
              (3) Level III (Senior Limited) warrant. Authority for expenditures at or below the dollar threshold and within the geographical limits specified on the contracting officer's warrant, Standard Form 1402. This level was formally titled “Senior Limited” and any current Senior Limited Level warrant need not be reissued solely to change the title.
              (4) Level III (Senior Unlimited) warrant. Authority granted to VA's contracting officers in contracting activities (e.g., the VA National Acquisition Center, Hines, IL, and Acquisition Operations Service, VA Central Office, Washington, DC) that are charged with meeting Department-wide acquisition needs of VA and its customers. The authority is for expenditures at any dollar level without geographical restriction. This level was formally titled “Senior Unlimited” and any current Senior Unlimited Level warrant need not be reissued solely to change the title.
              (5) Multi-VISN. Authority at the Level II warrant and Level III (Senior Limited) warrant levels, granted by the DSPE, that permits procurement consolidations among Veterans Health Administration VISNs, Veterans Benefits Administration Area Offices, and other Government agencies that exist outside the contracting officer's normally assigned geographical area of appointed authority. Multi-VISN authority is generally granted to contracting officers for procurement-specific requirements or to contracting officers who are members of groups or consortiums established for regional contracting initiatives.
              (d) Micro-purchase Level. Micro-purchase Level authority, not to exceed the micro-purchase threshold (currently $3,000) ($2,500 for acquisition of services subject to the Service Contract Act, and $2,000 for acquisition of construction subject to the Davis Bacon Act) (see FAR 2.101), is separately addressed under VA's purchase card program. Under that program, the HCA may delegate authority to a VA employee as a purchase card holder through the issuance of VA Form 0242.

              801.690-5
              Requirements for contracting authority.

              (a) Effective January 1, 2007, no individual, regardless of job series, may be issued a new contracting officer warrant above the micro-purchase threshold unless the individual meets the requirements for Federal Acquisition Certification (Certification) for the applicable Level I, II, or III warrant level as specified in OFPP Policy Letter 05-01 and the OFPP Memorandum dated January 20, 2006, titled “the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Program.” A new contracting officer warrant is defined in OFPP Policy Letter 05-01 as a warrant issued for the first time at a department or agency. For contracting officers warranted before January 1, 2007, certification will not be required to retain their existing warrants, but will be required before higher level warrants can be issued. Certification includes minimum requirements for education, training, and experience. A candidate for a warrant must have at least a satisfactory-or-above performance rating during the most recent performance period.
              (b) For contracting officer warrants issued prior to January 1, 2007, the minimum requirements for qualifying as a contracting officer previously specified in VA regulation and other internal VA guidance shall apply.
              (c) Multi-VISN. The HCA shall obtain written or e-mail concurrence from the HCAs of the other affected VISNs or Area Offices when requesting Multi-VISN contracting authority.
              (d) Training. (1) Contracting officers and non-warranted contract specialists shall complete the required coursework and on-the-job training needed to possess the established competencies listed in OFPP's Federal Acquisition Institute Contract Specialist Training Blueprints (http://www.fai.gov/policies/contract.htm).
              (2) The Chief, ATCD, oversees the ATP.
              (3) Training course equivalency will be determined and approved by the Chief, ATCD. Candidates should contact the Chief, ATCD, for an equivalency determination and must furnish any information or evidence necessary to support the request. Appeals of decisions may be made to the VA ACM and the decisions of the ACM shall be final.
              (e) Skills Currency. (1) Contracting officers and non-warranted contract specialists who have completed the core training requirements shall obtain a minimum of 80 CLPs of continuing education or training every two fiscal years to stay abreast of current acquisition knowledge and skills as mandated by OFPP. The HCA (for Level I warrant contracting officers) and the Chief, ATCD (for Level II warrant and Level III warrant contracting officers), shall make written determinations every October 1 for each warranted contracting officer on whether the required CLPs, as specified in OFPP guidance, were completed during the two prior fiscal years. The HCA shall assign CLP values to training taken by Level I warrant contracting officers for training that does not have pre-assigned CLP or continuing education unit (CEU) values assigned to the training by the provider. The Chief, ATCD, shall assign CLP values to training taken by Level II warrant and Level III warrant contracting officers for training that does not have pre-assigned CLP or CEU values assigned to the training by the provider. Values shall be assigned based on guidance provided by OFPP and the combined efforts of the Federal Acquisition Institute and the Defense Acquisition University. Questions regarding the CLP or CEU values assigned to training shall be resolved by the ACM.
              (2) The Chief, ATCD, is responsible for the management of the ACEP, the program that assists contracting officers and contract specialists to meet the training requirements.
              (3) An expiring warrant will not be re-issued if the contracting officer has not met the continuing education or training requirement.
              (f) Education. (1) The 24 business-related college credits shall be in any combination of the following fields of study at an accredited college or university: accounting, business, finance, law, contracts, purchasing, economics, industrial management, marketing, quantitative methods, or organization and management.
              (2) The HCA will make the final determination whether a course is accepted as business-related for the purpose of granting Level I warrant authority. The Chief, ATCD, will make the final determination whether a course is accepted as business-related for the purpose of granting Level II warrant or Level III warrant contracting authority.
              (3) American Council on Education (ACE) credits are not considered as college credits until they are converted and included on a transcript from an accredited college or university.
              (g) Grandfather provision for the education requirement. (1) VA contracting officers, regardless of grade level, who currently hold Level I, Level II, or Level III (Senior Limited or Unlimited) warrants are considered as having met the Experience, Education, and Training requirements for their respective warrant levels. This includes transfers or laterals to other VA contracting activities with similar geographical restrictions. Contracting officers who are promoted up to a GS-12 can maintain their current warrant level authority.
              (2) This Grandfather provision does not cover new VA employees, current VA employees who are not warranted, former VA employees who held contracting authority at their previous Federal Government agencies or VA positions, or VA employees whose warrants have been rescinded or have expired. VA contracting officers who are promoted to GS 13-and-above will no longer be covered by this Grandfather provision and, therefore, must meet the current Experience, Education, and Training requirements for the specific warrant authority that they currently hold or to which they wish to be appointed. Contracting officers requesting a higher level warrant (e.g., from Level I warrant to Level II warrant or from Level III (Senior Limited) warrant to Level III (Senior Unlimited) warrant) must also meet the current Experience, Education, and Training requirement for the specific warrant authority requested.
              (3) This Grandfather provision for retaining a contracting officer's current warrant authority is voided if the contracting officer does not fully meet the minimum Skills Currency requirement prior to warrant expiration or when the warrant authority is suspended or revoked. The contracting officer will then need to meet all of the current warrant prerequisites before a new warrant can be issued or before the suspended or revoked warrant can be reinstated.
              (h) The training requirements for contracting officers whose delegated authority is limited to the acquisition of transportation services, as provided in part 102-117 of title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, the Federal Management Regulation, shall be as specified therein.

HCAs may submit a recommendation to revoke or rescind the appointment of a contracting officer's Level II warrant or Level III (Senior Limited or Unlimited) warrant to the DSPE. Revocation may be based on the following circumstances:
              (1) There is no longer a need for the appointment;
              (2) There has been a personnel action such as a resignation, retirement, transfer;
              (3) Unsatisfactory performance;
              (4) Alleged official misconduct pending criminal or administrative investigations;
              (5) Failure to meet training or skills currency requirements;
              (6) A contracting officer taking an action that exceeds his or her authority;
              (7) Blatant disregard for adhering to acquisition regulations, policies and procedures; or
              (8) Situations similar to those in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section that may require remedial action.

              (b) The HCA should discuss a termination of contracting authority for cause with the servicing Human Resource Management Office to determine the impact, if any, on the contracting officer's continued employment.
              (c) All changes in the status (e.g., departure, name, position, or grade change) of a micro-purchase cardholder or Level I warrant holder shall be reported in writing by the individual's supervisor to the HCA within five workdays of occurrence. All changes in the status of a Level II warrant or Level III (Senior Limited or Unlimited) warrant holder shall be reported in writing by the HCA to the DSPE within five workdays of occurrence. Level II warrants or Level III (Senior Limited or Unlimited) warrants that are terminated, rescinded, or superseded should be returned to the Director, Acquisition Resources Service (049A5), citing the exact reason for the termination, rescission, or supersession.

              Interim appointment provisions.
              (a) To ensure availability of procurement support, an interim appointment may be granted for a limited period of time when a candidate does not fully meet the minimum qualifications for Experience, Education, or successful completion of all acquisition Training requirements in previous VA regulations or VA internal guidance, if applicable, or as provided in the OFPP Memorandum dated January 20, 2006, titled “the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Program.” All interim appointments made after January 1, 2007, for individuals who do not meet the minimum Experience, Education, or Training requirements for Levels I through III warrants shall be signed by the SPE or, if so delegated, the ACM, without power to redelegate, as provided in the OFPP Memorandum dated January 20, 2006, titled “the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Program.”
              (1) In a request for an interim appointment, the HCA must include the information required by 801.690-4 on the candidate's training, experience, performance, and education, and a justification for the interim appointment.

              Policy.
              VA policy prohibits contractors from making references in its commercial advertising to VA contracts in a manner that states or implies the Government approves or endorses the product or service or considers it superior to other products or services.

              (1) Scarce Medical Specialist contracts negotiated under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 7409, but only when such contracts are with institutions affiliated with VA under 38 U.S.C. 7302. (38 U.S.C. 7409)

              (2) Contracts for health-care resources negotiated under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8153, but only when such contracts are with institutions affiliated with VA under 38 U.S.C. 7302, including medical practice groups and other approved entities associated with affiliated institutions (entities will be approved if determined legally to be associated with affiliated institutions), or with blood banks, organ banks, or research centers. The justification and approval requirements of FAR 6.303 and 806.304 do not apply to such contracts or agreements. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

              (b) Various sections of title 38 U.S.C. authorize the Secretary to enter into certain contracts and certain types of contracts without regard to any other provisions of law.

(38 U.S.C. 8109)
              (4) For contracts for laundry and other common services, such as the purchase of steam, negotiated with non-profit, tax-exempt, educational, medical, or community institutions, when specifically approved by the Secretary or designee and when such services are not reasonably available from private commercial sources, cite 38 U.S.C. 8122(c). (38 U.S.C. 8122)
              (5) For contracts or agreements with public or private agencies for services of translators, cite 38 U.S.C. 513. (38 U.S.C. 513)
              (c) Except for an acquisition under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the contracting officer must provide a justification under FAR 6.303 and obtain an approval under 806.304 for each acquisition described in this section.

              (a) When the contracting officer uses 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(7) to support a contract award using other than full and open competition, the contracting officer must prepare a Determination and Finding (D&F) under FAR 1.7 and a justification under FAR 6.303. The D&F must be signed by the Secretary.
              (b) The contracting officer must submit the D&F and justification through the HCA to the Agency Competition Advocate for signature by the Secretary. The submission must include the date the contracting officer expects to award the contract.
              (c) VA must notify Congress 30 days before the expected award date. The Agency Competition Advocate is responsible for preparing this notice. The contracting officer may not award the contract until notified by the Agency Competition Advocate.

              807.300
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart prescribes the use of VAAR clause at 852.207-70, Report of employment under commercial activities, when contracting for commercial services under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 or VA's cost comparison process. The cost comparison process is used by VA to determine whether to use commercial or Government resources to provide commercial services.
            
            
              807.304-77
              Right of first refusal.

              (a) In addition to the Right of First Refusal of Employment clause specified in FAR 52.207-3, the contracting officer must include the clause “Report of Employment Under Commercial Activities” at 852.207-70 in all cost comparison solicitations where VA personnel may be displaced. This clause is primarily intended to verify that the contractor is meeting its obligation to provide Federal workers who are adversely affected by the contract award and who are qualified for the jobs the first opportunity for employment openings created by the contract.
              (b) The Report of Employment Under Commercial Activities clause is also prescribed to avoid inappropriate severance payment. To implement the clause, the contracting officer (or COTR) must first obtain a list of Federal personnel who will be adversely affected as a result of the anticipated contract from the servicing Human Resources Service office. The list should be requested as soon as a preliminary determination is made to contract out a function subject to OMB Circular A-76.

            Priorities for use of mandatory Government sources.
            (a) Sources. Contracting activities shall satisfy requirements for supplies and services from or through the mandatory sources listed below in descending order of priority:
            (1) Supplies. (i) VA inventories including the VA supply stock program (41 CFR 101-26.704) and VA excess.
            (ii) Excess from other agencies (see FAR subpart 8.1).
            (iii) Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (see VAAR 808.603). Prior to considering award of a contract to Federal Prison Industries, Inc, contracting officers shall apply the VA Rule of Two to determine whether a requirement should be awarded to veteran-owned small businesses under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127-28, by using the preferences and priorities in subpart 819.70. If an award is not made to a VIP-listed and verified service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB)/veteran-owned small business (VOSB) as provided in subpart 819.70, FPI remains a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002.
            (iv) Supplies that are on the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, known as AbilityOne (FAR subpart 8.7). Prior to considering award of a contract under the AbilityOne program, contracting officers shall apply the VA Rule of Two to determine whether a requirement should be awarded to veteran-owned small businesses under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127-28, by using the preferences and priorities in subpart 819.70. If an award is not made to a VIP-listed and verified SDVOSB/VOSB as provided in subpart 819.70, AbilityOne remains a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002. All new VA requirements must be approved by the Chief Acquisition Officer, via the Senior Procurement Executive, before contacting the Committee to request addition of new items to the Procurement List.
            (v) Wholesale supply sources, such as stock programs of the General Services Administration (GSA) (see 41 CFR 101-26.3), the Defense Logistics Agency (see 41 CFR 101-26.6), the Department of Veterans Affairs (see 41 CFR 101-26.704), and military inventory control points.
            (2) Services that are on the Procurement List maintained by the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, known as AbilityOne (FAR subpart 8.7). Prior to considering award of a contract under the AbilityOne program, contracting officers shall apply the VA Rule of Two to determine whether a requirement should be awarded to veteran-owned small businesses under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127-28, by using the preferences and priorities in subpart 819.70. If an award is not made to a VIP-listed and verified SDVOSB/VOSB as provided in subpart 819.70, AbilityOne remains a mandatory source in accordance with FAR 8.002. All new VA requirements must be approved by the Chief Acquisition Officer, via the Senior Procurement Executive, before contacting the Committee to request addition of new items to the Procurement List.
            (b) Unusual and compelling urgency. The contracting officer may use a source other than those listed in paragraph (a) of this section when the need for supplies or services is of an unusual and compelling urgency (see FAR 6.302-2, 8.405-6 and 13.106-1 for justification requirements).
            (c) Eligible Beneficiaries. (1) A contracting officer may authorize an acquisition from the Veterans Canteen Service or a commercial source when a VA healthcare official (e.g., social worker, physician) determines that personal selection of shoes, clothing, and incidentals will result in a therapeutic benefit to an eligible beneficiary.
            (2) The contracting officer must cite Federal Prison Industries, Inc., clearance No. 1206 in the purchase document for any purchase from a commercial source of dress shoes similar to Federal Prison Industries, Inc., Style No. 86-A.

              (b) An appropriate specialist will assist the contracting officer in developing the special standards under paragraph (a) of this section.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, a committee under the direction of the contracting officer and composed of representatives of the medical service or using service chiefs or designees appointed by the facility or VISN director will conduct a pre-award on-site evaluation of the plant, personnel, equipment and processes of the prospective contractor for contracts covering the products and services of the following:
              (1) Bakeries.
              (2) Dairies.
              (3) Ice cream plants.
              (4) Laundry and dry cleaning activities.
              (b) Before any inspection, the contracting officer will determine whether another VA facility or another Federal agency has recently inspected and approved the plant.
              (1) The contracting officer will accept an approved inspection report of another VA facility.
              (2) If another Federal agency made a plant inspection not more than 6 months before the proposed VA contract period, the contracting officer may accept an approved inspection report of that other Federal agency as satisfactory evidence that the facilities of the bidder meet the bid requirements.
              (c) VA will not conduct a pre-award on-site evaluation of a dairy plant when VA receives an acceptable bid from a supplier of dairy products designated as No.1 in the Federal Specifications if the following conditions are met:
              (1) The supplier has received a pasteurized milk rating of 90 percent or more for the type of product being supplied, on the basis of the U.S. Public Health Service milk ordinance and code.
              (2) The rating is current (not over 2 years old) and has been determined by a certified State milk sanitation rating officer in the State of origin or by the Public Health Service. The contractor must maintain the rating of 90 percent or more during the period of the contract.
              (3) The solicitation specifications must include the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

              (d) A dairy plant that does not meet paragraph (c) of this section may offer only dairy products designated as No. 2 in the Federal Specifications. VA will make an award to such a firm only after it completes a pre-award on-site evaluation conducted under paragraph (a) of this section.
              
              (e) Before it makes an open market purchase of fresh bakery products (such as pies, cakes, and cookies), VA will inspect and evaluate the plant where these products are produced or prepared under paragraph (a) of this section. VA will make an on-site evaluation at least annually and record the results on VA Form 10-2079, Inspection Report of Bakery.

              809.201
              Definitions.
              For the purposes of this subpart:
              
                VA QPL means a VA Qualified Products List, a list of products qualified by the VA under VA specifications, or purchase descriptions, or commercial item descriptions.
              
                VISN QPL means a VISN Qualified Products List, a list of products qualified by a VISN under VA specifications, or purchase descriptions, or commercial item descriptions.
            
            
              809.202
              Policy.
              The HCA may sign a justification required by FAR 9.202(a)(1).
            
            
              809.204
              Responsibilities for establishment of a qualification requirement.
              (a) Under FAR Subpart 9.2, VA may create VA QPLs for use on individual solicitations or on multiple solicitations issued by one or more VA facilities.
              (b) An HCA or designee must support the creation of a VA QPL using one or more of the following justifications:
              (1) The time required for testing the product after award would unduly delay product delivery.
              (2) The cost of repetitive product testing would be excessive.
              (3) Testing the product would require purchasing an expensive or complicated apparatus not commonly available.
              (4) It is in the Government's interest to be assured before contract award that the product is satisfactory for its intended use.
              (5) Determining acceptability would require providing product performance data to supplement technical requirements in the specification.
              (6) Conducting a test would result in substantial or repetitive rejections.
              (7) VA cannot economically develop clear, professional specifications for the product performance, balance, design, or construction, and professional judgment is required to determine whether the product is acceptable under VA requirements.
              (c) If VA plans to establish a VA QPL for any given product, the contracting officer may limit known suppliers to suppliers whose products are covered by a Federal Supply Schedule contract, as provided at FAR Subpart 8.4.
              (d) VA will pay the costs to inspect and test a product sample submitted under this section.
              (1) The product supplier must pay for the sample and its transportation to the place of inspecting and testing.
              (2) After inspection and testing, VA will return any product sample to the supplier “as is” unless:
              (i) The inspection or test destroys the sample; or
              (ii) The supplier authorizes VA to retain or dispose of the sample.
              (e) Once VA accepts a product for the VA QPL, VA may review the product for compliance with the applicable specification at any time.
              (1) Where there is a variance between a VA specification that was the basis for the VA QPL and the product furnished by the supplier, the supplier must furnish an item that conforms to the VA specification.
              (2) If the supplier fails to or is unable to provide a product that conforms to the applicable VA specification, the product will be removed from the VA QPL.
              (f) VA's acceptance of a product for listing on the VA QPL does not:
              (1) Guarantee that VA will accept the product in any future purchase; or
              (2) Constitute a waiver of the specifications as to acceptance, inspection, testing, or other provisions of any future contract involving the product.

              (a) Each VISN Nutrition and Food Service representative is authorized to establish a common VISN QPL for convenience and labor-saving foods for use at medical facilities within the representative's VISN.
              (1) The VISN Nutrition and Food Service representative must notify the Director, Nutrition and Food Service, VA Central Office, of the establishment or amendment of any VISN QPL.
              (2) To avoid unnecessary duplication within a VISN, for medical facilities using an applicable VISN QPL under paragraph (b) of this section, the VISN Nutrition and Food Service representative must coordinate and consolidate test results and recommendations.
              (b) Each medical facility may:
              (1) Use its VISN QPL; and
              (2) Test food of its choice, provided that the facility submits test results to the VISN Nutrition and Food Service representative.
              (c) The VISN representative must provide a copy of each approved VISN QPL to the following:
              (1) Each contracting office in the VISN.
              (2) The Director, Nutrition and Food Service, VA Central Office.
              (3) Upon request, the Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management, VA Central Office.

              Policy.
              (a) When VA receives information that another agency is pursuing a debarment or suspension identical to a VA action against the same contractor, the Debarment and Suspension (D&S) Committee will coordinate prospective action with the appropriate official of the other agency to establish a lead agency.
              (b) The D&S Committee will provide the designated lead agency with any information relevant to the action for consideration in the decision-making process.
              (c) The D&S Committee will maintain close coordination with the appropriate official through completion of a final debarment or suspension decision.

              809.406-1
              General.
              (a) As provided in FAR 9.406-1(c), authority to determine whether to continue business dealings between VA and a contractor debarred or proposed for debarment is delegated to the SPE and is further delegated to the DSPE.
              (b) For the purposes of FAR 9.406-1, the DSPE is the debarring official under the Federal Management Regulation at 41 CFR 102-117.295.

              (c) Additional factors that a debarring official should consider before arriving at a debarment decision include the following:
              
              (1) Whether the contractor had a mechanism, such as a hotline, by which employees could have reported suspected instances of improper conduct, and instructions in place that encouraged employees to make such reports.
              (2) Whether the contractor conducted periodic reviews of company business practices, procedures, policies, and internal controls for compliance with standards of conduct and the special requirements of Government contracting.
              (3) Whether the contractor conducted internal and external audits as appropriate.
              (4) Whether the contractor timely reported to appropriate Government officials any suspected or possible violations of law in connection with Government contracts or any other irregularities in connection with such contracts.
            
            
              809.406-2
              Cause for debarment.
              (a) Misrepresentation of VOSB or SDVOSB eligibility may result in action taken by VA officials to debar the business concern for a period not to exceed 5 years from contracting with VA as a prime contractor or a subcontractor.
              (b) Any deliberate violation of the limitation on subcontracting clause requirements for acquisitions under subpart 819.70 may result in action taken by VA officials to debar any service-disabled veteran-owned, veteran-owned small business concern or any large business concern involved in such action.

              809.406-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Any individual may submit a recommendation to debar a contractor to the DSPE. The recommendation to debar must be supported with evidence of a cause for debarment listed in FAR 9.406-2. When the DSPE receives a recommendation for debarment, he or she will refer the matter to the D&S Committee. If the reporting individual is a VA employee and the recommendation to debar is based on possible criminal or fraudulent activities, the VA employee must report the circumstances to the VA Office of Inspector General before making a recommendation to the DSPE.
              (b) When the D&S Committee finds evidence of a cause for debarment, as listed in FAR 9.406-2, with or without a recommendation, it will conduct a fact-finding and present facts to the debarring official.
              (c) If the debarring official finds a basis for proposing a contractor for debarment, the D&S Committee will prepare a notice of proposed debarment under FAR 9.406-3(c) for the signature of the debarring official. The signed notice of proposed debarment will be sent to the last known address of the contractor, the contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested. In the case of a business, the D&S Committee may send the notice of proposed debarment to any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture. The D&S Committee concurrently must post notice of proposed debarment to the General Services Administration Excluded Parties List System pending a debarment decision.
              (d) If VA does not receive a reply from the contractor within 45 calendar days of sending the notice of proposed debarment, the D&S Committee will prepare a recommendation and refer the case to the debarring official for a decision on whether or not to debar based on the information available.
              (e) If VA receives a reply from the contractor within 45 calendar days of sending the notice of proposed debarment, the D&S Committee must consider the information in the reply before the D&S Committee makes its recommendation to the debarring official.

              (f) The D&S Committee, upon the request of the contractor proposed for debarment, must, as soon as practicable, allow the contractor an opportunity to appear before the D&S Committee to present information or argument in person or through a representative. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. The proceeding will be conducted in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript. The D&S Committee shall prepare a report of the proceeding for the debarring official.
              
              (g) If the D&S Committee finds that the contractor's submission in opposition to the debarment raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment and the debarment action is not based on a conviction or civil judgment, then the D&S Committee shall submit to the debarring official the information establishing the dispute of material facts. If the debarring official agrees that there is a genuine dispute of material facts, the debarring official shall refer the dispute to a designee for resolution pursuant to 809.470.
              (h) If there are no disputes over material facts, the debarment action is based on a conviction or civil judgment, or all disputes over material facts have been resolved pursuant to 809.470, the debarring official will make a decision on the basis of all information available, including findings of facts and oral or written arguments presented or submitted to the D&S Committee by the contractor. The D&S Committee must update the status of the action on the General Services Administration Excluded Parties List System.
            
            
              809.406-4
              Period of debarment.
              (a) Except in an unusual circumstance, the period of debarment will not exceed 3 years. The debarring official will base the period of debarment on the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment.
              (b) The DSPE may remove a debarment, amend its scope, or reduce the period of debarment based on a D&S Committee recommendation if:
              (1) VA has debarred the contractor;
              (2) The action is indicated after the DSPE reviews documentary evidence submitted by or on behalf of the contractor setting forth the appropriate grounds for granting relief. Appropriate grounds include newly discovered material evidence, reversal of a conviction, bona fide change of ownership or management, elimination of the cause for which debarment was imposed, or any other appropriate grounds.

              809.407-1
              General.
              (a) As provided in FAR 9.407-1(d), authority to determine whether to continue business dealings between VA and a suspended contractor is delegated to the SPE and is further delegated to the DSPE.
              (b) For the purposes of FAR 9.407-1, the DSPE is the suspending official under the Federal Management Regulation at 41 CFR 102-117.295.
            
            
              809.407-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Any individual may submit a recommendation to suspend a contractor to the DSPE. The recommendation to suspend must be supported with evidence of a cause for suspension listed in FAR 9.407-2. When the DSPE receives a recommendation for suspension, he or she will refer the matter to the D&S Committee. If the reporting individual is a VA employee and the recommendation to suspend is based on possible criminal or fraudulent activities, the VA employee must report the circumstances to the VA Office of Inspector General before making a recommendation to the DSPE.
              (b) When the D&S Committee finds evidence of a cause for suspension, as listed in FAR 9.407-2, with or without a recommendation, it will conduct a fact-finding and present facts and recommendations to the suspending official.

              (c) If the suspending official finds a basis for suspending a contractor, the D&S Committee will prepare a notice of suspension under FAR 9.407-3(c) for the signature of the suspending official. The signed notice of suspension will be sent to the last known address of the contractor, the contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested. In the case of a business, the D&S Committee may send the notice of suspension to any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture. The D&S Committee concurrently must post notice of suspension to the General Services Administration Excluded Parties List System pending completion of investigation and any ensuing legal proceedings.
              
              (d) If VA receives a reply from the contractor within 45 calendar days of sending the notice of suspension, the D&S Committee must consider the information in the reply before the Committee makes further recommendations to the suspending official. The D&S Committee, upon the request of a suspended contractor, must, as soon as practicable, allow the contractor an opportunity to appear before the D&S Committee to present information or argument in person or through a representative. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. The proceeding will be conducted in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript. The D&S Committee shall prepare a report of the proceeding for the suspending official.
              (e) In actions not based on an indictment, if the D&S Committee finds that the contractor's submission in opposition to the suspension raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, the D&S Committee shall submit to the suspending official the information establishing the dispute of material facts. However, the D&S Committee must first coordinate any further proceeding regarding the facts in dispute with the Department of Justice or with a State prosecuting authority in a case involving a State jurisdiction. VA will take no further action to determine disputed material facts pursuant to this section or 809.470 if the Department of Justice or a State prosecuting authority advises VA that additional proceedings to make such a determination would prejudice Federal or State legal proceedings.
              (f) If the suspending official agrees that there is a genuine dispute of material facts, the suspending official shall refer the dispute to the designee for resolution pursuant to 809.470.
            
            
              809.470
              Fact-finding procedures.
              The provisions of this section constitute the procedures to be used to resolve genuine disputes of fact pursuant to 809.406-3 and 809.407-3 of this chapter. The DSPE shall appoint a designee to conduct the fact-finding. OGC shall represent VA at any fact-finding hearing and may present witnesses for VA and question any witnesses presented by the contractor. The hearings shall be conducted in Washington, DC. The proceedings before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts in dispute, as determined by the debarring or suspending official. The fact-finder will establish the date for the fact-finding hearing, normally to be held within 45 working days of the submission of the dispute.
              (a) The Government's representative and the contractor will have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issue. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative at the fact-finding hearing. The contractor may submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the agency presents.
              (b) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceedings and that any false testimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.
              (c) The proceedings shall be transcribed and a copy of the transcript shall be made available at cost to the contractor upon request, unless the contractor and the fact-finder, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a transcript.
              (d) The fact-finder shall determine the disputed fact(s) by a preponderance of the evidence. As required by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)(i), written findings of fact shall be prepared by the fact-finder. A copy of the findings of fact shall be provided to the debarring or suspending official, the Government's representative, and the contractor.

              809.503
              Waiver.
              The HCA is delegated authority to waive any general rule or procedure of FAR Subpart 9.5. As provided at FAR 9.503, this authority may not be redelegated.
            
            
              
              809.504
              Contracting officer responsibilities.
              (a) A contracting officer must determine whether awarding a contract will result in an actual or potential conflict of interest for the contractor.
              (1) The contracting officer will make a conflict of interest determination after reviewing information submitted by offerors, evaluating information gathered under FAR 9.506, and exercising his or her own judgment.
              (2) In evaluating possible organizational conflicts of interest, the contracting officer may obtain the advice of legal counsel and the assistance of technical specialists.
              (b) If the contracting officer determines that there is no way to avoid or mitigate an organizational conflict of interest arising from a contract award, the contracting officer may disqualify the offeror from award under FAR 9.504(e).
              (c) Even if awarding a contract will result in an organizational conflict of interest, the contracting officer may request a waiver from his or her HCA if awarding the contract is in the best interests of the Government.
              (1) Before granting a waiver request under this paragraph, the HCA must obtain the concurrence of OGC.
              (2) If the HCA grants a waiver request, the contracting officer may set contract terms and conditions to reduce any organizational conflict of interest to the greatest extent possible.
              (d) In any solicitation for the services addressed at FAR 9.502, the contracting officer must require that each offeror submits a statement with its offer disclosing all facts relevant to an existing or potential organizational conflict of interest involving the contractor or any subcontractor during the life of the contract (see 809.507-1(b) and 852.209-70).

              809.507-1
              Solicitation provisions.
              (a) While conflicts of interest may not presently exist, award of certain types of contracts may create potential future organizational conflicts of interest (see FAR 9.508 for examples). If a solicitation may create a potential future organizational conflict of interest, the contracting officer shall insert a provision in the solicitation imposing an appropriate restraint on the contractor's eligibility for award of contracts in the future. Under FAR 9.507-1, the restraint must be appropriate to the nature of the conflict and may exclude the contractor from award of one or more contracts in the future.
              (b) The clause at 852.209-70, Organizational conflicts of interest, must be included in any solicitation for the services addressed in FAR 9.502.

              (1) When the contracting officer determines that it will be to the Government's advantage to make an award on the basis of a summary bid, the IFB shall include the following statement in Part I—The Schedule, Section B:
              

              The award will be made on either the bid price for individual items or the summary bid price summary for all items, whichever results in the lowest price to the Government. Therefore, to assure proper evaluation of all bids, a bidder quoting a summary bid price must also quote a price on each individual item included in the summary bid price.
              

              (2) When a contracting officer determines that it will be to the Government's advantage to make an award by group or groups of items, the IFB shall include the following statement in Part I—The Schedule, Section B:
              
              Award shall be made on the basis of the bid price for each identified group of items. The individual price of each line item in the group does not have to be the lowest bid received for that item. This may apply when the items in the group or groups are readily available from sources to be solicited; and one of the following applies:
              (i) Furniture or fixtures are required for a single project and uniformity of design is desirable.
              (ii) The articles required will be assembled and used as a unit.

              (1) The contracting officer shall include the provision at 852.214-71, Restrictions on Alternate Item(s), in the invitation when VA will consider an alternate item only where acceptable bids on a desired item are not received or the bids do not satisfy the total requirement. (For construction projects, VA will consider for acceptance an alternate specified only as a part of the basic item.)
              (2) The contracting officer shall include the provision at 852.214-72, Alternate Item(s), in the invitation, when VA will consider an alternate item on an equal basis with the item specified. (For construction projects, VA will consider for acceptance an alternate specified only as a part of the basic item.)
              (3) In addition to either of the provisions referenced in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the contracting officer shall include the provision at 852.214-73, Alternate Packaging and Packing, in the invitation when bids will be allowed based on different packaging, unit designation, etc.
              (b) The contracting officer shall include the provision at 852.214-74, Marking of Bid Samples, in the invitation, along with the provision at FAR 52.214-20, Bid Samples, when the contracting officer determines that samples are necessary to the proper awarding of a contract.

              (g) Handling bid samples.
              
              (1) Samples from successful bids shall be retained for the period of contract performance.
              (2) If the contracting officer anticipates a claim regarding the contract, the contracting officer shall require that the bid samples be retained until the claim is resolved. If there are no outstanding claims regarding the contract, the contracting officer may authorize disposal of the samples at the end of the contract term in accordance with the bidder's instructions.
              (3) The contracting officer shall require that samples from unsuccessful bids be retained until award. After award, these samples may be disposed of in accordance with the bidder's instructions.

              (2) Use past performance in meeting SDVOSB subcontracting goals as a non-price evaluation factor in selecting offers for award;
              (3) Use the proposed inclusion of SDVOSBs or VOSBs as subcontractors as an evaluation factor when competitively negotiating the award of contracts or task or delivery orders; and
              (4) Use participation in VA's Mentor-Protégé Program as an evaluation factor when competitively negotiating the award of contracts or task or delivery orders.
              (b) If an offeror proposes to use an SDVOSB or VOSB subcontractor in accordance with 852.215-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors, the contracting officer shall ensure that the offeror, if awarded the contract, actually does use the proposed subcontractor or another SDVOSB or VOSB subcontractor for that subcontract or for work of similar value.

              Except as provided in 815.370-4, if only one offer is received when competitive procedures were used and the solicitation allowed fewer than 30 days for receipt of proposals, the contracting officer should—
              (a) Consult with the requiring activity as to whether the requirements document should be revised in order to promote more competition (see FAR 6.502(b) and 11.002); and
              (b) Consider re-soliciting, allowing an additional period of at least 30 days for receipt of proposals.

              (a) If there was “reasonable expectation that two or more offerors, competing independently, would submit priced offers” but only one offer is received, this circumstance does not constitute adequate price competition unless an official at a level above the contracting officer approves the determination that the price is reasonable (see FAR 15.403-1(c)(1)(ii)).
              (b) Except as provided in 815.370-4(a), if only one offer is received when competitive procedures were used and the solicitation allowed at least 30 days for receipt of proposals (unless the 30-day requirement is not applicable in accordance with 815.370-4(a)(3)), the contracting officer shall—
              (1) Determine through cost or price analysis that the offered price is fair and reasonable and that adequate price competition exists (with approval of the determination at a level above the contracting officer) or another exception to the requirement for certified cost or pricing data applies (see FAR 15.403-1(c) and 15.403-4). In these circumstances, no further cost or pricing data is required; or
              (2)(i) Obtain from the offeror cost or pricing data necessary to determine a fair and reasonable price and comply with the requirement for certified cost or pricing data at FAR 15.403-4. For acquisitions that exceed the cost or pricing data threshold, if no exception at FAR 15.403-1(b) applies, the cost or pricing data shall be certified; and

              (ii) Enter into negotiations with the offeror as necessary to establish a fair and reasonable price. The negotiated price should not exceed the offered price.

              (1) Acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold;
              (2) Acquisitions in support of emergency, humanitarian or peacekeeping operations, or to facilitate defense against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack; or to support response to an emergency or major disaster;

              (b) The applicability of an exception in paragraph (a) of this section does not eliminate the need for the contracting officer to ensure adequate time for competition is allotted or that the price is fair and reasonable.

              Proposal analysis techniques.
              (a) Contracting officers are responsible for the technical and administrative sufficiency of the contracts they enter into. Contracting officers must ensure that contracts undergo all applicable legal and technical reviews. (See 801.602-70.)
              (b) Contracting officers determine the level of technical analyses necessary for initial and revised pricing of all negotiated prime contracts, including subcontract pricing under them, and contract modifications. Contracting officers must request technical analyses of the proposals from the appropriate technical personnel. The technical analyses must address, as a minimum, the items set forth in FAR 15.404-1(e)(2).
              (c) The contracting officer must document the results of such analyses in the contract file and make the results available to the auditor performing the pre-award audit.
            
            
              815.404-2
              Information to support proposal analysis.
              In evaluating start-up and other non-recurring costs, the contracting officer must determine the extent to which these costs are included in the proposed price and the intent to absorb or recover the costs in any future noncompetitive procurement or other pricing action. The contracting officer must ensure, with the assistance of the Assistant Inspector General for Policy, Planning, and Resources, as required or considered necessary, that VA will not pay the costs twice. For example, the cost of equipment that the Government pays for through a setup or connection agreement must not be included in depreciation cost of a subsequently negotiated agreement.

              815.606
              Department procedures.
              (a) The VA contact point will do the following:
              (1) Determine the nature of the potential proposal and which technical/professional disciplines within VA to consult to determine the need for the proposal and the likelihood that a formal proposal would earn favorable review.
              (2) In consultation with such technical/professional offices, the VA contact point will furnish the potential offeror the information specified in FAR 15.604 and any other information that might be of assistance to the potential offeror.
              (b) The contact point will maintain a record of advance guidance provided and the disposition/recommendation regarding the potential offer.
              (c) The contact point will review the unsolicited proposal and ensure that it is complete as prescribed in FAR 15.605. If required information is not submitted, the contact point will:
              (1) Determine if FAR 15.604 requires advance guidance;
              (2) Determine whether a comprehensive evaluation prescribed by FAR 15.606-2 is appropriate and, if so, request that the offeror provide the necessary information; and,
              (3) Establish an estimated due date for completion of the review process.
            
            
              815.606-1
              Receipt and initial review.
              (a) When the VA contact point determines a proposal warrants a comprehensive evaluation (i.e., the proposal complies with the requirements in FAR 15.606-1(a) and is related to VA's mission), the contact point must contact the offeror to ensure that all data that should be restricted in accordance with FAR 15.609 has been identified.
              (b) The contact point must maintain a log of all unsolicited proposals to be evaluated. The log must indicate the following:
              (1) The date the proposal was received.
              (2) The date that the unsolicited proposal was determined to warrant a comprehensive evaluation.
              (3) A description of the proposal.
              (4) The offices requested to evaluate the proposal and the date the offices are requested to return their evaluations.
              (5) The date the reviewing offices finalize their respective evaluations.
              (6) The final disposition of the proposal.
              (c) The contact point must advise each office assigned responsibility for reviewing an unsolicited proposal of the need to evaluate the proposal against the criteria set forth in FAR 15.607(a)(1) through (4). If the reviewers determine that the proposal fails to meet any of the criteria, the contact point must be advised. The contact point must return the proposal to the offeror, citing the reasons therefore.
              (d) The contact point must obtain approval of the DSPE (049A5) before the contact point, if warranted as a contracting officer, or an appropriate contracting officer begins negotiation on proposals. The contact point must provide the DSPE (049A5) all necessary documentation supporting the noncompetitive negotiation, including any justification and approval required by FAR Subpart 6.3 and the results of any synopsis required by FAR Subpart 5.2. The DSPE (049A5) will consult the appropriate VA Central Office program official(s) and return the final decision to the contact point.

              Contract clauses.
              (e) The contracting officer shall, when contracting by negotiation, use the following clauses.
              (1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 852.216-71, “Economic Price Adjustment of Contract Price(s) Based on a Price Index,” in solicitations and firm fixed price contracts, subject to FAR 16.203-4(d)(1) and when changes to a price index will be used to calculate corresponding changes to the total contract price or unit prices of the contract.
              (i) Exceptions:
              (A) Do not use this clause when changes to the price index will apply to only a component part of the contract price.
              (B) Do not publish or include the footnotes in the solicitation, they are only included herein to provide guidance to contracting officers.
              (2) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 852.216-72, “Proportional Economic Price Adjustment of Contract Price(s) Based on a Price Index,” in solicitations and firm fixed price contracts, and subject to FAR 16.203-4(d)(1) when changes to an industry price index shall be used to calculate changes to only a portion of the contract price or the unit prices of the contract.
              (i) Exceptions:

              (A) The clause should not be used when a change in the index price will be applied directly and totally to the contract price or the unit prices, i.e., when the Consumer Price Index is used to calculate changes and a 5% increase in the CPI would result in a 5% increase in the total contract price of the unit prices.
              (B) Do not publish or include the footnotes in the solicitation, as they are only provided for guidance to the contracting officer.
              (3) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 852.216-73, “Economic Price Adjustment—State Nursing Home Care for Veterans,” in solicitations and firm fixed price contracts subject to FAR 16.203-4(d)(1) and the following circumstance: When changes to the Medicaid rate, as authorized by the State Medicaid Agency (SMA), shall be used to calculate corresponding changes in the total contract price or the per diem prices of the agreement or contract.
              (4) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 852.216-74, “Economic Price Adjustment—Medicaid Labor Rates,” in solicitations and firm fixed price contracts when the conditions specified in FAR 16.203-4(c)(1) apply. The clause is modifiable by increasing the 10-percent maximum limit on aggregate increases specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, upon the approval by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) or designee.

              (5) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 852.216-75, “Economic Price Adjustment—Fuel Surcharge,” in solicitations and firm fixed price contracts when contracting by negotiation is subject to changes in the cost of fuel increases. The clause is subject to the conditions at FAR 16.203-4(d)(1).
              (f) The contracting officer shall follow procedures as prescribed in FAR 16.203-4(c) and 38 CFR 51.41(b)(1) for EPA fixed price contracts based on Medicaid rates. These procedures shall be used when contracting by negotiation between the VA and the State Veteran Home for making payments under contracts for nursing home care for Veterans.

              Consignment agreements shall only be established under a contract and by a contracting officer.

              817.7001
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              (a) Contract action includes:
              (1) Contracts and contract modifications for supplies or services.
              (2) Task orders and delivery orders.

              (3) It does not include change orders, administrative changes, funding modifications, or any other contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the contract, e.g., engineering change proposals and value engineering change proposals.
              (b) Definitization means the agreement on, or determination of, contract terms, specifications, and price, which converts the undefinitized contract action to a definitive contract.
              (c) Definitization proposal means a proposal containing sufficient data for the VA to do complete and meaningful analyses and audits of the—
              (1) Data in the proposal; and
              (2) Any other data that the contracting officer has determined VA needs to review in connection with the contract.
              (d) Undefinitized contract action means any contract action for which the contract terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon before performance is begun under the action. Examples are letter contracts and orders under basic ordering agreements for which the final price has not been agreed upon before performance has begun.

              (a) Be used only when—
              (1) The negotiation of a definitive contract action is not possible in sufficient time to meet the Government's requirements; and
              (2) The Government's interest demands that the contractor be given a binding commitment so that contract performance can begin immediately.
              (b) Be as complete and definite as practicable.
            
            
              817.7004

              817.7004-3
              Definitization schedule.
              (a) UCAs shall contain definitization schedules that provide for definitization by the earlier of—
              (1) The date that is 180 days after issuance of the action (this date may be extended but may not exceed the date that is 180 days after the contractor submits a definitization proposal); or

              General policy.
              The Secretary shall establish goals for each fiscal year for participation in Department contracts by SDVOSBs and VOSBs. In order to establish contracting priority for veteran-owned and controlled small businesses in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 8128, the Secretary may decrease other status-specific small business goals set forth by section 15(g)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(g)(1)) upon consultation with the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).

              Encouraging small business participation in acquisitions.

              Contracting officers may negotiate payment terms of less than 30 calendar days to encourage small business participation. A period of less than 7 days may not be prescribed (see FAR 32.908(c)(2)). The contracting officer and the local fiscal officer must be in agreement on the negotiated payment terms before awarding the contract.
            
            
              819.202-5
              Data collection and reporting requirements.
              (a) Administration heads, staff office directors, and HCAs must, in addition to the responsibilities designated in FAR 19.202-5, cooperate with OSDBU in formulating specific small business program goals and providing other data necessary for goal assessment.
              (b) Each VA acquisition activity shall establish goals for the expenditure of funds with preferred businesses within their projected annual budget. OSDBU is responsible for Department-wide goals and accomplishments and will approve or adjust each acquisition activity's goals.
              (c) A Procurement Preference Program Goals Report (Report Control Symbol 00-0427) shall be submitted annually by each acquisition activity to reach OSDBU by November 1. Each report shall contain total expenditure estimates and goals for the current fiscal year and explanations of the methods utilized to arrive at each proposed goal. Anticipated problems in the attainment of the proposed goal in any category shall also be identified. This information will be used in negotiating the Department goals with the Small Business Administration (SBA).
              (d) As an addendum to the report, each acquisition activity shall provide a narrative explaining the reason(s) for any shortfall(s) in the achievement of any previous fiscal year goal category.
              (e) Upon review by OSDBU of the proposed goals, each acquisition activity will be notified of the acceptance of goals as submitted, or of any deficiencies. If the goals are not acceptable, the acquisition activity will be requested to submit further written justification for the goals submitted. Based on documents submitted, OSDBU will make a final determination on the goal assignment.
              (f) Accomplishment of goals will be determined by OSDBU from data reported by acquisition activities into the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG).

              (d) Review class set-asides, established in accordance with criteria in FAR 19.503, at least annually to determine whether items or services procured under a unilateral or joint set-aside should be modified or withdrawn.
              (e) Maintain updated lists of acquisitions reserved for small business on a class basis.
              (f) If the acquisition activity is assigned to an SBA Procurement Center Representative, assure that the representative is provided logistical support, cooperation, and access to all reasonably obtainable contract information directly pertinent to the SBA Procurement Center Representative's official duties.

            Subpart 819.3—Determination of Small Business Status for Small Business Programs
            
              819.307
              SDVOSB/VOSB Small Business Status Protests.
              (a) All protests relating to whether a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) is a “small” business for the purposes of any Federal program are subject to 13 CFR part 121 and must be filed in accordance with that part. SDVOSB and VOSB status shall be determined in accordance with 38 CFR part 74.
              (b) A contracting officer or an interested party may protest the apparently successful offeror's SDVOSB or VOSB status. “Interested party” for the purpose of filing a status protest is an actual offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.
              (c) All status protests shall be in writing and shall state all specific grounds for the protest. Assertions that a protested concern is not an SDVOSB or VOSB concern, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, are insufficient. An interested party must submit its status protest to the contracting officer by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening (in sealed bid acquisitions) or by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparently successful offeror (in negotiated acquisitions). An interested party must deliver their protest in person, by electronic mail, by facsimile, by express delivery service, or by the U.S. Postal Service within the applicable time period to the contracting officer. Any status protest received after these time limits is untimely. Any status protest received prior to bid opening or notification of intended award, whichever applies, is premature and shall be returned to the protester. Except for premature status protests, the contracting officer must forward to the Director, Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE), any status protest received.
              (d) The Director, CVE, will notify the protester and the contracting officer of the date the status protest was received by CVE and whether the status protest will be processed or dismissed for lack of timeliness or specificity.
              (e) The Director, CVE, will determine the SDVOSB or VOSB status of the protested concern based upon the totality of circumstances within 21 business days after receipt of the status protest. If the Director, CVE, does not contact the contracting officer within 21 business days, the contracting officer may award the contract to the apparently successful offeror, unless the contracting officer has granted the Director, CVE, an extension. The contracting officer may award the contract after receipt of a status protest if the contracting officer determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest. The contracting officer shall document this determination for the contract file.

              (f) A denial decision by the Director, CVE, that is based on the failure to meet any service-disabled Veteran or Veteran criterion as defined in 38 CFR 74.1 is not subject to an appeal to the Executive Director, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), and is a final decision.
              (g) The Director, CVE, will notify the contracting officer, the protester, and the protested concern of its determination. The determination is effective immediately and is final unless overturned on appeal by the Executive Director, OSDBU. The determination may be sent by mail, commercial carrier, facsimile transmission, or other electronic means.
              (h) If the Director, CVE, sustains an SDVOSB or VOSB status protest and the contract has already been awarded, then the awarded contract shall be deemed void ab initio and the contracting officer shall rescind the contract and award the contract to the next SDVOSB or VOSB in line for the award. The ineligible SDVOSB or VOSB concern shall not be permitted to submit another offer as a SDVOSB or VOSB on a future SDVOSB or VOSB procurement under this part, unless it successfully appeals the determination of the Director, CVE, to the Executive Director, OSDBU, or unless it applies for and receives verified SDVOSB or VOSB status in accordance with 38 CFR part 74.
              (i) Except as provided in subsection (f), the protestor or the protested SDVOSB or VOSB concern may file an appeal of the status protest determination with the Executive Director, OSDBU. The Executive Director must receive the appeal no later than 5 business days after the date of receipt of the status protest determination. The Executive Director will dismiss any appeal received after the 5-day period. “Filing” means a document is received by the Executive Director by 5:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on that day. Documents may be filed by hand delivery, mail, commercial carrier, or facsimile transmission. Hand delivery and other means of delivery may not be practicable during certain periods due to, for example, security concerns or equipment failures. The filing party bears the risk that the delivery method chosen will not result in timely receipt by the Executive Director, OSDBU. Submit appeals to: Executive Director, OSDBU (00VE), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420.
              (j) The appeal must be in writing. The appeal must identify the status protest determination being appealed and must set forth a full and specific statement as to why the decision was based on clear error of fact or law.
              (k) The party appealing the determination must provide notice of the appeal to the contracting officer. The Executive Director will decide all appeals under this subpart solely on a review of the evidence in the written protest file, arguments made in the appeal petition and response(s) filed thereto.
              (l) The Executive Director will make a decision within 10 business days of the receipt of the appeal, if practicable, and will base the decision only on the information and documentation in the protest record as supplemented by the appeal. The Executive Director will provide a copy of the decision to the contracting officer and the protested SDVOSB or VOSB concern. The Executive Director's decision, if received before the award, will apply to the pending acquisition. If the Executive Director decides in favor of the appealing party and the decision is received after the award, the contracting officer may terminate the contract or not exercise the next option. The Executive Director's decision is the final decision. The decision may be sent by mail, commercial carrier, facsimile transmission, or other electronic means.

Except as authorized by 813.106, 819.7007 and 819.7008, the contracting officer shall set-aside an acquisition for competition restricted to SDVOSB concerns upon a reasonable expectation that,
              (1) Offers will be received from two or more eligible SDVOSB concerns; and
              (2) Award will be made at a fair and reasonable price.
              (b) When conducting SDVOSB set-asides, the contracting officer shall ensure:

              (c) If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer at a fair and reasonable price from an eligible SDVOSB concern in response to a SDVOSB set-aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that concern. If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from eligible SDVOSB concerns, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for VOSB competition, if appropriate.

              (a) The contracting officer shall consider SDVOSB set-asides before considering VOSB set-asides. Except as authorized by 813.106, 819.7007 and 819.7008, the contracting officer shall set aside an acquisition for competition restricted to VOSB concerns upon a reasonable expectation that:

            Subpart 819.71—VA Mentor-Protégé Program
            
              Source:
              74 FR 64633, Dec. 8, 2009, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              819.7101
              Purpose.
              The VA Mentor-Protégé Program is designed to assist service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) in enhancing their capabilities to perform contracts and subcontracts for VA. The Mentor-Protégé Program is also designed to improve the performance of VA contractors and subcontractors by providing developmental assistance to protégé entities, fostering the establishment of long-term business relationships between SDVOSBs, VOSBs and prime contractors, and increasing the overall number of SDVOSBs and VOSBs that receive VA contract and subcontract awards. A firm's status as a protégé under a VA contract shall not have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other prime contracts or subcontracts.
            
            
              819.7102
              Definitions.
              (a) A Mentor is a contractor that elects to promote and develop SDVOSBs and/or VOSBs by providing developmental assistance designed to enhance the business success of the protégé. A mentor may be a large or small business concern.
              (b) OSDBU is the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization. This is the VA office responsible for administering, implementing and coordinating the Department's small business programs, including the Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (c) Program refers to the VA Mentor-Protégé Program as described in this Subpart.
              (d) Protégé means a SDVOSB or VOSB, as defined in 802.101, which meets federal small business size standards in its primary NAICS code and which is the recipient of developmental assistance pursuant to a Mentor-Protégé agreement.
            
            
              
              819.7103
              Non-affiliation.
              A Protégé firm will not be considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely on the basis that the protégé firm is receiving developmental assistance from the mentor firm under VA's Mentor-Protégé Program. The determination of affiliation is a function of the SBA.
            
            
              819.7104
              General policy.

              (a) To be eligible, mentors and protégés must not be listed on the Excluded Parties List System, located at http://www.epls.gov. Mentors will provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of protégés to perform as prime contractors and/or subcontractors.
              (b) VA reserves the right to limit the number of participants in the program in order to ensure its effective management of the Mentor-Protégé Program.
            
            
              819.7105
              Incentives for prime contractor participation.
              (a) Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(e), VA is authorized to provide appropriate incentives to encourage subcontracting opportunities for small business consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. This authority is limited to negotiated procurements. FAR 19.202-1 provides additional guidance.
              (b) Costs incurred by a mentor to provide developmental assistance, as described in 819.7110 to fulfill the terms of their agreement(s) with a protégé firm(s), are not reimbursable as a direct cost under a VA contract. If VA is the mentor's responsible audit agency under FAR 42.703-1, VA will consider these costs in determining indirect cost rates. If VA is not the responsible audit agency, mentors are encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with their responsible audit agency on the treatment of such costs when determining indirect cost rates.
              (c) In addition to subparagraph (b) of this section, contracting officers shall give mentors evaluation credit under 852.219-52, Evaluation Factor for Participation in the VA Mentor-Protégé Program, considerations for subcontracts awarded pursuant to their Mentor-Protégé Agreements and their subcontracting plans. Therefore:
              (1) Contracting officers may evaluate subcontracting plans containing mentor-protégé arrangements more favorably than subcontracting plans without Mentor-Protégé Agreements.
              (2) Contracting officers may assess the prime contractor's compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in evaluating past performance under FAR 15.305(a)(2)(v) and determining contractor responsibility 19.705-5(a)(1).
              (d) OSDBU Mentoring Award. A non-monetary award will be presented annually to the mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support to a protégé. The Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the OSDBU Director.
              (e) OSDBU Mentor-Protégé Annual Conference. At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protégé Program, mentor firms will be invited to brief contracting officers, program leaders, office directors and other guests on program progress.
            
            
              819.7106
              Eligibility of Mentor and Protégé firms.
              Eligible business entities approved as mentors may enter into agreements (hereafter referred to as “Mentor-Protégé Agreement” or “Agreement” and explained in 819.7108) with eligible protégés. Mentors provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of protégés to perform as contractors and/or subcontractors. Eligible small business entities capable of providing developmental assistance may be approved as mentors. Protégés may participate in the program in pursuit of a prime contract or as subcontractors under the mentor's prime contract with VA, but are not required to be a subcontractor to a VA prime contractor or be a VA prime contractor.
              (a) Eligibility. A Mentor:
              (1) May be either a large or small business entity and either a prime contractor or subcontractor;
              (2) Must be able to provide developmental assistance that will enhance the ability of Protégés to perform as prime contractors or subcontractors; and

              (3) Will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with entities with which it has established business relationships.
              (b) Eligibility. A Protégé:
              (1) Must be a SDVOSB or VOSB as defined in 802.101;
              (2) Must meet the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code that the Mentor prime contractor believes best describes the product or service being acquired by the subcontract; and
              (c) Protégés may have multiple mentors. Protégés participating in mentor-protégé programs in addition to VA's Program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of mentoring activity so that results of VA's Program can be reported separately from any other agency program.
              (d) A protégé firm shall self-represent to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Mentors shall confirm eligibility by documenting the verified status of the protégé in the VetBiz.gov VIP database. Protégés must maintain verified status throughout the term of the Mentor-Protégé Agreement. Failure to do so shall result in cancellation of the Agreement.
            
            
              819.7107
              Selection of Protégé firms.
              (a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting protégé firms. Mentors are encouraged to select from a broad base of SDVOSB or VOSB firms whose core competencies support VA's mission; and choose SDVOSB and/or VOSB protégés in addition to firms with whom they have established business relationships.
              (b) Mentors may have multiple protégés. However, to preserve the integrity of the Program and assure the quality of developmental assistance provided to protégés, VA reserves the right to limit the total number of protégés participating under each mentor firm for the Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (c) The selection of protégé firms by mentor firms may not be protested, except that any protest regarding the size or eligibility status of an entity selected by a mentor shall be handled in accordance with the FAR and SBA regulations.
            
            
              819.7108
              Application process.
              (a) Firms interested in becoming approved mentor-protégé participants must submit a joint written VA Mentor-Protégé Agreement to the VA OSDBU for review and approval. The proposed Mentor-Protégé Agreement will be evaluated on the extent to which the mentor plans to provide developmental assistance. Evaluations will consider the nature and extent of technical and managerial support as well as any proposed financial assistance in the form of equity investment, loans, joint-venture, and traditional subcontracting support.
              (b) The Mentor-Protégé Agreement must contain:
              (1) Names, addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses (if available) of the mentor and protégé firm(s) and a point of contact for both mentor and protégé who will oversee the agreement;
              (2) A statement from the protégé firm that the firm is currently eligible as a SDVOSB or VOSB to participate in VA's Mentor-Protégé Program;
              (3) A description of the mentor's ability to provide developmental assistance to the protégé and the type of developmental assistance that will be provided, to include a description of the types and dollar amounts of subcontract work, if any, that may be awarded to the protégé firm;
              (4) Duration of the Agreement, including rights and responsibilities of both parties (mentor and protégé), with bi-annual reviews;
              (5) Termination procedures, including procedures for the parties' voluntary withdrawal from the Program. The Agreement shall require the mentor or the protégé to notify the other firm and VA OSDBU in writing at least 30 days in advance of its intent to voluntarily terminate the Agreement;
              (6) A schedule with milestones for providing assistance;
              (7) Criteria for evaluation of the protégé's developmental success;

              (8) A plan addressing how the mentor will increase the quality of the protégé firm's technical capabilities and contracting and subcontracting opportunities;
              
              (9) An estimate of the total cost of the planned mentoring assistance to be provided to the Protégé;
              (10) An agreement by both parties to comply with the reporting requirements of 819.7113;
              (11) A plan for accomplishing unfinished work should the Agreement be voluntarily cancelled;
              (12) Other terms and conditions, as appropriate; and
              (13) Signatures and date(s).
              (c) The Agreement defines the relationship between the mentor and the protégé firms only. The Agreement does not create any privity of contract between the mentor and VA or the protégé and VA.
            
            
              819.7109
              VA review of application.
              (a) VA OSDBU will review the information to establish the mentor and protégé eligibility and to ensure that the information that is in VAAR 819.7108 is included. If the application relates to a specific contract, then OSDBU will consult with the responsible contracting officer on the adequacy of the proposed Agreement, as appropriate. OSDBU will complete its review no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the application or after consultation with the contracting officer, whichever is later. There is no charge to apply for the Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (b) After OSDBU completes its review and provides written approval, the mentor may execute the Agreement and implement the developmental assistance as provided under the Agreement. OSDBU will post a copy of the Mentor-Protégé Agreements to a VA Web site to be accessible to VA contracting officers for review for any VA contracts affected by the Agreement.
              (c) If the application is disapproved, the mentor may provide additional information for reconsideration. OSDBU will complete review of any supplemental material no later than 30 days after its receipt. Upon finding deficiencies that VA considers correctable, OSDBU will notify the mentor and protégé and request correction of deficiencies to be provided within 15 days.
            
            
              819.7110

              Obligations under the Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (a) A mentor or protégé may voluntarily withdraw from the Program. However, in no event shall such withdrawal impact the contractual requirements under any prime contract with VA.
              (b) Mentors and protégés shall submit reports to VA OSDBU in accordance with 819.7113.
            
            
              819.7112
              Internal controls.
              (a) OSDBU will oversee the Program and will work cooperatively with relevant contracting officers to achieve Program objectives. OSDBU will establish internal controls as checks and balances applicable to the Program. These controls will include:

              (4) Limiting the number of participants in the Mentor-Protégé Program within a reporting period, in order to insure the effective management of the Program.
              (b) VA may rescind approval of an existing Mentor-Protégé Agreement if it determines that such action is in VA's best interest. The rescission shall be in writing and sent to the mentor and protégé after approval by the OSDBU Director. Rescission of an Agreement does not change the terms of any subcontract between the mentor and the protégé.

              Variations, tolerances, and exemptions.

              For contracts providing nursing home care for veterans, the Secretary of Labor has allowed a variation to the requirements of Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards (the statute) (40 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.) regarding the payment of overtime (see 29 CFR 5.15(d)(2)).

              (a) Public interest. When a contracting officer believes that a determination that domestic preference would be inconsistent with the public interest is necessary under FAR 25.103(a), the contracting officer must submit the request for determination to the DSPE for submission to the SPE, who will forward the request to the Secretary for approval. The request for determination must contain all the facts and other pertinent information upon which a determination may be made.

              (ii) Forward a copy of the determination, along with supporting documentation, to the DSPE.
              (2) If the HCA believes that the non-availability of an article is likely to affect future acquisitions, include a recommendation that a copy of the determination and supporting documentation be forwarded to the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) for possible addition to the list of non-available articles in FAR 25.104.

              When the contracting officer determines it to be in the best interest of the Government, the contracting officer may request an exception to the requirements of FAR 25.601 from the Secretary through the DSPE and the SPE. Each such request must be fully justified and include all pertinent facts, as provided in FAR 25.602(b).

              828.7000
              Scope of subpart.
              (a) As used in this subpart, the term “contractor” includes subcontractors of any tier under a contract containing an indemnification provision under 38 U.S.C. 7317.
              (b) This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures concerning indemnification of contractors performing contracts involving medical research or research and development that involve risks of an unusually hazardous nature, as authorized by 38 U.S.C. 7317.
              (c) The authority to indemnify the contractor under this subpart does not create any rights to third parties that do not exist by law.
            
            
              828.7001
              Extent of indemnification.
              (a) A contract for medical research or development authorized by 38 U.S.C. 7303, may provide that the Government will indemnify the contractor against losses or liability specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section if all of the following apply:
              (1) The contract work involves a risk of an unusually hazardous nature.
              (2) The losses or liability arise out of the direct performance of the contract.
              (3) The losses or liability are not covered by the financial protection required under 828.7002.
              (b) The Government may indemnify a contractor for liability (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) to third persons for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property from a risk that the contract defines as unusually hazardous. The indemnification will not cover liability under State or Federal worker's injury compensation laws to employees of the contractor who are both:
              (1) Employed at the site of the contract work; and
              (2) Working on the contract for which indemnification is granted.
              (c) The Government may indemnify the contractor for loss of or damage to property of the contractor from a risk that the contract defines as unusually hazardous.
              (d) A contract that provides for indemnification in accordance with this subpart must also require that:
              (1) The contractor must notify the contracting officer of any claim or suit against the contractor for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and
              (2) The Government may choose to control or assist in the defense of any suit or claim for which indemnification is provided in the contract. (38 U.S.C. 7317)
            
            
              828.7002
              Financial protection.
              (a) A contractor shall have and maintain an amount of financial protection to cover liability to third persons and loss of or damage to the contractor's property that meets one of the following:
              (1) The maximum amount of insurance available from private sources; or
              (2) A lesser amount that the Secretary establishes after taking into consideration the cost and terms of private insurance.
              (b) Financial protection may include private insurance, private contractual indemnities, self-insurance, other proof of financial responsibility, or a combination that provides the maximum amount required. If a contractor elects to self-insure, the contractor must provide the contracting officer, before award, proof of financial responsibility up to the maximum amount required. (38 U.S.C. 7317)
            
            
              828.7003
              Indemnification clause.
              The contracting officer shall include the clause, 852.228-72, “Indemnification of Contractor—Hazardous Research Projects” in contracts and solicitations that indemnify a contractor for liability (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) to third person for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property from a risk that the contract defines in the performance work statement, the statement of work, or the statement of objectives as unusually hazardous.

              Tax exemptions for alcohol products.
              (a) General. (1) Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5214(a)(2) and 26 U.S.C. 5271, VA may purchase spirits using a tax exemption as provided by Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulations (see 27 CFR parts 1 through 39). As stated in 27 CFR 19.426, agencies of the United States Government that wish to obtain either specially denatured spirits or spirits free of tax for nonbeverage purposes must apply for and receive a permit on form TTB F 5150.33 or must have a previously issued permit on ATF Form 1444.
              (2) When purchasing spirits under a tax exemption, the contracting officer shall indicate in the contract document the basis for the exemption and make a copy of the permit available to the contractor. Upon receipt of the spirits, the contractor shall return the permit to the contracting officer unless future orders are anticipated or as directed by the contracting officer.
              (3) Department of Veterans Affairs activities that require spirits free of tax for beverage purposes under 26 U.S.C. 7510 must provide a proper purchase order signed by the head of the agency or an authorized designee.
              (b) Specially denatured spirits or spirits free of tax for nonbeverage purposes. Contracting officers may make purchases of excise tax-free spirits, including denatured alcohol and specially denatured alcohol only from qualified distillery plants or bonded dealers.
              (1) Permits previously issued on Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) Form 1444, Tax-Free Spirits for Use of United States, remain valid until surrendered or cancelled.
              (2) A copy of the current ATF Form 1444 or TTB Form 5150.33 shall be made available to the supplier with the initial order. The permit number only needs to be referenced on any future orders with the same supplier.
              (c) Wine. No tax exemption form or ATF/TTB permit is required for the tax-free procurement of wine from bonded wine premises. The purchase order must show the kind, quantity, and alcohol content of the wine and must state the purpose for which wine is to be used (see 27 CFR 24.293). An extra copy of a properly executed purchase order may be furnished to the bonded wine premises from which wine is purchased to facilitate record keeping. The order must be signed by the head of the contracting activity or their designee.

              831.7000
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart contains general cost principles and procedures for the determination and allowance of costs or negotiation of prices under cost reimbursement or fixed-price contracts for providing vocational rehabilitation, education, and training to eligible Veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, (referred to as a “chapter 31 program”). This subpart applies to contracts with educational institutions as well as to contracts with commercial and non-profit organizations.
            
            
              831.7000-1
              Definitions.
              
                Chapter 31 refers to the vocational rehabilitation and employment (VR&E) program that provides training and rehabilitation for Veterans with service-connected disabilities under chapter 31 of Title 38 U.S.C.
              
                Consumable instructional supplies means those supplies which are required for instruction in the classroom, shop school, and laboratory of an educational institution, which are consumed, destroyed, or expended by either the student, instructor or both in the process of use, and which have to be replaced at frequent intervals without adding to the value of the institution's physical property.
              
                Similarly circumstanced non-Veteran student means a student in equal or like situations as a person who is neither receiving educational or training benefits under chapter 31 or chapter 33 of Title 38 U.S.C. or the savings provisions of section 12(a) of Public Law 85-857, nor having all or any part of tuition fees or other charges paid by the educational institution.
              
                Work adjustment training means a specialized structure program that is facility or community based and designated to assist an individual in acquiring or improving work skills, work behaviors, work tolerance, interpersonal skills or work ethics.

              831.7001-1
              Tuition.
              (a) Tuition and enrollment fees shall be paid at the institution's customary amount that—
              (1) Does not exceed the tuition charged to similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students; and
              (2) Is equal to the lowest price offered or published for the entire course, semester, quarter, or term.
              (b) The cost of the Veteran student's tuition and fees under a contract shall be offset by—
              (1) Any amount of tuition and fees that are waived by a State or other government authority; or
              (2) Any amounts the Veteran student receives from a fellowship, scholarship, grant-in-aid, assistantship, or similar award that limits its use to payment of tuition, fees, or other charges that VA normally pays as part of a chapter 31 program.
              (c) VA will not pay tuition or incidental fees to institutions or establishments furnishing apprentice or on-the-job training. VA may elect to pay charges or expenses that fall into either of the following categories:

              (1) Charges customarily made by a nonprofit workshop or similar establishment for providing work adjustment training to similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students even if the trainee receives an incentive wage as part of the training.
              (2) Training expenses incurred by an employer who provides on-the-job training following rehabilitation to the point of employability when VA determines that the additional training is necessary.
            
            
              831.7001-2
              Special services or courses.
              Special services or courses are those services or courses that VA requests that are supplementary to those the institution customarily provides for similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students, and that the contracting officer considers them to be necessary for the rehabilitation of the trainee. VA will negotiate the costs/prices of special services or courses prior to ordering them.
            
            
              831.7001-3
              Books, supplies, and equipment required to be personally owned.
              (a) Reimbursement for books, supplies, and equipment. VA will provide reimbursement for books, equipment, or other supplies of the same variety, quality, or amount that all students taking the same course or courses are customarily required to own personally. VA will provide reimbursement for items that the institution does not specifically require for pursuit of the course if VA determines that such items are needed because of the demands of the course, general possession by other students, and the disadvantage imposed on a Veteran student by not having the item.
              (b) Partial payment agreements. Agreements in which VA would pay the institution a partial payment with the remainder to be paid by the Veteran student are not authorized.
              (c) Thesis expenses. The institution's costs in connection with a Veteran student's thesis are considered supplies and are therefore authorized for reimbursement if the Veteran student's committee chairman, major professor, department head, or appropriate dean certifies that the thesis is a course requirement and the expenses are required to complete the thesis. These expenses may include research expenses, typing, printing, microfilming, or otherwise reproducing the required number of copies.
              (d) Reimbursement for books, supplies, and equipment. Books, supplies, and equipment that the institution purchases specifically for trainees will be reimbursed at the net cost to the institution. The VA shall reimburse the institution for books, supplies, and equipment when these items are—
              (1) Issued to students from its own bookstore or supply store;
              (2) Issued to students from retail stores or other non-institutionally owned establishments not owned by the contractor/institution but arranged or designated by them in cooperation with VA; or
              (3) Rented or leased books, supplies and equipment and are issued to students for survey classes when it is customary that students are not required to own the books.
              (e) Handling charges. VA shall reimburse the institution for any handling charges not to exceed more than 10 percent of the allowable charge for the books, equipment or other supplies unless—
              (1) The tuition covers the charges for supplies or rentals or a stipulated fee is assessed to all students; or
              (2) The handling charge is for Government-owned books that the contractor procures from the Library of Congress.
            
            
              831.7001-4
              Medical services and hospital care.
              (a) VA may pay the customary student health fee when payment of the fee is required for similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students. If payment of the fee is not required for similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students, payment may be made if VA determines that payment is in the best interest of the Veteran student and the Government.

              (b) When the customary Veteran student's health fee does not cover medical services or hospital care, but these medical services are available in an institution-operated facility or with doctors and hospitals in the immediate area through a prior arrangement, VA may provide reimbursement for these services in a contract for the services if—
              
              (1) An arrangement is necessary to provide timely medical services for Veteran-students attending the facility under provisions of chapter 31; and
              (2) The general rates established for medical services do not exceed the rates established by VA.
              (c) VA may reimburse a rehabilitation facility for incidental medical services provided during a Veteran student's program at the facility.
            
            
              831.7001-5
              Consumable instructional supplies.
              (a) VA will provide reimbursement for consumable instructional supplies that the institution requires for the instruction of all students, Veteran or non-Veteran students, pursuing the same or comparable course or courses when—
              (1) The supplies are entirely consumed in the fabrication of a required project; or
              (2) The supplies are not consumed but are of such a nature that they cannot be salvaged from the end product for reuse by disassembling or dismantling the end product.
              (b) VA will not provide reimbursement for consumable instructional supplies if any of the following apply:
              (1) The supplies can be salvaged for reuse.
              (2) The supplies are used in a project that the student has elected as an alternate class project to produce an end product of greater value than that normally required to learn the skills of the occupation, and the end product will become the Veteran's property upon completion.
              (3) The supplies are used in a project that the institution has selected to provide the student with a more elaborate end product than is required to provide adequate instruction as an inducement to the Veteran student to elect a particular course of study.
              (4) The sale value of the end product is equal to or greater than the cost of supplies plus assembly, and the supplies have not been reasonably used so that the supplies are not readily salvaged from the end product to be reused for instructional purposes.
              (5) The end product is of permanent value and retained by the institution.
              (6) A third party loans the articles or equipment for repair or improvement and the third party would otherwise pay a commercial price for the repair or improvement.
              (7) The number of projects resulting in end products exceeds the number normally required to teach the recognized job operations and processes of the occupation stipulated in the approved course of study.

            (1) The notice of proposed action will be sent to the last known address of the contractor, the contractor's counsel, or agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or any other method that provides signed evidence of receipt. In the case of a business, the notice of proposed action may be sent to any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture. The contractor will be afforded an opportunity to appear before the RCO to present information or argument in person or through a representative and may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument.
            (2) The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. The proceedings will be conducted in an informal manner and without the requirement for a transcript. If the RCO does not receive a reply from the contractor within 30 calendar days, the RCO will base his or her recommendations on the information available. Any recommendation of the RCO under FAR 31.006-4(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, must address the results of this notification and the information, if any, provided by the contractor. After reviewing all the information, the RCO shall make a recommendation to the SPE whether or not substantial evidence of fraud exists.

              Electronic payment requests.
              (a) The contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form unless directed by the contracting officer to submit payment requests by mail. Purchases paid with a Government-wide commercial purchase card are considered to be an electronic transaction for purposes of this rule, and therefore no additional electronic invoice submission is required.

              (1) Awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States;

              (2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise the safeguarding of classified or privacy information;
              
              (3) Contracts awarded by contracting officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to national emergencies;
              (4) Solicitations or contracts in which the designated agency office is a VA entity other than the VA Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas; or
              (5) Solicitations or contracts in which the VA designated agency office does not have electronic invoicing capability as described above.

              (b) A system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) formats established by the Accredited Standards Center (ASC) chartered by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

              833.103-70
              Protests to VA.
              (a) Agency protests. Pursuant to FAR 33.103(d)(4), an interested party may protest to the contracting officer or, as an alternative, may request an independent review at a level above the contracting officer as provided in this section. An interested party may also appeal to VA a contracting officer's decision on a protest.
              (1) Protests to the contracting officer. Protests to the contracting officer shall be in writing and shall be addressed where the offer/bid is to be submitted or as indicated in the solicitation.
              (2) Independent review or appeal of a contracting officer decision—protest filed directly with the agency. (i) Protests requesting an independent review a level above the contracting officer, and appeals within VA above the level of the contracting officer, shall be addressed to: Executive Director, Office of Acquisition and Logistics, Risk Management and Compliance Service (RMCS), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420.

              (ii) The protest and pertinent documents shall be mailed to the address in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section or sent electronically to: EDProtests@va.gov.
              
              (3) An independent review of a protest filed pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section will not be considered if the interested party has a protest on the same or similar issues pending with the contracting officer.
              (b) Agency actions on specific types of protests. The following types of protests may be dismissed by VA without consideration of the merits or may be forwarded to another agency for appropriate action:
              (1) Contract administration. Disputes between a contractor and VA are resolved under the disputes clause see the Dispute statute, 41 U.S.C. chapter 71.
              (2) Small business size standards and standard industrial classification. Challenges of established size standards, ownership and control or the size status of particular firm, and challenges of the selected standard industrial classification are for review solely by the Small Business Administration (SBA) (see 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(6); 13 CFR 121.1002). Pursuant to Public Law 114-328, SBA will also hear cases related to size, status, and ownership and control challenges under the VA Veterans First Contracting Program (see 38 U.S.C. 8127(f)(8)).
              (3) Small business certificate of competency program. A protest made under section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act, or in regard to any issuance of a certificate of competency or refusal to issue a certificate under that section, is not reviewed in accordance with bid protest procedures unless there is a showing of possible fraud or bad faith on the part of Government officials.
              (4) Protests under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. The decision to place or not to place a procurement under the 8(a) program is not subject to review unless there is a showing of possible fraud or bad faith on the part of Government officials or that regulations may have been violated (see 15 U.S.C. 637(a)).
              (5) Affirmative determination of responsibility by the contracting officer. An affirmative determination of responsibility will not be reviewed unless there is a showing that such determination was made fraudulently or in bad faith or that definitive responsibility criteria in the solicitation were not met.
              (6) Contracts for materials, supplies, articles, and equipment exceeding $15,000. Challenges concerning the legal status of a firm as a regular dealer or manufacturer within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. chapter 65 are determined solely by the procuring agency, the SBA (if a small business is involved), and the Secretary of Labor (see FAR subpart 22.6).
              (7) Subcontractor protests. The contracting agency will not consider subcontractor protests except where VA determines it is in the interest of the Government.
              (8) Judicial proceedings. The contracting agency will not consider protests where the matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.
              (c) Alternative dispute resolution. Bidders/offerors and VA contracting officers are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures to resolve protests at any stage in the protest process. If ADR is used, VA will not furnish any documentation in an ADR proceeding beyond what is allowed by the FAR.
              (d) Appeal of contracting officer's protest decision—agency appellate review. An interested party may request an independent review of a contracting officer's protest decision by filing an appeal in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (1) To be considered timely, the appeal must be received by the cognizant official in paragraph (a)(2) of this section within 10 calendar days of the date the interested party knew, or should have known, whichever is earlier, of the basis for the appeal.
              (2) Appeals do not extend the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) timeliness requirements for protests to GAO. By filing an appeal as provided in this paragraph (d), an interested party may waive its rights to further protest to the Comptroller General at a later date.
              (3) Agency responses to appeals submitted to the agency shall be reviewed and concurred in by the Office of the General Counsel (OGC).

              Suspected fraudulent claims.

              The contracting officer must refer matters relating to suspected fraudulent claims to the Office of Inspector General for investigation and potential referral to the Department of Justice. The contracting officer may not initiate any collection, recovery, or other settlement action while the matter is in the hands of the Department of Justice without first obtaining the concurrence of the U.S. Attorney concerned, through the Office of the Inspector General.

              Obligation to continue performance.

              (a) As provided in FAR 33.213, contracting officers shall use FAR clause 52.233-1, Disputes, or with its Alternate I. FAR clause 52.233-1 requires the contractor to continue performance in accordance with the contracting officer's decision in the event of a claim arising under a contract. Alternate I expands this authority, adding a requirement for the contractor to continue performance in the event of a claim relating to the contract.
              (b) In the event of a dispute not arising under, but relating to, the contract, as permitted by FAR 33.213(b), if the contracting officer directs continued performance and considers providing financing for such continued performance, the contracting officer shall contact OGC for advice prior to requesting higher level approval for or authorizing such financing. The contracting officer shall document in the contract file any required approvals and how the Government's interest was properly secured with respect to such financing (see FAR 32.202-4 and VAAR subpart 832.2).

              (c) After the bids are read and recorded during a Public Bid Opening, remove the “For Official Use Only (FOUO)” designation then read and record the estimate as if it were a bid, in the same detail as the bids; and
              
              (d) In instances where only one bid has been received, the government estimate shall not be read by the contracting officer as it may be needed to conduct negotiations with the offeror.

              (b) The contracting officer will enter into negotiations with local funeral directors to procure a complete funeral and burial service within the statutory allowance of $300. The purchase order must list the specific services to be provided. The services must consist of the following:

              (2) Clothing.
              (3) Casket. (The casket, at a minimum, must be constructed from thick, strong particle board and must be of sufficient strength to support the weight of an adult human body. Cardboard or press paper or similar materials are not acceptable.)

              (c) An additional allowance for transportation of the body to the place of burial is provided in 38 U.S.C. 2308. This allowance will cover the transportation cost of shipment of the body by common carrier or by hearse from the VA facility to the funeral home and to the place of burial, any charges for an outside shipping box, and the charges for securing all necessary permits for removal or shipment of the body. These costs are not chargeable against the $300 allowance.

This designee will also be responsible for certifying receipt on the receiving report.
              (e) The HCA will assist the Chief, MAS, or the person designated by the facility director to perform these functions, in developing the local procedures specified in M-1, Part I, paragraph 14.37c. (38 U.S.C. 2302, 2303, and 2308)

              (2) No relatives or friends claim the remains; and
              (3) The municipal, county, or State officials refuse to provide for final disposition.
              (b) When the contracting officer cannot obtain a full and complete funeral and burial service as prescribed in 837.7003 within the statutory allowance, before taking any further action, the contracting officer will secure from the facility or VISN director, as appropriate, a written determination that VA must accomplish the disposition of the remains as an administrative necessity. The facility director will also authorize in writing the expenditure of such additional funds as may be necessary for this purpose.
              (c) The contracting officer will make the facility director's determination and authorization a part of the contract file. (38 U.S.C. 2302)

              Contract audit responsibilities.
              (a) Contracting officers may use the support services of other agencies to the extent feasible. Examples of such services include: pre-award surveys; quality assurance and technical inspection of contract items; and review of contractors' procurement systems. Contracting officers obtaining support services from any other Government department or agency must do so on the basis of an approved negotiated interagency support agreement.
              (b) An interagency support agreement is a written instrument of understanding between the parties to the agreement. The agreement should clearly state the following:
              (1) The accord reached between the two parties involved, especially the obligations assumed and the rights granted each party.
              (2) The resources that both the supplying and receiving parties will provide.
              (3) The funding and reimbursement arrangements.
              (4) Clauses permitting revisions, modifications, or cancellation of the agreement.

              (1) Federal Supply Schedule and other contracts awarded by the VA National Acquisition Center;
              (2) Scarce medical specialist or sharing contracts awarded under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 7409 or 8153, and;
              (3) Claims involving such contracts.

              (b) Contracting officers may request the assistance of either the VA OIG Office of Contract Review or the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) to provide pre- and post-award audit, review, and advisory services associated with other types of contracts or claims.

              (a) Except when the quick-closeout procedures described in FAR 42.708 are used, contracting officers must request audits on proposed final indirect cost rates and billing rates for use in cost reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, and fixed-price redeterminable contracts as prescribed in FAR Subpart 42.7.
              (b) When the quick closeout procedures are used, the contracting officers must perform a review and validation of the contractor's data for accuracy and reasonableness of the proposed rates for negotiating the settlement of indirect costs for a specific contract.

              If a contracting officer determines that costs should be disallowed during the performance of a cost reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redetermination contract exceeding the thresholds specified in FAR 15.403-4, the contracting officer must request audit assistance. The VA OIG shall conduct audits of contracts for health care resources and contracting officers shall request such audits directly from that office. For all other types of contracts, the contracting officer must obtain an audit control number from Acquisition Resources Service and send a formal request to conduct the audit directly to the nearest Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office, referencing the audit control number and the project number (if any).

                (ii) Federal personnel who are identified for release from their competitive levels or separated as a result of the contract.
                (2) Employment openings means position vacancies created by this contract that the contractor is unable to fill with personnel in the contractor's employ at the time of the contract award. The term includes positions within a 50-mile radius of the commercial activity that indirectly arise in the contractor's organization as a result of the contractor's reassignment of employees due to the award of this contract.
                (3) Contract start date means the first day of contractor performance.
                (c) Filling employment openings. (1) For a period beginning with contract award and ending 90 calendar days after the contract start date, no person other than adversely affected Federal personnel on the current listing provided by the contracting officer shall be offered an employment opening until all adversely affected and qualified Federal personnel identified by the contracting officer have been offered the job and refused it.
                (2) The contractor may select any person for an employment opening when there are no qualified adversely affected Federal personnel on the latest current listing provided by the contracting officer.
                (d) Contracting reporting requirements. (1) No later than 5 working days after contract award, the contractor shall furnish the contracting officer with the following:
                (i) A list of employment openings including salaries and benefits, and
                (ii) Sufficient job application forms for adversely affected Federal personnel.
                (2) By the contract start date, the contractor shall provide the contracting officer with the following:
                (i) The names of adversely affected Federal personnel offered an employment opening;
                (ii) The date the offer was made;
                (iii) A brief description of the position;
                (iv) The date of acceptance of the offer and the effective date of employment;
                (v) The date of rejection of the offer, if applicable, and the salary and benefits contained in the rejected offer; and
                (vi) The names of any adversely affected Federal personnel who applied but were not offered employment and the reason(s) for withholding an offer.
                (3) For the first 90 calendar days after the contract start date, the contractor shall provide the contracting officer with the names of all persons hired or terminated under the contract within 5 working days of such hiring or termination.
                (e) Information provided to the contractor. (1) No later than 10 calendar days after the contract award, the contracting officer shall furnish the contractor a current list of adversely affected Federal personnel exercising the right of first refusal, along with their completed job application forms.
                (2) Between the contract award and start dates, the contracting officer shall inform the contractor of any reassignment or transfer of adversely affected Federal personnel to other Federal positions.

                (3) For a period of up to 90 calendar days after the contract start date, the contracting officer will periodically provide the contractor with an updated listing of adversely affected Federal personnel reflecting personnel who were recently released from their competitive levels or separated as a result of the contract award.
                
                (f) Qualifications determination. The contractor has a right under this clause to determine adequacy of the qualifications of adversely affected Federal personnel for any employment openings. However, adversely affected Federal personnel who held jobs in the Government commercial activity that directly correspond to an employment opening shall be considered qualified for the job.

                Organizational Conflicts of Interest (JAN 2008)
                (a) It is in the best interest of the Government to avoid situations which might create an organizational conflict of interest or where the offeror's performance of work under the contract may provide the contractor with an unfair competitive advantage. The term “organizational conflict of interest” means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the person has an unfair competitive advantage.
                (b) The offeror shall provide a statement with its offer which describes, in a concise manner, all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) or actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the services to be provided under this solicitation. The offeror shall also provide statements with its offer containing the same information for any consultants and subcontractors identified in its proposal and which will provide services under the solicitation. The offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how its organizational and/or management system or other actions would avoid or mitigate any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest.
                (c) Based on this information and any other information solicited or obtained by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists which would warrant disqualifying the contractor for award of the contract unless the organizational conflict of interest can be mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction by negotiating terms and conditions of the contract to that effect. If the conflict of interest cannot be mitigated and if the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract, the contracting officer shall request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 and 48 CFR 809.503.
                (d) Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest at the time of the offer, or arising as a result of a modification to the contract, may result in the termination of the contract at no expense to the Government.

                Economic Price Adjustment of Contract Price(s) Based on a Price Index (DATE)
                (a) To the extent that contract cost increases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract for the base period and any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent cost increases.
                (b) The Base and Adjusting Indexes, for the purpose of price adjustment under this clause, shall be ___,1
                   as contained in ___,2
                   as published by ___.3
                   All adjustments authorized under this clause shall be made by using the Base Index and Adjusting Indexes, which are published ___.4
                  
                
                
                  
                    1 The Contracting Officer shall conduct market research to determine a suitable Consumer Price Index or other independent broad-based index to use for the solicitation. For example, for medical services, an appropriate index may be the Consumer Price Index that tracks medical services.
                
                
                  

                    2 Specify where the Index can be found, such as in a solicitation for laboratory services, the Contracting Officer might enter “Table 1, CPI-U: U.S. City Average, by expenditure category and commodity and service group, found at http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm”.
                  
                
                
                  

                    3 Provide the information on who publishes the applicable Index used, e.g., in the example for laboratory services, “the U.S. Department of Labor”.
                
                
                  
                    4 State how often the Index is published, such as “monthly, around the middle of the month”. Note that some Consumer Price Indexes are not published monthly. Ensure that the correct information is provided for the specific Index used.
                
                (1) The Base Index, for the purposes of price adjustment under this clause, shall be the most recent Index published prior to the date for receipt of offers, or the due date for receipt of best and final offers if discussions were held whichever is later. The Base Index shall remain constant for the entire term of the contract, including all option periods.
                (2) The Adjusting Index shall be the most recent Index published prior to the date of contract adjustment, as specified in paragraph (d) of this clause.

                (c) The percentage difference between the Base Index and the Adjusting Index, rounded to the nearest .01 percent (e.g., 4.57%), will be used in calculating all adjustments to the following line items: ___.5

                   The prices for these line items will be multiplied by the percentage increase or decrease and the resulting amount will be added to or deducted from the original line item price for that contract period (e.g., Base Year) to arrive at the new contract price for those line items from the effective date of the adjustment to the beginning of the next contract adjustment period, rounded to the same number of decimal points as the prices originally bid. Calculations for option year contract terms will be based on the prices in the schedule for those option years.
                
                  
                    5 Enter the line items that will be subject to adjustment or revise this paragraph to otherwise state what prices are subject to adjustment under this clause.
                
                (d) The dates of contract adjustment shall be ___ 6

                   and the starting dates of each option year, if not already included in these dates. The Contracting Officer shall retain a copy of the Base Index in the contract file and, on each date of adjustment specified in this paragraph (d), shall obtain a copy of the Adjusting Index. The Contracting Officer shall calculate the adjustment due and shall, within 5 business days, issue a modification to the contract adjusting the unit or contract prices, as specified in paragraph (c). The adjusted unit or contract prices shall be effective for all orders placed or services provided after the date of contract adjustment as specified in this paragraph (d) until the beginning of the next contract adjustment period. If the Contracting Officer fails to act, the Contractor shall request in writing a contract adjustment and any subsequent adjustment shall be retroactive to the applicable date of contract adjustment specified in this paragraph (d). The Contractor's entitlement to price increases for a prior contract period (base year or option year) is waived unless the Contractor's written request for an adjustment under this clause is received by the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days following the end of the base year for changes applicable to the base year, or 30 days following the end of each option year for changes applicable to that option year. The Government's right to contract decreases for prior contract periods (base year or option year) is waived unless the Contracting Officer processes a contract modification no later than 30 days following the end of the base year for changes applicable to the base year, or 30 days following the end of each option year for changes applicable to that option year.
                
                  
                    6 Establish time periods for when the Contracting Officer will process adjustments. This could be “the first day of every quarter, January, April, July, and October” or “Annually on October 1st” or some other similar time periods. Since the contracting officer is responsible for initiating the change, the Contracting Officer must establish a reminder mechanism to ensure that the adjustments are accomplished within the time period specified.
                
                (e) An example of an adjustment calculation is provided herein for informational purposes only.

                (1) The original contract price or line item prices for that contract term (e.g., base year) shall be used for all calculations during that particular contract term and new calculations shall be made for each and every contract adjustment period specified in paragraph (d) during that contract term.
                (2) For purposes of this example, the contract prices for the line items as specified in paragraph (c) will be adjusted by the percentage calculated as follows:
                
                  
                    Adjusting Index for the current period
                    196.6
                  
                  
                    Minus the Base Index
                    −188.0
                  
                  
                    Equals the Index Point Change
                    8.6
                  
                  
                    Index Point Change Divided by the Base Index
                    8.6/188.0 = .0457 *
                  
                  
                    Result Multiplied by 100 Equals the Percentage Change
                    4.57%
                  
                  
                    (The Index Point Change Percentage)
                  
                  * This figure shall be rounded to the fourth decimal place. When the fifth decimal is 1 to 4, the figure shall be rounded down, 5 to 9, rounded up.
                
                (3) For a line item with an original bid price of $25.00 and a 4.57 percent Index Point Change increase as of the first contract adjustment period, as shown above, the calculations for a new contract price for the first contract adjustment period would be as follows: $25.00 × .0457 = $1.14, $25 + $1.14 = $26.14 **. The new contract price for this line item from the beginning of that first contract adjustment period until the start of the next contract adjustment period would be $26.14 and the Contracting Officer would issue a contract modification reflecting this price change. ** The unit price adjustment shall be rounded up or down, as in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause, to match the number of decimal places in the original bid.
                (4) If the Adjusting Index went down for the second adjustment period, reflecting only a 3 percent Index Point Change increase over the Base Index, the new price for this sample line item would be reduced for the second contract adjustment period from $26.14 to $25.75 as follows: $25 × .03 = $0.75, $25 + $0.75 = $25.75. Note that the calculations for the second contract adjustment period are based on the original contract price for that contract term of $25.00. The contract price for this line item is modified to reflect this new price for the second contract adjustment period.

                (5) At the start of the first option year and each subsequent option year period (as well as for each contract adjustment period specified in paragraph (d) during that option year, if different), the Contracting Officer shall recalculate the contract or unit prices for that first option year based on any changes between the Adjusting Index and the Base Index, from the original contract award date to the start of the first option period, and based on the Contractor's new option year prices. Assume the Contractor's bid price for the first option year for the above sample line item was $25.50 and the calculations shown in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause at the start of the first option period reflected a 6 percent Index Point Change. The new contract price for this sample line item at the start of the first option period would be calculated as follows: $25.50 × .06 = $1.53, $25.50 + $1.53 = $27.03. The Contracting Officer would process a contract modification reflecting a revised contract price of $27.03 for the first contract adjustment period in the first option year.
                (f) Price adjustments pursuant to this clause, shall be documented by a contract modification issued by the Contracting Officer, show the Base Index (see paragraph (b)(1)), the Adjusting Index, the adjusted contract prices (see paragraph (c)), the mathematical calculations used to arrive at the adjusted contract prices, and the effective date of the adjustment (see paragraph (d)).
                (g) At the start of each option year, the Contracting Officer shall, within 5 days of the start of the option year period, process a contract modification adjusting the option year prices by the then current Index Point Change percentage, if any, reflecting the new adjusted prices for that first contract adjustment period in that option year.
                (h) In the event that ___ 7
                   discontinues, or alters substantially, its method of calculating the Index cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein. If the Contracting Officer determines that the Index consistently and substantially fails to reflect market conditions, the Contracting Officer may modify the contract to specify the use of an appropriate substitute index, effective on the date the Index specified herein begins to consistently and substantially fail to reflect market conditions.
                
                  
                    7 Enter in the name of the entity whose index is used in the clause. In most cases when using this clause format, the index used would be a CPI-U Index and the Contracting Officer would enter “the U.S. Department of Labor”.
                
                (i) Any dispute arising under this clause shall be resolved subject to the “Disputes” clause of the contract.

              852.216-72
              Proportional economic price adjustment of contract price(s) based on a price index.
              As prescribed in 816.203-4(e)(2), insert the following clause:
              
                Proportional Economic Price Adjustment of Contract Price(s) Based on a Price Index (DATE)
                (a) To the extent that contract cost increases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract for any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent cost increases.
                (b) The cost index, for the purpose of price adjustment under this clause, shallbe ___ 1
                   as contained in ___ 2
                  as published by ___ .3
                   All adjustments authorized under this clause shall be made by using the Base Index and Adjusting Indexes, which are published ___ .4
                  
                
                
                  
                    1 The Contracting Officer shall conduct market research to determine a suitable cost index for use in the solicitation. The index used is directly related to the type of commodity or service most likely to impact the Contractor and must approximately track the economic changes affecting the Contractor's costs. For transportation services, an appropriate index might be one that tracks the price of gasoline or diesel fuel. For example, in a solicitation for ambulance services, the Contracting Officer might enter into this block “the “Weekly U.S. Retail Gasoline Prices, Regular Grade” Index for New England” (or California or whichever index is the most appropriate).
                
                
                  
                    2 Specify where the index can be found, such as in an example for gasoline, “the Energy Information Administration website (see VAAM M816.203-70).
                
                
                  
                    3 Provide the information on who publishes the index, such as, in an example for gasoline, “the U.S. Department of Energy.”
                
                
                  
                    4 State how often the index used is published, such as, in an example for an index for gasoline, “weekly each Monday at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time),” or “Tuesday if Monday is a holiday.”
                
                (1) The Base Index, for the purposes of price adjustment under this clause, shall be the most recent Index published prior to the closing date for receipt of offers, or the due date for receipt of best and final offers if discussions are held. This Base Index shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract, including all options.
                (2) The Adjusting Index shall be the most recent Index published prior to the date of contract adjustment, as specified in paragraph (f).
                (c) For purposes of this clause, it will be conclusively presumed that ___ percent (%) 5
                   of the price of ___ 6
                   represents the Base Cost of ___ 7
                   and the resulting Base Cost will be the basis upon which adjustment will be made under this clause. This Base Cost will be used in calculating all adjustments to the following line items: ___.8
                   A new Base Cost will be calculated for each option year period based on the new option year prices.
                
                  
                    5 Prior to issuing the solicitation, the Contracting Officer must conduct market research to determine an appropriate percentage to include in this paragraph. The percentage should reflect that portion of the unit price for the services or supplies being acquired that is applicable to the indexed commodity. For instance, in the case of an ambulance contract, research might indicate that, at the time the solicitation is being drafted and based on prior per-mile bid prices, the cost of gasoline accounts for 10% of the per mile cost of operating an ambulance. For example, if the prior bid price had been $1.60 per mile, ambulances average 10 miles per gallon, and the cost of gasoline had been $1.559 per gallon, 1 mile's worth of gasoline ($.16) would be approximately ten (10) percent of the prior per mile bid price of $1.60 per mile. This percent must be stated in the solicitation so that the same figure applies to all bidders. This figure remains constant throughout the life of the contract.
                
                
                  

                    6 Enter in this block the portion of the contract that will be subject to price adjustment, e.g., “each one-way mile of ambulance services,” or the line items that will be subject to price adjustment.
                
                
                  
                    7 Enter in this block the commodity applicable to the index being used, as in an example for an ambulance contract, “regular grade gasoline”.
                
                
                  
                    8 Enter the line items that will be subject to adjustment, as in an example for an ambulance contract, the line items that reflect the one-way cost per mile for ambulance services for the base year and for each option year.
                
                (d) The percentage of the price of the indexed commodity (see paragraph (c)) remains fixed throughout the life of the contract and is not subject to modification under this clause. Any pricing actions pursuant to the “Changes” clause or other clause or provision of the contract, except for this clause, will be priced as though there were no provisions for economic price adjustment.
                (e) All price adjustments shall be applicable only to the specific contract adjustment period to which the calculations are made. For every contract adjustment period, new calculations shall be made and new prices determined. Every adjustment during the Base Year shall be based on the original contract prices for that contract year and every adjustment during an option year shall be based on the original contract prices for that option year. The Contracting Officer must make new calculations for each and every contract adjustment period specified in paragraph (f) and at the beginning of each new option year, if different.
                (f) The dates of contract adjustment shall be ___ 9

                   and the starting dates of each option year, if not already included in these dates. The Contracting Officer shall retain a copy of the Base Index in the contract file and, on each date of adjustment specified herein, obtain a copy of the Adjusting Index. The Contracting Officer shall calculate the adjustment due and shall, within 5 business days, issue a modification to the contract adjusting the contract or unit price(s). The adjusted contract or unit price(s) shall be effective for all orders placed or services provided after the date of contract adjustment, as specified in this paragraph (f), until the date of the next contract adjustment. If the Contracting Officer fails to act, the Contractor shall request a contract adjustment in writing and any subsequent adjustment shall be retroactive to the applicable date of contract adjustment. The Contractor's entitlement to price increases for a prior contract period (base year or option year) shall be waived unless the Contractor's written request for an adjustment under this clause is received by the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days following the end of the base year for changes applicable to the base year, or 30 days following the end of each option year for changes applicable to that option year. The Government's right to contract decreases for prior contract periods (base year or option year) shall be waived unless the Contracting Officer processes a contract modification no later than 30 days following the end of the base year for changes applicable to the base year, or 30 days following the end of each option year for changes applicable to that option year.
                
                  
                    9 Establish time periods for when the Contracting Officer will process adjustments. This could be “the first day of each month” or “the first day of every quarter, January, April, July, and October” or “annually on October 1st” or some other similar time periods. Since the Contracting Officer is responsible for initiating the change, the Contracting Officer must establish a reminder mechanism to ensure that the adjustments are accomplished on time.
                
                (g) An example of an adjustment calculation is provided herein for informational purposes only.
                (1) For purposes of this example, assume that a contract is for ambulance services, that the contract price is $2.10 per mile one way, that price adjustments will be made on the basis of the cost of gasoline, that the cost of gasoline represents 10% of the total cost per mile (the Base Cost is 10% of $2.10 (the per mile one way price in Line Item X), or $0.21), and that contract adjustments will be made quarterly. If the Base Index (the price of gasoline the week prior to receipt of bids) is $1.559 per gallon and the price of gasoline at the first date of contract adjustment is $2.129 per gallon, the calculations for contract price adjustment would be as follows:
                
                  
                    Adjusting Index (most recent Index cost of gasoline as of the date of the first adjustment period)
                    $2.129 per gallon.
                  
                  
                    Minus the Base Index (Index cost of gasoline as of the date of receipt of offers)
                    −$1.559 per gallon.
                  
                  
                    Equals increase (or decrease) to the Base Index
                    $0.570.
                  
                  
                    Divide increase (or decrease) to the Base Index by the Base Index
                    $0.570 + $1.559 = .3656 *(36.56% increase).
                    
                  
                  
                    Base Cost of $0.21 (10% of $2.10) multiplied by .3656 = $0.0768 unit price increase.New Unit price following the adjustment is $2.10 plus $0.0768 = $2.1768 per mile (rounded to $2.18) **
                  
                  * This figure shall be rounded to the fourth decimal place. When the fifth decimal is 1 to 4, the figure shall be rounded down, 5 to 9, rounded up.
                  ** The unit price adjustment shall be rounded up or down, as above, to match the number of decimal places in the original bid.
                
                (2) For the second contract adjustment period, all calculations would be based on the original contract bid price for that contract year, $2.10 per mile in this example. If the price of gasoline goes down during the second adjustment period to the original Base Index price of $1.559 per gallon, the adjusted contract price for that second period would return to $2.10 per mile (there would be a zero percent increase or decrease to the Base Cost and thus no change to the original bid price for that contract adjustment period). The Contracting Officer would then issue a contract modification returning the contract price from $2.18 to $2.10 per mile for that contract adjustment period. If, on the other hand, the price of gasoline actually went below the Base Index price, say to $1.449 per gallon, the calculations for the second economic price adjustment period would be as follows:
                
                  
                    Adjusting Index (most recent Index cost of gasoline as of the date of the second adjustment period)
                    $1.449 per gallon.
                  
                  
                    Minus the Base Index (Index cost of gasolineas of the date of receipt of offers)
                    −$1.559 per gallon.
                  
                  
                    Equals increase (or decrease) to Base Index
                    ($0.110) (a negative $.11).
                  
                  
                    Divide increase (or decrease) to theBase Index by the Base Index
                    ($0.11) + $1.559 = (.0706) (7.06% decrease).
                  
                  
                    Base Cost of $0.21 (10% of $2.10) multiplied by (.0706) = ($0.0148) unit price decrease
                  
                  
                    New Unit price following the second economic price adjustment is $2.10 minus $0.0148 = $2.0852 per mile (rounded to $2.09)
                  
                
                
                (3) At the start of the first option year, the Contracting Officer shall recalculate the price per mile based on any changes in the price of gasoline from the original contract award date and based on the Contractor's new first option year price per mile. Assuming the Contractor's bid price per mile for the first option year was $2.25 per mile, the new Base Cost for gasoline would be 10% of $2.25, or $0.225 (note that the original percent figure from paragraph (c) (10% in this sample) stays constant throughout the life of the contract), but the Base Cost would change if the option year contract price changes. If the Adjusting Index for gasoline at the start of the first option year was now up to $1.899 per gallon, the new first option year price for the first contract adjustment period would be calculated as follows:
                
                  
                    Adjusting Index (most recent Index cost of gasoline as of the first day of the first option period)
                    $1.899 per gallon.
                  
                  
                    Minus the Base Index (Index cost of gasoline as of the date of receipt of offers)
                    −$1.559 per gallon.
                  
                  
                    Equals increase (or decrease) to the Base Index
                    $0.340.
                  
                  
                    Divide the increase (or decrease) to the Base Index by the Base Index
                    $0.34 + $1.559 = .2181 (21.81% increase).
                  
                  
                    Base Cost of $0.225 (10%* of $2.25) multiplied by .2181 = $0.0491 unit price increase
                  
                  
                    New Unit price for the first contract adjustment period in the first option year is $2.25 plus $0.0491 = $2.2991 per mile (rounded to $2.30 per mile).
                  
                  * Note that the percentage remains constant (10%) but that the Base Cost has been increased for the first contract adjustment period in the first option year, since the Base Cost is a percentage of the first option year unit cost per mile (in this sample), and the unit cost per mile has increased in this sample for the first option year from $2.10 to $2.25.Although the new unit price for the first contract adjustment period of the first option year following application of the economic price adjustment in this sample would be $2.30 per mile, all economic price adjustment calculations made during that first option year would be based on the original first option year bid price ($2.25 in this sample). If in the second contract adjustment period of the first option year, the calculations resulted in a unit price increase for gasoline of $0.0332, the adjusted price for that period would be $2.25 + $0.0332 = $2.2832, rounded to $2.28 per mile.

              Economic price adjustment—state nursing home care for veterans.
              As prescribed in 816.203-4(e)(3), insert the following clause:
              
                Economic Price Adjustment—State Nursing Home Care for Veterans (DATE)
                This clause does not apply to rates for non-Medicaid nursing homes.
                (a) Rate Determination. The per diem rate is established by the current Medicaid rate for Medicaid approved nursing home care plus a fair market amount (percentage) to cover the costs of supplies, services, and equipment above that provided under Medicaid established by the local State Medicaid Agency (SMA). Rates established after the effective date of this contract will require a modification to the contract by the Contacting Officer.
                (1) The Medicaid rate covers room, board, and routine nursing care services.
                (2) For all levels of nursing care a percentage is added for routine ancillary services/supplies, such as drugs, nursing supplies, oxygen (occasional use), x-ray, laboratory, physician visits, and rental equipment.
                (3) Special equipment, e.g. Clinitron bed, is not considered routine ancillary services (and may not be provided by the VA).
                (4) Drug costs which comprise more than eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of the per diem rate are generally not considered routine ancillary supplies (and may not be provided by the VA).

                (5) Rehabilitation therapies will be provided as distinct levels of care, i.e., skilled, intermediate, and custodial care. Hospice Care and Dialysis are not included in the rate. Payment for Hospices and Dialysis services is provided by the VA or other payers as determined by the Veteran with the VA's approval.
                (b) Economic Price Adjustment. This clause does not apply to ancillary services that may be added or deleted from the agreement.
                (1) The per diem rate(s) will apply throughout the term of this contract, including extension period(s). The rate(s) may be adjusted only to reflect a change in a Medicaid rate as authorized by the SMA. Normally, this will be on an annual basis. The negotiated percentage above the Medicaid rate, to cover the all-inclusive nature of the contract, will not be renegotiated; but will be applied and added to the new Medicaid rate for the adjusted per diem rate for each level of care item. In this regard, new rates will be negotiated requiring a modification to the contact. Each per diem price adjustment under this clause is subject to the following limitations:
                (2) Any adjustment shall be limited to the effect of increases or decreases in the approved SMA's patient care components within the affected Medicaid groups.
                (3) Adjustments will occur no more frequently than those issued by the SMA.
                (4) No adjustments are made until the Contracting Officer receives from the SMA an authenticated copy of the new rates signed and dated at the top right of the document by the authorized nursing home official. Within ten days after this occurs, the Contracting Officer will execute an approval signature and date at the approximate locations of the nursing home official's signature, the action of which will serve as the effective date of the adjusted rate. A copy of the fully executed document will be sent to the nursing home official for record keeping purposes.

                Economic Price Adjustment—Medicaid Labor Rates (DATE)
                This clause does not apply to rates for non-Medicaid nursing homes.

                (a) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if, at any time during contract performance, the Medicaid rate set by the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) for contract line item increases or decreases in the Schedule. The Contractor shall furnish this notice within 60 days after the increase or decrease, or within any additional period that the Contracting Officer may approve in writing, but not later than the date of final payment under this contract. The notice shall include the Contractor's proposal for an adjustment in the contract unit prices to be negotiated under paragraph (b) of this clause, and shall include, in the form required by the Contracting Officer, supporting data explaining the cause, effective date, and the amount of the increase or decrease and the amount of the Contractor's adjustment proposal.
                (b) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall negotiate a price adjustment to the contract's unit prices and its effective date upon receipt of the notice and data under paragraph (a) of this clause. However, the Contracting Officer may postpone the negotiations until an accumulation of increases and decreases of the Medicaid labor rates (including fringe benefits) shown in the Schedule results in an adjustment allowable under paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The Contracting Officer shall modify this contract as follows:
                (1) Include the price adjustment and its effective date;
                (2) Revise the Medicaid labor rates (including fringe benefits) as shown in the Schedule to reflect the increases or decreases resulting from the SMA adjustment. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on, or determination of, any adjustment and its effective date.
                (c) Any price adjustment under this clause is subject to the following limitations:
                (1) Adjustment shall be limited to the effect on unit prices of the increases or decreases of the Medicaid rates of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) shown in the Schedule. There shall be no adjustment for changes in rates or unit prices other than those shown in the Schedule.
                (2) No upward adjustment shall apply to supplies or services that are required to be delivered or performed before the effective date of the adjustment, unless the Contractor's failure to deliver or perform according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the Contractor's control and without its fault or negligence, within the meaning of the Default clause.
                (3) There shall be no adjustment for any change in rates of pay for labor (including fringe benefits) or unit prices for material which would not result in a net change of at least three percent of the then-current total contract price. This limitation shall not apply, however, if, after final delivery of all contract line items, either party requests an adjustment under paragraph (b) of this clause.
                (4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price made under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original unit price. There is no percentage limitation on the amount of decreases made under this clause.
                (d) The Contracting Officer, precluding certified cost and pricing data may examine the Contractor's books, records, and other supporting data relevant to the cost of labor (including fringe benefits) and material during all reasonable times until the end of 3 years after the date of final payment under this contract or the time periods specified in Subpart 4.7 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), whichever is earlier.

              Economic price adjustment clause—fuel surcharge.
              As prescribed in 816.203-4(e)(5), insert the following clause:
              
                Economic Price Adjustment Clause—Fuel Surcharge (DATE)
                (a) To the extent that contract fuel cost increases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract for any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent fuel cost increases.
                (b) The fuel cost index, for the purpose of price adjustment under this clause, shall be the “Weekly Retail On-Highway Diesel Prices Index.”
                The Base Fuel Cost, for the purpose of price adjustments under this clause, shall be the most recent Index Weekly Average Diesel Fuel Price per gallon published prior to the closing date for receipt of offers, or the due date for receipt of final proposal revisions if discussions are held.

                (c) For purposes of this clause, it will be conclusively presumed that x% increase or decrease of the Base Fuel Cost represents a reasonable fluctuation of diesel fuel prices. The Base Fuel Cost (±) x% price range will be determined for the base contract year and will remain constant throughout the life of the contract, including option years. Base Fuel Cost price range is documented at time of contract award.
                
                (d) Increases (or decreases) in the diesel fuel costs (Base Fuel Cost x%) as listed on the Index two weeks prior to the end of each calendar quarter can trigger a request from the Contractor to the Government (or from the Government to the Contractor) for cost adjustments. Notice must be in writing to the Subsistence Prime Vendor (SPV) Contracting Officer (or Contracting Officer's Representative) no less than ten days prior to the beginning of the next quarter.
                (e) Since fuel cost is only a part of the SPV Contracted distribution cost, the adjustment will be made as a penny per delivered case for every ten cent fuel price per gallon increase or decrease to the Base Fuel Cost x%. The difference is rounded down to the nearest whole cent and will be added to last line of each invoice noted as “Fuel Adjustment”.
                
                  
                    Example calculation of fuel price change:
                    Price $2.50 Base (+ or −) 15% Average National Diesel Fuel $2.88−$2.13.
                  
                  
                    3rd QTR (3rd week June) first year. Fuel Price $3.05 Calculation:
                    $3.05−2.88 = $.17 (rounded down to 10 cents) Add one cent per delivered case to each invoice, starting first Monday of July.
                  
                  
                    3rd QTR Diesel Fuel Price decrease
                    $2.13−1.80 = $ .33 (rounded down to $.30 cents) Credit each invoice.
                  
                  
                    $1.80 Calculation:
                    $.03 cents per delivered case.
                  
                
                (f) Once approved, the date for contract fuel price adjustment will be the first Monday of the first month of each quarter unless otherwise designated at time of contract award.
                (g) The Contracting Officer shall retain a copy of the Base Fuel Index establishing the Base Fuel Cost and the calculation of the price range incorporating the (±) x% adjustment in the contract file. All subsequent changes will be documented within the contract file and communicated to the Contractor and VA SPV customers via email one week prior to the fuel price adjustment implementation.
                (h) Any adjustments for fuel price changes will only be implemented if requested in writing, reviewed by both parties, and provided within the designated time frames. No retroactive cost adjustments will be made. A contract modification will be issued at inception of first increase or decrease detailing Base Fuel Cost, price range, and calculation of first fuel adjustment charge. Adjustment will remain in effect with quarterly calculation changes as needed until price falls within Base Fuel Cost price range. A contract modification will be issued to terminate the adjustment when price returns to Base Fuel Cost (±) x% price range.
                (i) In the event that “the Energy Information Administration, Department of Energy” discontinues, or substantially alters its method of calculating the national average diesel fuel prices cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein. If the Contracting Officer determines the Index consistently and substantially fails to reflect market conditions, the Contracting Officer may modify the contract to specify use of an appropriate substitute Index, effective on the date the Index specified herein begins to consistently and substantially fail to reflect market conditions.
                (j) Any dispute arising under this clause shall be determined in accordance with and subject to the “Disputes” clause of the contract.

[Contracting Officer's Note: In those instances where airplane service is to be used, substitute the word “aircraft” for “automobile” and “vehicle” and modify coverage to require aircraft public and passenger liability insurance of at least $200,000 per passenger and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury, other than passenger liability, and $200,000 per occurrence for property damage. Coverage for passenger liability bodily injury shall be at least $200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or passengers, whichever is greater.]

              Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (Without NAS-CPM).
              As prescribed in 832.111-70, insert the following clause in contracts that do not contain a section entitled “Network Analysis System—Critical Path”
              Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (Without NAS-CPM) (Nov 2018)
              The clause FAR 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, is implemented as follows:
              (a) Retainage. (1) The Contracting Officer may retain funds—
              (i) Where performance under the contract has been determined to be deficient or the Contractor has performed in an unsatisfactory manner in the past; or
              (ii) As the contract nears completion, to ensure that deficiencies will be corrected and that completion is timely.
              (2) Examples of deficient performance justifying a retention of funds include, but are not restricted to, the following—
              (i) Unsatisfactory progress as determined by the Contracting Officer;
              (ii) Failure to meet schedule in Schedule of Work Progress;
              (iii) Failure to present submittals in a timely manner; or
              (iv) Failure to comply in good faith with approved subcontracting plans, certifications, or contract requirements.
              (3) Any level of retention shall not exceed 10 percent either where there is determined to be unsatisfactory performance, or when the retainage is to ensure satisfactory completion. Retained amounts shall be paid promptly upon completion of all contract requirements, but nothing contained in this paragraph (a)(3) shall be construed as limiting the Contracting Officer's right to withhold funds under other provisions of the contract or in accordance with the general law and regulations regarding the administration of Government contracts.
              (b) The Contractor shall submit a schedule of cost to the Contracting Officer for approval within 30 calendar days after date of receipt of notice to proceed. Such schedule will be signed and submitted in triplicate. The approved cost schedule will be one of the bases for determining progress payments to the Contractor for work completed. This schedule shall show cost by the work activity/event for each building or unit of the contract, as instructed by the resident engineer.
              (1) The work activities/events shall be subdivided into as many sub-activities/events as are necessary to cover all component parts of the contract work.

              (2) Costs as shown on this schedule must be true costs and the resident engineer may require the Contractor to submit the original estimate sheets or other information to substantiate the detailed makeup of the schedule.
              
              (3) The sums of the sub-activities/events, as applied to each work activity/event, shall equal the total cost of such work activity/event. The total cost of all work activities/events shall equal the contract price.
              (4) Insurance and similar items shall be prorated and included in the cost of each branch of the work.
              (5) The cost schedule shall include separate cost information for the systems listed in the table in this paragraph (b)(5). The percentages listed in the following table are proportions of the cost listed in the Contractor's cost schedule and identify, for payment purposes, the value of the work to adjust, correct and test systems after the material has been installed. Payment of the listed percentages will be made only after the Contractor has demonstrated that each of the systems is substantially complete and operates as required by the contract.

              (6)(i) The Contractor shall at the time of contract award furnish the total cost of the guarantee period services in accordance with specification section(s) covering guarantee period services. The Contractor shall submit, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice to proceed, a guarantee period performance program that shall include an itemized accounting of the number of work-hours required to perform the guarantee period service on each piece of equipment. The Contractor shall also submit the established salary costs, including employee fringe benefits, and what the Contractor reasonably expects to pay over the guarantee period, all of which will be subject to the Contracting Officer's approval.
              (ii) The cost of the guarantee period service shall be prorated on an annual basis and paid in equal monthly payments by VA during the period of guarantee. In the event the installer does not perform satisfactorily during this period, all payments may be withheld and the Contracting Officer shall inform the Contractor of the unsatisfactory performance, allowing the Contractor 10 days to correct deficiencies and comply with the contract. The guarantee period service is subject to those provisions as set forth in the Payments and Default clauses.

              Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (Including NAS-CPM).
              As prescribed in 832.111-70, insert the following clause in contracts that contain a section entitled “Network Analysis System—Critical Path Method (NAS-CPM).”
              Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (Including NAS-CPM) (Nov 2018)
              The clause FAR 52.232-5, Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts, is implemented as follows:
              (a) Retainage. (1) The Contracting Officer may retain funds—
              (i) Where performance under the contract has been determined to be deficient or the Contractor has performed in an unsatisfactory manner in the past; or
              (ii) As the contract nears completion, to ensure that deficiencies will be corrected and that completion is timely.
              (2) Examples of deficient performance justifying a retention of funds include, but are not restricted to, the following—
              (i) Unsatisfactory progress as determined by the Contracting Officer;
              (ii) Failure to meet schedule in Schedule of Work Progress;
              (iii) Failure to present submittals in a timely manner; or
              (iv) Failure to comply in good faith with approved subcontracting plans, certifications, or contract requirements.

              (3) Any level of retention shall not exceed 10 percent either where there is determined to be unsatisfactory performance, or when the retainage is to ensure satisfactory completion. Retained amounts shall be paid promptly upon completion of all contract requirements, but nothing contained in this paragraph (a)(3) shall be construed as limiting the Contracting Officer's right to withhold funds under other provisions of the contract or in accordance with the general law and regulations regarding the administration of Government contracts.
              
              (b) The Contractor shall submit a schedule of costs in accordance with the requirements of section “Network Analysis System—Critical Path Method (NAS-CPM)” to the Contracting Officer for approval within 90 calendar days after date of receipt of notice to proceed. The approved cost schedule will be one of the bases for determining progress payments to the Contractor for work completed.
              (1) Costs as shown on this schedule must be true costs and the resident engineer may require the Contractor to submit its original estimate sheets or other information to substantiate the detailed makeup of the cost schedule.
              (2) The total costs of all work activities/events shall equal the contract price.
              (3) Insurance and similar items shall be prorated and included in each work activity/event cost of the critical path method (CPM).
              (4) The CPM shall include a separate cost loaded activity for adjusting and testing of the systems listed in the table in paragraph (b)(5) of this clause. The percentages listed in paragraph (b)(5) will be used to determine the cost of adjust and test work activities/events and identify, for payment purposes, the value of the work to adjust, correct and test systems after the material has been installed.
              (5) Payment for adjust and test activities will be made only after the Contractor has demonstrated that each of the systems is substantially complete and operates as required by the contract.

                (2) Designated agency office means the office designated by the purchase order, agreement, or contract to first receive and review invoices. This office can be contractually designated as the receiving entity. This office may be different from the office issuing the payment;
                (3) Electronic form means an automated system transmitting information electronically according to the accepted electronic data transmission methods and formats identified in paragraph (c) of this clause. Facsimile, email, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests;
                (4) Invoice payment has the meaning given in FAR 32.001; and
                (5) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.
                (b) Electronic payment requests. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form. Purchases paid with a Government-wide commercial purchase card are considered to be an electronic transaction for purposes of this rule, and therefore no additional electronic invoice submission is required.

                (1) VA's Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment System at the current website address provided in the contract.

                (d) Invoice requirements. Invoices shall comply with FAR 32.905.
                (e) Exceptions. If, based on one of the circumstances in this paragraph (e), the Contracting Officer directs that payment requests be made by mail, the Contractor shall submit payment requests by mail through the United States Postal Service to the designated agency office. Submission of payment requests by mail may be required for—
                (1) Awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States;
                (2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise the safeguarding of classified or privacy information;
                (3) Contracts awarded by Contracting Officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to national emergencies;
                (4) Solicitations or contracts in which the designated agency office is a VA entity other than the VA Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas; or
                (5) Solicitations or contracts in which the VA designated agency office does not have electronic invoicing capability as described above.

                (APR 2019). For new construction work with complex mechanical-electrical work, the following paragraph relating to work coordination may be substituted for paragraph (b) of the basic clause:

              (b) The Contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts and omissions of his/her own employees, and subcontractors and their employees. The Contractor shall also be responsible for coordination of the work of the trades, subcontractors, and material suppliers. The Contractor shall, in advance of the work, prepare coordination drawings showing the location of openings through slabs, the pipe sleeves and hanger inserts, as well as the location and elevation of utility lines, including, but not limited to, conveyor systems, pneumatic tubes, ducts, and conduits and pipes two inches and larger in diameter. These drawings, including plans, elevations, and sections as appropriate, shall clearly show the manner in which the utilities fit into the available space and relate to each other and to existing building elements. Drawings shall be of appropriate scale to satisfy the previously stated purposes, but not smaller than 3/8-inch scale. Drawings may be composite (with distinctive colors for the various trades) or may be separate but fully coordinated drawings (such as sepias or photographic paper reproducibles) of the same scale. Separate drawings shall depict identical building areas or sections and shall be capable of being overlaid in any combination. The submitted drawings for a given area of the project shall show the work of all trades that will be involved in that particular area. Six complete composite drawings or six complete sets of separate reproducible drawings shall be received by the Government not less than 20 days prior to the scheduled start of the work in the area illustrated by the drawings, for the purpose of showing the Contractor's planned methods of installation. The objectives of such drawings are to promote carefully planned work sequence and proper trade coordination, in order to assure the expeditious solutions of problems and the installation of lines and equipment as contemplated by the contract documents while avoiding or minimizing additional costs to the Contractor and to the Government. In the event the Contractor, in coordinating the various installations and in planning the method of installation, finds a conflict in location or elevation of any of the utilities with themselves, with structural items or with other construction items, he/she shall bring this conflict to the attention of the Contracting Officer immediately. In doing so, the Contractor shall explain the proposed method of solving the problem or shall request instructions as to how to proceed if adjustments beyond those of usual trades' coordination are necessary. Utilities installation work will not proceed in any area prior to the submission and completion of the Government review of the coordinated drawings for that area, nor in any area in which conflicts are disclosed by the coordination drawings, until the conflicts have been corrected to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to submit the required drawings in a timely manner consistent with the requirements to complete the work covered by this contract within the prescribed contract time.

                Notice to Bidders—Additive or Deductive Bid Line Items (Apr 2019)
                (a) Additive or deductive line items in the bid schedule shall be evaluated to determine the low offeror and the items to be awarded. The evaluation shall be made as follows—
                (1) Prior to the opening of bids, the Government will determine the amount of funds available for the project.
                (2) The low bid shall be the Bidder that—
                (i) Is otherwise eligible for award; and

                (ii) Offers the lowest aggregate amount for the first or base line item, plus or minus (in the order stated in the list of priorities in the bid schedule) those additive or deductive line items that provide the most features within the funds determined available.
                (3) All bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same additive or deductive line items.
                (i) If adding another item from the bid schedule list of priorities would make the award exceed the available funds for all offerors, the Contracting Officer will skip that item and go to the next item from the bid schedule of priorities; and
                (ii) Add that next item if an award may be made that includes that line item and is within the available funds.
                (b) The Contracting Officer will use the list of priorities in the bid schedule only to determine the low offeror. After determining the low offeror, an award may be made on any combination of items if—
                (1) It is in the best interest of the Government;
                (2) Funds are available at the time of award; and
                (3) The low offeror's price for the combination to be awarded is less than the price offered by any other responsive, responsible offeror.
                (c) Example: “The amount available is $100,000. Offeror A's base bid and four additives (in the order stated in the list of priorities in the bid schedule) are $85,000, $10,000, $8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. Offeror B's base bid and four additives are $80,000, $16,000, $9,000, $7,000, and $4,000. Offeror A is the low offeror. The aggregate amount of offeror A's bid for purposes of award would be $99,000, which includes a base bid plus the first and fourth additives. The second and third additives were skipped because each of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000.”

The Contractor and its health-care providers shall be liable for their liability-producing acts or omissions. The Contractor shall maintain or require all health-care providers performing under this contract to maintain, during the term of this contract, professional liability insurance issued by a responsible insurance carrier of not less than the following amount(s) per specialty per occurrence: [Contracting Officer's Note: Insert the dollar amount value(s) of standard coverage(s) prevailing within the local community as to the specific medical specialty, or specialties, concerned, or such higher amount as the Contracting Officer deems necessary to protect the Government's interests.] However, if the Contractor is an entity or a subdivision of a State that either provides for self-insurance or limits the liability or the amount of insurance purchased by State entities, then the insurance requirement of this contract shall be fulfilled by incorporating the provisions of the applicable State law.
                (b) An apparently successful offeror, upon request of the Contracting Officer, shall, prior to contract award, furnish evidence of the insurability of the offeror and/or of all health-care providers who will perform under this contract. The submission shall provide evidence of insurability concerning the medical liability insurance required by paragraph (a) of this clause or the provisions of State law as to self-insurance, or limitations on liability or insurance.
                (c) The Contractor shall, prior to commencement of services under the contract, provide to the Contracting Officer Certificates of Insurance or insurance policies evidencing the required insurance coverage and an endorsement stating that any cancellation or material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer.

                (d) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if it, or any of the health-care providers performing under this contract, change insurance providers during the performance period of this contract. The notification shall provide evidence that the Contractor and/or health-care providers will meet all the requirements of this clause, including those concerning liability insurance and endorsements. These requirements may be met either under the new policy, or a combination of old and new policies, if applicable.

                (e) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts for health-care services under this contract.

The Act also applies to all subcontracts awarded under this contract for the specified children's services. Accordingly, the Contractor shall ensure that each of its employees, and any subcontractor staff, is made aware of, understands, and complies with the provisions of the Act. Failure to comply with the Act may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity. Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate violation.

The Contracting Officer shall fill in the number of days in which a Contractor must assert its right to an equitable adjustment; however, such amount shall not exceed 60 calendar days.
              
                Construction Contract Changes—Supplement (SEP 2019)
                The FAR clauses 52.236-2, Differing Site Conditions; 52.243-4, Changes; and 52.243-5, Changes and Changed Conditions, are supplemented as follows:
                (a) Submission of request for equitable adjustment proposals. When directed by the Contracting Officer or requested by the Contractor, the Contractor shall, in accordance with FAR 15.403-5, submit proposals for changes in the work exceeding $500,000 in writing to the Contracting Officer or Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), and to the resident engineer.
                (1) The Contractor must provide an itemized breakdown for changes exceeding the micro-purchase threshold (see FAR 2.101).
                (2) The itemized breakdown shall include materials, quantities, unit prices, labor costs (separated into trades), construction equipment, etc. Labor costs shall be identified with specific material placed or operation performed.

                (3) Proposals shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer or ACO and the resident engineer as expeditiously as possible, but not later than [fill-in] calendar days, after receipt of a written change order by the Contracting Officer.
                (4) Proposals shall be signed by each subcontractor participating in the change.
                (5) The Contracting Officer will consider issuing a settlement by determination to the contract if the Contractor's proposal required by paragraph (a)(3) of this clause is not received within the time period specified in paragraph (a)(3), or if agreement has not been reached.
                (b) Paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this clause and the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) apply to proposals for changes in the work $500,000 or less:
                (1) As a basis for negotiation, allowances not to exceed 10 percent each for overhead and profit for the party performing the work will be based on the value of labor, material, and equipment required to accomplish the change. As the value of the change increases, a declining scale will be used in negotiating the percentage of overhead and profit. This declining scale will also be used to negotiate the prime Contractor's or upper-tier subcontractor's fee when work is performed by lower-tier subcontractors (to a maximum of three tiers) and will be based on the net increased cost to the prime or upper-tier subcontractor, as applicable. Profit (fee) shall be computed by multiplying the profit percentage by the sum of the direct costs and computed overhead costs. Allowable percentages on changes will not exceed the following:
                (i) 10 percent overhead and/or 10 percent profit (fee) on the first $20,000.
                (ii) 7.5 percent overhead and/or 7.5 percent profit (fee) on the next $30,000.
                (iii) 5 percent overhead and/or 5 percent profit (fee) on a balance over $50,000.
                (2) The Contracting Officer will consider issuing a settlement by determination to the contract if the Contractor's proposal required by paragraph (3) is not received within 30 calendar days, or if agreement has not been reached.

                (c)(1) Overhead and Contractor's fee percentages shall be considered to include insurance other than mentioned herein, field and office supervisors and assistants, security police, use of small tools, incidental job burdens, and general home office expenses and no separate allowance will be made. Assistants to office supervisors include all clerical, stenographic and general office help. Incidental job burdens include, but are not necessarily limited to, office equipment and supplies, temporary toilets, telephone and conformance to OSHA requirements. Items such as, but not necessarily limited to, review and coordination, estimating and expediting relative to contract changes are associated with field and office supervision and are considered to be included in the Contractor's overhead and/or fee percentage.
                
                (2) Where the Contractor's or subcontractor's portion of a change involves credit items, such items must be deducted prior to adding overhead and profit for the party performing the work. The Contractor's fee is limited to the net increase to Contractor or subcontractors' portions of cost computed in accordance with this clause.
                (3) Where a change involves credit items only, a proper measure of the amount of downward adjustment in the contract price is the reasonable cost to the Contractor if it had performed the deleted work. A reasonable allowance for overhead and profit are properly includable as part of the downward adjustment for a deductive change. The amount of such allowance is subject to negotiation.

                (b) Except when it is determined not to be in the Government's best interest, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are materially unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
                (c) If this solicitation is a request for proposals (RFP), a written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

                Award Without Exchanges (JAN 2003)
                The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without exchanges with offerors. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct exchanges if later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.

              871.100
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart sets forth policy and procedures with respect to the loan guaranty and direct loan programs as they pertain to property management, including the acquisition, management, and disposition of property, real, personal, or mixed, that were secured by loans guaranteed, insured, or made under Title 38, U.S.C.
            
            
              871.101
              Policy.
              All acquisitions for the repair and maintenance of VA property acquired under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 37 must be made in accordance with FAR parts 14, 15, and 16, parts 814, 815, and 816 of this chapter, and this subpart.
            
            
              871.102
              Authorization for repairs to properties.
              (a) Except as provided in this subpart, Directors, Loan Guaranty Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers, VA Regional Offices, are authorized to approve a repair program for any VA property acquired under Chapter 37, Title 38, U.S.C., if the cost does not exceed $25,000. A repair program means the aggregate amount of the proposed contracts that are contemplated in a property analysis by the Loan Guaranty activity.
              (b) In cases where the expenditure is known or estimated to exceed $25,000, the Loan Guaranty Officer, or his or her designee, must forward the request, together with the loan guaranty folder, to the Under Secretary for Benefits for approval.
              (c) During the period when VA has assumed custody of the property from a holder and before its conveyance to VA under 38 CFR 36.4320, repairs not in excess of $3,500 are authorized, when appropriate to make the property ready for sale at an earlier date than would otherwise be possible if the repair program was delayed until VA acquired absolute title. In cases where the expenditure is known or estimated to exceed $3,500, the Loan Guaranty Officer, or his or her designee, must forward the request, together with the loan guarantee folder, to the Under Secretary for Benefits for approval.

              (d) The holder must not make repairs to a property when it has continued custody, except for emergency repairs not in excess of $500, unless the holder gives adequate notice to the Director, Regional Office. Emergency repairs means immediate action to preserve the property from serious damage or to correct a situation imminently dangerous to life or limb, including the initial cleanup of the property to prevent the risk of damage by fire or vandalism.
              (e) An approved management broker may be authorized, when the property is assigned, to incur expenses for fuel and utilities or other recurring items that VA is required to furnish to its tenants or are required to maintain the property if the following conditions are met:
              (1) Advance blanket authorization to a management broker must be limited to repairs not in excess of $500 in any transaction.
              (2) The management broker must either submit receipts with an invoice or maintain receipts for inspection.
              (3) Expenditures in excess of $500 require prior approval of the Director, Regional Office, having jurisdiction of the property.
              (4) The management broker must aggregate the costs of repairs when determining whether prior approval is required.
            
            
              871.104
              Qualification of bidders.
              (a) Bidders must be qualified in accordance with procedures outlined in FAR subpart 9.1 and subpart 809.1 of this chapter.
              (b) Management brokers are not acceptable bidders for a repair contract due to their close association on a fee basis with VA. This restriction also applies to any contracting firm in which the management broker has an interest and in which it could be presumed that the firm would have an advantage over the other bidders. This does not preclude the management broker from performing routine recurring maintenance or minor repairs. When seeking payment for maintenance or repairs, the management broker must establish that any charges are not in excess of the prevailing fees for similar services in the area.
            
            
              871.106
              Lien waivers.
              (a) In a contract for $2,500 or more, the contracting officer must include the following requirements:
              (1) The contractor must sign a formal release in full or a lien waiver before payment may be made.
              (2) The contractor must notify the Director, Regional Office, of any subcontracts for services or materials in excess of $2,500. Each subcontractor must sign the release or waiver jointly with the prime contractor or exercise a release or waiver in the subcontractor's own name.
              (b) The contracting officer must not pay the contractor unless the release or waiver accompanies the contractor's invoice.
              (c) Before any authorized partial payment, the contractor must execute a release or waiver.
              (d) Due to the variations of local law, no standard release or waiver is prescribed. Each release or waiver must be prepared in accordance with local law and must be in form acceptable to the District Counsel.
            
            
              871.107
              Stipulations against liens.
              (a) In a contract for an amount less than $2,500, when determined necessary by the Director, Regional Office, the contracting officer may include the following:
              The contractor expressly waives any and all rights to file or maintain any mechanics lien or claim against the aforesaid premises.
              (b) In a contract for $2,500 or more when there is doubt that the final responsibility of the contractor will provide maximum protection to the Government, the contracting officer must include any requirements that are available under local law. The contracting officer must obtain advice and approval of any contract stipulation or legal stipulations against liens from the District Counsel.

              (a) Courses of instruction by correspondence means a course of education or training conducted by mail consisting of regular lessons or reading assignments, the preparation of required written work that involves the application of principles studied in each lesson, the correction of assigned work with such suggestions or recommendation as may be necessary to instruct the student, the keeping of student achievement records, and issuance of a diploma, certificate, or other evidence to the student upon satisfactorily completing the requirements of the course.
              (b) Special services or special courses. Special services or courses are those services or courses that VA requests that are supplementary to those the institution customarily provides for similarly circumstanced non-Veteran students and that the contracting officer considers to be necessary for the rehabilitation of the trainee.

              871.201-2
              Requirements when contracts are not required.
              (a) For the purpose of this section a contract is not required when all tuition, fees, and charges for books, supplies, or services necessary to train or educate an eligible veteran under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31 are published in the school catalog or other published document.
              (b) When a contract is not required, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Officer must obtain a signed statement of charges from the educational institution or training establishment for courses to be offered, including the rate of tuition, fees, and separate charges, if any, for books, supplies, and equipment handling charges, refund policy, and other provisions as are required to determine proper payment. The statement of charges may be in the form of a statement on VA Form 28-1905, Authorization and Certification of Entrance or Reentrance Into Rehabilitation and Certification Status, that charges will be in accordance with catalog or other published document (identify publication). The statement of charges may not exceed those charges nonveterans pay or that are published in the school catalog or other published document.
            
            
              871.201-3
              Medical services.
              The medical services provided trainees under vocational rehabilitation and education contracts, agreements, or arrangements are separate and distinct from any other medical service under the jurisdiction of the Veterans Health Administration to which the veteran may be entitled. No certificate of eligibility is required from the Veterans Health Administration before the veteran may be provided such services.
            
            
              871.201-4
              Letter contracts.

              Letter contracts are authorized for use in accordance with the provision of FAR 16.603 and in those cases in which it is not possible to complete a formal contract with an approved educational institution before the enrollment of eligible veterans for training.
            
            
              871.202
              Marking and release of supplies.
              The educational institution or training establishment is not required to mark supplies to indicate ownership by the United States. Supplies are considered to be the property of the trainee at the time they are furnished.
            
            
              871.203
              Renewals or supplements to contracts.
              Except for contracts for educational and vocational counseling, the contracting office may renew contracts from year to year by completing a renewal agreement no later than 30 days before the expiration of the contract. There must be no change in the schedule of provisions in the original contract.
              (a) Supplements may be negotiated at any time during the contract period upon the completion of the supplemental agreement.
              (b) Contracts for educational and vocational counseling may provide for automatic extension from year to year.
            
            
              871.204
              Guaranteed payment.
              A contracting officer may not award a contract or agreement to any institution or training establishment that requires VA is to pay a minimum charge, or to enroll a minimum number of participants per quarter, semester, term, course, or other period.
            
            
              871.205
              Proration of charges.
              A contract must include the exact formula agreed on for the proration of charges in the event that the veteran's program is interrupted or discontinued before the end of the term, semester, quarter, or other period, or the program is completed in less time than stated in the contract.
            
            
              871.206
              Other fees and charges.
              VA may pay fees and other charges that are not prescribed by law but are required by nongovernmental organizations, such as initiation fees required to become a member of a labor union and the dues necessary to maintain membership incidental to training on the job or to obtaining employment during a period in which the veteran is a chapter 31 participant, provided there are no facilities feasibly available where the necessary training can be feasibly accomplished or employment obtained without paying such charges. Payment for such fees must be made in accordance with Part 813.
            
            
              871.207
              Payment of tuition or fees.

              (2) An institution may be paid in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, if the institution operates on a regular term, quarter, or semester basis and normally accepts students only at the beginning of the term, quarter, or semester and if the institution is one of the following:
              (i) An institution of higher learning that uses a standard unit of credit recognized by accrediting associations. Such institutions include those that are members of recognized national or regional educational accrediting associations, and those that, although not members of such accrediting associations, grant standard units of credit acceptable at full value without examination by collegiate institutions that are members of national or regional accrediting associations.
              (ii) A public tax-supported institution.
              (iii) An institution operated and controlled by a State, county, or local board of education.
              (b) An institution that meets the exceptions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section and that has a refund policy providing for a graduated scale of charges for purposes of determining refunds may be paid part or all such tuitions or fees for a term, quarter, or other period of enrollment immediately following the date on which the refund expires.
              (c) Proration of charges does not apply to a fee for noncontinuing service, such as a registration fee, etc.

              (d) The period for which payment of charges may be made is the period of actual enrollment and is subject to the following:
              (1) The effective date is the date of the trainee's entrance into training status, except that payment may be made for an entire semester, quarter, or term in institutions operating on that basis if the trainee enters no later than the final date set by the institution for enrolling for full credit.
              (2) In those cases where the institution has not set a final date for enrolling for full credit or does not set a date acceptable to VA, payment may be prorated on the basis of attendance, regardless of the refund policy.
              (3) If an institution customarily charges for the amount of credit or number of hours of attendance for which a trainee enrolls, payment may be made on that basis when a trainee enrolls after the final date permitted for carrying full credit for the semester or term.
            
            
              871.208
              Rehabilitation facilities.
              Charges by rehabilitation facilities for the rehabilitation services provided under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31 are paid in the same manner as charges for educational and vocational services through contract, agreement, or other arrangement.
            
            
              871.209
              Records and reports.
              Contracts, agreements, or arrangements must provide for the number and frequency of reports, adequate financial records to support payment for each trainee, and maintenance of attendance and progress records. Such records must be preserved for a period of three years.
            
            
              871.210
              Correspondence courses.
              Contracts with institutions for correspondence courses must provide for the following:
              (a) Major changes in courses or course material are not binding on the VA until a supplemental agreement to the contract is negotiated.
              (b) Minor changes in course or course material not affecting the length of the course or number of lessons and not lowering the educational value of the course or the quality of the course material, such as revision of text, the substitution of a newer lesson for an older one, or the substitution of equipment of equal or greater value, are permitted without supplemental agreements. The institution must place such minor changes and revisions on file with the contracting officer at the time of the change or revision.
              (c) Trainees must be provided with prompt and adequate lessons service and, unless otherwise specified in the contract, must be furnished the same texts, lessons service, diplomas, and other services as are normally provided for regularly enrolled non-veteran students.
              (d) All lessons must be adequately serviced on an individual basis. Grouping of lessons into units or partial servicing does not meet this requirement.
              (e) Each lesson must have a separate examination that is adequate in terms of lesson content.
              (f) The training of persons under a VA contract or the fact that the United States is using the facilities of the institution for training veterans must not be used in any way to advertise the institution. References in the advertising media or correspondence of the institution shall be limited to a list of courses under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31 and must not be directed or pointed specifically to veterans.
              (g) The rates, fees, and charges must not be in excess of those charged nonveterans.
              (h) Payment must be made on a lesson-completed basis in areas for assignments sent in by trainees and serviced during a pay period as established by the contract.
              (i) Payment must be made only once for each lesson even though it is necessary to service a lesson more than once.

              Information concerning correspondence courses.
              Specific questions on correspondence courses as to the content of courses, academic credit, and entrance requirements for courses included in VA contracts may be directed to the institutions offering the courses.

            873.101
            Policy.
            The simplified acquisition procedures set forth in this Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) part apply to the acquisition of health-care resources consisting of commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space. These procedures shall be used in conjunction with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and other parts of the VAAR. However, when a policy or procedure in the FAR or another part of the VAAR differs from the procedures contained in this part, this part shall apply. These procedures contain more flexibility than provided in the FAR or elsewhere in the VAAR. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.102
            Definitions.
            
              Commercial service means a service, except construction exceeding $2,000 and architect-engineer services, that is offered and sold competitively in the commercial marketplace, is performed under standard commercial terms and conditions, and is procured using firm-fixed price contracts. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            
              Health-care providers include health-care plans and insurers and any organizations, institutions, or other entities or individuals who furnish health-care resources. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            
              Health-care resource includes hospital care and medical services (as those terms are defined in section 1701 of title 38 United States Code (U.S.C.)), any other health-care service, and any health-care support or administrative resource, including the use of medical equipment or space. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.103
            Priority sources.
            Without regard to FAR 8.002(a)(2), except for the acquisition of services available from the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, pursuant to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c) and FAR Subpart 8.7, there are no priority sources for the acquisition of health-care resources consisting of commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            
            873.104
            Competition requirements.
            (a) Without regard to FAR part 6, if the health-care resource required is a commercial service, the use of medical equipment or space, or research, and is to be acquired from an institution affiliated with the Department in accordance with section 7302 of title 38 U.S.C., including medical practice groups and other approved entities associated with affiliated institutions (entities will be approved if determined legally to be associated with affiliated institutions), or from blood banks, organ banks, or research centers, the resource may be acquired on a sole source basis. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) Acquisition of health-care resources identified in paragraph (a) of this section are not required to be publicized as otherwise required by 873.108 or FAR 5.101. In addition, written justification, as otherwise set forth in section 303(f) of the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253(f)) and FAR part 6, is not required. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) Without regard to FAR 6.101, if the health-care resource required is a commercial service or the use of medical equipment or space, and is to be acquired from an entity not described in paragraph (a) of this section, contracting officers must seek competition to the maximum extent practicable and must permit all responsible sources, as appropriate under the provisions of this part, to submit a bid, proposal or quotation (as appropriate) for the resources to be procured and provide for the consideration by the Department of bids, proposals, or quotations so submitted. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (d) Without regard to FAR 5.101, acquisition of health-care resources identified in paragraph (c) of this section shall be publicized as otherwise required by 873.108. Moreover, for any such acquisition described in paragraph (c) of this section to be conducted on a sole source basis, the contracting officer must prepare a justification that includes the information and is approved at the levels prescribed in section 303(f) of the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253(f)) and FAR part 6. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.105
            Acquisition planning.
            (a) Acquisition planning is an indispensable component of the total acquisition process.
            (b) For the acquisition of health-care resources consisting of commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space, where the acquisition is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), an acquisition team must be assembled. The team shall be tailored by the contracting officer for each particular acquisition expected to exceed the SAT. The team should consist of a mix of staff, appropriate to the complexity of the acquisition, and may include contracting, fiscal, legal, administrative, and technical personnel, and such other expertise as necessary to assure a comprehensive acquisition plan. The team should include the small business advocate representing the contracting activity or a higher level designee and the SBA Procurement Center Representative (PRC), if available. As a minimum, the team must include the contracting officer and a representative of the requesting service. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) Prior to determining whether a requirement is suitable for acquisition using these simplified acquisition procedures, the contracting officer or the acquisition team, as appropriate, must conduct market research to identify interested businesses. It is the responsibility of the contracting officer to ensure the requirement is appropriately publicized and information about the procurement opportunity is adequately disseminated as set forth in 873.108. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (d) In lieu of the requirements of FAR part 7 addressing documentation of the acquisition plan, the contracting officer may conduct an acquisition strategy meeting with cognizant offices to seek approval for the proposed acquisition approach. If a meeting is conducted, briefing materials shall be presented to address the acquisition plan topics and structure in FAR 7.105. Formal written minutes—summarizing decisions, actions, and conclusions—shall be prepared and included in the contract file, along with a copy of the briefing materials. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            
            873.106
            Presolicitation exchanges with industry.
            (a) This section shall be used in lieu of FAR part 10, except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. In conducting market research, exchange of information by all interested parties involved in an acquisition, from the earliest identification of a requirement through release of the solicitation, is encouraged. Interested parties include potential offerors, end users, Government acquisition and support personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of the acquisition. The nature and extent of presolicitation exchanges between the Government and industry shall be a matter of the contracting officer's discretion (for acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) or the acquisition team's discretion, as coordinated by the contracting officer. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) Techniques to promote early exchange of information include—
            (1) Industry or small business conferences;
            (2) Public hearings;
            (3) Market research in accordance with FAR 10.002(b), which shall be followed to the extent that the provisions therein would provide relevant information;
            (4) One-on-one meetings with potential offerors;
            (5) Presolicitation notices;
            (6) Draft requests for proposals (RFPs);
            (7) Requests for information (RFIs);
            (8) Presolicitation or preproposal conferences;
            (9) Site visits;
            (10) Electronic notices (e.g., Internet); and

            (11) Use of the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). (http://www.bpn.gov/ccrinq/scripts/search.asp) and the “Advanced Search” feature on VetBiz Vendor Information Pages (http://vip.vetbiz.gov/general_user/search/default.asp) to search for vendors.

            873.107
            Socioeconomic programs.
            (a) Implementation. This section provides additional authority, over and above that found at FAR 19.502, to waive small business set-asides. For acquisitions above the micro-purchase threshold, if, through market research, the contracting officer determines that there is reasonable expectation that reasonably priced bids, proposals, or quotations will be received from two or more responsible small businesses, a requirement for health-care resources must be reserved for small business participation. Without regard to FAR 13.003(b)(1), 19.502-2, and 19.502-3, the head of the contracting activity (HCA) may approve a waiver from the requirement for any set-aside for small business participation when a waiver is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) Rejecting Small Business Administration (SBA) recommendations. (1) The contracting officer (or, if a waiver has been approved in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the HCA) must consider and respond to a recommendation from an SBA representative to set a procurement aside for small business within 5 working days. If the recommendation is rejected by the contracting officer (or, if a waiver has been approved, by the HCA) and if SBA intends to appeal that determination, SBA must, within 2 working days after receipt of the determination, notify the contracting officer involved of SBA's intention to appeal.
            (2) Upon receipt of the notification of SBA's intention to appeal and pending issuance of a final Department appeal decision to SBA, the contracting officer involved must suspend action on the acquisition unless the contracting officer makes a determination in writing that proceeding to contract award and performance is in the public interest. The contracting officer must promptly notify SBA of the determination to proceed with the solicitation and/or contract award and must provide a copy of the written determination to SBA.

            (3) SBA shall be allowed 10 working days after receiving the rejection notice from the contracting officer (or the HCA, if a waiver has been approved) for acquisitions not exceeding $5 million, or 15 working days after receiving the rejection notice for acquisitions exceeding $5 million, to file an appeal. SBA must notify the contracting officer within this 10 or 15 day period whether an appeal has, in fact, been taken. If notification is not received by the contracting officer within the applicable period, it shall be deemed that an appeal was not taken.
            (4) SBA shall submit appeals to the Secretary. Decisions shall be made by the DSPE, whose decisions shall be final. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) Contracting with the Small Business Administration (the 8(a) Program). The procedures of FAR 19.8 shall be followed where a responsible 8(a) contractor has been identified.
            (d) Certificates of competency and determinations of responsibility. The Director, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Assistant Administrator, Office of Industrial Assistance, Small Business Administration (SBA), shall serve as ombudsmen to assist VA contracting officers on any issues relating to Certificates of Competency (COC). Copies of all COC referrals to SBA shall be submitted to the Director, OSDBU (00SB).
          
          
            873.108
            Publicizing contract actions.
            (a) Without regard to FAR 5.101, all acquisitions under this part 873, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, for dollar amounts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), as set forth in FAR Part 13, shall be publicly announced utilizing a medium designed to obtain competition to the maximum extent practicable and to permit all responsible sources, as appropriate under the provisions of this part, to submit a bid, proposal, or quotation (as appropriate).
            (1) The publication medium may include the Internet, including the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE), and local, regional or national publications or journals, as appropriate, at the discretion of the contracting officer, depending on the complexity of the acquisition.
            (2) Without regard to FAR 5.203, notice shall be published for a reasonable time prior to issuance of a request for quotations (RFQ) or a solicitation, depending on the complexity or urgency of the acquisition, in order to afford potential offerors a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the notice includes a complete copy of the RFQ or solicitation, a prior notice is not required, and the RFQ or solicitation shall be considered to be announced and issued at the same time.
            (3) The notice may include contractor qualification parameters, such as time for delivery of service, credentialing or medical certification requirements, small business or other socio-economic preferences, the appropriate small business size standard, and such other qualifications as the contracting officer deems necessary to meet the needs of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) The requirement for public announcement does not apply to sole source acquisitions, described in 873.104(a), from institutions affiliated with the Department in accordance with section 7302 of title 38 U.S.C., including medical practice groups and other approved entities associated with affiliated institutions (entities will be approved if determined legally to be associated with affiliated institutions), or from blood banks, organ banks, or research centers. In addition, the requirement for public announcement does not apply to sole source acquisitions of hospital care and medical services (as those terms are defined in section 1701 of title 38 U.S.C.) or any other health-care services, including acquisitions for the mutual use or exchange of use of such services. However, as required by 38 U.S.C. 8153(a)(3)(D), acquisitions from non-affiliates, if conducted on a sole source basis, must still be justified and approved (see 873.104(d)). (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) For acquisitions below the SAT, a public announcement is optional. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (d) Each solicitation issued under these procedures must prominently identify that the requirement is being solicited under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8153 and part 873. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.109
            General requirements for acquisition of health-care resources.
            (a) Source selection authority. Contracting officers shall be the source selection authority for acquisitions of health-care resources, consisting of commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space, utilizing the guidance contained in this part 873. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) Statement of work/Specifications. Statements of work or specifications must define the requirement and should, in most instances, include qualifications or limitations such as time limits for delivery of service, medical certification or credentialing restrictions, and small business or other socio-economic preferences. The contracting officer may include any other such terms as the contracting officer deems appropriate for each specific acquisition. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) Documentation. Without regard to FAR 13.106-3(b), 13.501(b), or 15.406-3, the contract file must include:
            (1) A brief written description of the procedures used in awarding the contract;
            (2) The market research, including the determination that the acquisition involves health-care resources;
            (3) The number of offers received; and
            (4) An explanation, tailored to the size and complexity of the acquisition, of the basis for the contract award decision. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (d) Time for receipt of quotations or offers. (1) Without regard to FAR 5.203, contracting officers shall set a reasonable time for receipt of quotations or proposals in requests for quotations (RFQs) and solicitations.
            (2) Without regard to FAR 15.208 or 52.212-1(f), quotations or proposals received after the time set forth in an RFQ or request for proposals (RFP) may be considered at the discretion of the contracting officer if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Contracting officers must document the rationale for accepting quotations or proposals received after the time specified in the RFQ or RFP. This paragraph (d)(2) shall not apply to RFQs or RFPs if alternative evaluation techniques described in 873.111(e)(1)(ii) are used. This paragraph (d)(2) does not apply to invitations for bid (IFBs). (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (e) Cancellation of procurements. Without regard to FAR 14.404-1, any acquisition may be canceled by the contracting officer at any time during the acquisition process if cancellation is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.110
            Solicitation provisions.
            (a) As provided in 873.109(d), contracting officers shall insert the provision at 852.273-70, Late offers, in all requests for quotations (RFQs) and requests for proposals (RFPs) exceeding the micro-purchase threshold. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) The contracting officer shall insert a provision in RFQs and solicitations, substantially the same as the provision at 852.273-71, Alternative negotiation techniques, when either of the alternative negotiation techniques described in 873.111(e)(1) will be used. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 852.273-72, Alternative evaluation, in lieu of the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation—Commercial Items, when the alternative negotiation technique described in 873.111(e)(1)(ii) will be used. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (d) When evaluation information, as described in 873.112, is to be used to select a contractor under an RFQ or RFP for health-care resources consisting of commercial services or the use of medical equipment or space, the contracting officer may insert the provision at 852.273-73, Evaluation—health-care resources, in the RFQ or RFP in lieu of FAR provision 52.212-2. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (e) As provided at 873.113(f), if award may be made without exchange with vendors, the contracting officer shall include the provision at 852.273-74, Award without exchanges, in the RFQ or RFP. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (f) The contracting officer shall insert the FAR clause at 52.207-3, Right of First Refusal of Employment, and the clause at 852.207-70, Report of employment under commercial activities, in all RFQs, solicitations, and contracts issued under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8151-8153 which may result in a conversion, from in-house performance to contract performance, of work currently being performed by Department of Veterans Affairs employees. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.111
            Acquisition strategies for health-care resources.

            Without regard to FAR 13.003 or 13.500(a), the following acquisition processes and techniques may be used, singly or in combination with others, as appropriate, to design acquisition strategies suitable for the complexity of the requirement and the amount of resources available to conduct the acquisition. These strategies should be considered during acquisition planning. The contracting officer shall select the process most appropriate to the particular acquisition. There is no preference for sealed bid acquisitions. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (a) Request for quotations. (1) Without regard to FAR 6.1 or 6.2, contracting officers must solicit a sufficient number of sources to promote competition to the maximum extent practicable and to ensure that the purchase is advantageous to the Government, based, as appropriate, on either price alone or price and other factors (e.g., past performance and quality). RFQs must notify vendors of the basis upon which the award is to be made.
            (2) For acquisitions in excess of the SAT, the procedures set forth in FAR Part 13 concerning RFQs may be utilized without regard to the dollar thresholds contained therein. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) Sealed bidding. FAR Part 14 provides procedures for sealed bidding.
            (c) Negotiated acquisitions. If the procedures of FAR Parts 12, 13, and 15 differ from the procedures of this Part, the procedures of this Part shall take precedence. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (d) Multiphase acquisition technique. (1) General. Without regard to FAR 15.202, multiphase acquisitions may be appropriate when the submission of full proposals at the beginning of an acquisition would be burdensome for offerors to prepare and for Government personnel to evaluate. Using multiphase techniques, the Government may seek limited information initially, make one or more down-selects, and request a full proposal from an individual offeror or limited number of offerors. Provided that the notice notifies offerors, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals during any phase to the number that will permit an efficient competition among proposals offering the greatest likelihood of award. The contracting officer may indicate in the notice an estimate of the greatest number of proposals that will be included in the down-select phase. The contracting officer may down-select to a single offeror.
            (2) First phase notice. In the first phase, the Government shall publish a notice (see 873.108) that solicits responses and that may provide, as appropriate, a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisition and the criteria that will be used to make the initial down-select decision. The notice may also inform offerors of the evaluation criteria or process that will be used in subsequent down-select decisions. The notice must contain sufficient information to allow potential offerors to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition. The notice must advise offerors that failure to participate in the first phase will make them ineligible to participate in subsequent phases. The notice may be in the form of a synopsis in the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) or a narrative letter or other appropriate method that contains the information required by this paragraph.
            (3) First phase responses. Offerors shall submit the information requested in the notice described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Information sought in the first phase may be limited to a statement of qualifications and other appropriate information (e.g., proposed technical concept, past performance information, limited pricing information).
            (4) First phase evaluation and down-select. The Government shall evaluate all offerors' submissions in accordance with the notice and make a down-select decision.
            (5) Subsequent phases. Additional information shall be sought in the second phase so that a down-select can be performed or an award made without exchanges, if necessary. The contracting officer may conduct exchanges with remaining offeror(s), request proposal revisions, or request best and final offers, as determined necessary by the contracting officer, in order to make an award decision.
            (6) Debriefing. Without regard to FAR 15.505, contracting officers must debrief offerors as required by 873.118 when they have been excluded from the competition. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (e) Alternative negotiation techniques. (1) Contracting officers may utilize alternative negotiation techniques for the acquisition of health-care resources. Alternative negotiation techniques may be used when award will be based on either price or price and other factors. Alternative negotiation techniques include but are not limited to:
            (i) Indicating to offerors a price, contract term or condition, commercially available feature, and/or requirement (beyond any requirement or target specified in the solicitation) that offerors will have to improve upon or meet, as appropriate, in order to remain competitive.
            (ii) Posting offered prices electronically or otherwise (without disclosing the identity of the offerors) and permitting revisions of offers based on this information.
            (2) Except as otherwise permitted by law, contracting officers shall not conduct acquisitions under this section in a manner that reveals the identities of offerors, releases proprietary information, or otherwise gives any offeror a competitive advantage (see FAR 3.104). (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.112
            Evaluation information.
            (a) Without regard to FAR 15.304 (except for 15.304(c)(1) and (c)(3), which do apply to acquisitions under this authority), the criteria, factors, or other evaluation information that apply to an acquisition, and their relative importance, are within the broad discretion of agency acquisition officials as long as the evaluation information is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) Price or cost to the Government must be evaluated in every source selection. Past performance shall be evaluated in source selections for negotiated competitive acquisitions exceeding the SAT unless the contracting officer documents that past performance is not an appropriate evaluation factor for the acquisition. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) The quality of the product or service may be addressed in source selection through consideration of information such as past compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications, and prior experience. The information required from quoters, bidders, or offerors shall be included in notices or solicitations, as appropriate. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (d) The relative importance of any evaluation information included in a solicitation must be set forth therein. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.113
            Exchanges with offerors.
            (a) Without regard to FAR 15.201 or 15.306, negotiated acquisitions generally involve exchanges between the Government and competing offerors. Open exchanges support the goal of efficiency in Government by providing the Government with relevant information (in addition to that submitted in the offeror's initial proposal) needed to understand and evaluate the offeror's proposal. The nature and extent of exchanges between the Government and offerors is a matter of contracting officer judgment. Clarifications, communications, and discussions, as provided for in the FAR, are concepts not applicable to acquisitions under this part 873. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) Exchanges with potential offerors may take place throughout the source selection process. Exchanges may start in the planning stages and continue through contract award. Exchanges should occur most often with offerors determined to be in the best value pool (see 873.114). The purpose of exchanges is to ensure there is mutual understanding between the Government and the offerors on all aspects of the acquisition, including offerors' submittals/proposals. Information disclosed as a result of oral or written exchanges with an offeror may be considered in the evaluation of an offeror's proposal. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) Exchanges may be conducted, in part, to obtain information that explains or resolves ambiguities or other concerns (e.g., perceived errors, perceived omissions, or perceived deficiencies) in an offeror's proposal. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

            (d) Exchanges shall only be initiated if authorized by the contracting officer and need not be conducted with all offerors. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            
            (e) Except for acquisitions based on alternative negotiation techniques contained in 873.111(e)(1), the contracting officer and other Government personnel involved in the acquisition shall not disclose information regarding one offeror's proposal to other offerors without consent of the offeror in accordance with FAR parts 3 and 24. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (f) Award may be made on initial proposals without exchanges if the solicitation states that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without exchanges, unless the contracting officer determines that exchanges are considered necessary. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.114
            Best value pool.
            (a) Without regard to FAR 15.306(c), the contracting officer may determine the most highly rated proposals having the greatest likelihood of award based on the information or factors and subfactors in the solicitation. These vendors constitute the best value pool. This determination is within the sole discretion of the contracting officer. Competitive range determinations, as provided for in the FAR, are not applicable to acquisitions under this part 873. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) In planning an acquisition, the contracting officer may determine that the number of proposals that would otherwise be included in the best value pool is expected to exceed the number at which an efficient, timely, and economical competition can be conducted. In reaching such a conclusion, the contracting officer may consider such factors as the results of market research, historical data from previous acquisitions for similar services, and the resources available to conduct the source selection. Provided the solicitation notifies offerors that the best value pool can be limited for purposes of making an efficient, timely, and economical award, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the best value pool to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the proposals offering the greatest likelihood of award. The contracting officer may indicate in the solicitation the estimate of the greatest number of proposals that will be included in the best value pool. The contracting officer may limit the best value pool to a single offeror. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) If the contracting officer determines that an offeror's proposal is no longer in the best value pool, the proposal shall no longer be considered for award. Written notice of this decision must be provided to unsuccessful offerors at the earliest practicable time. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.115
            Proposal revisions.
            (a) Without regard to FAR 15.307, the contracting officer may request proposal revisions as often as needed during the proposal evaluation process at any time prior to award from vendors remaining in the best value pool. Proposal revisions shall be submitted in writing. The contracting officer may establish a common cutoff date for receipt of proposal revisions. Contracting officers may request best and final offers. In any case, contracting officers and acquisition team members must safeguard proposals, and revisions thereto, to avoid unfair dissemination of an offeror's proposal. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) If an offeror initially included in the best value pool is no longer considered to be among those most likely to receive award after submission of proposal revisions and subsequent evaluation thereof, the offeror may be eliminated from the best value pool without being afforded an opportunity to submit further proposal revisions. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) Requesting and/or receiving proposal revisions does not necessarily conclude exchanges. However, requests for proposal revisions should advise offerors that the Government may make award without obtaining further revisions. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.116
            Source selection decision.

            (a) An integrated comparative assessment of proposals should be performed before source selection is made. The contracting officer shall independently determine which proposal(s) represents the best value, consistent with the evaluation information or factors and subfactors in the solicitation, and that the prices are fair and reasonable. The contracting officer may determine that all proposals should be rejected if it is in the best interest of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) The source selection team, or advisory boards or panels, may conduct comparative analysis(es) of proposals and make award recommendations, if the contracting officer requests such assistance. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) The source selection decision must be documented in accordance with FAR 15.308.
          
          
            873.117
            Award to successful offeror.
            (a) The contracting officer shall award a contract to the successful offeror by furnishing the contract or other notice of the award to that offeror. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (b) If a request for proposal (RFP) process was used for the solicitation and if award is to be made without exchanges, the contracting officer may award a contract without obtaining the offeror's signature a second time. The offeror's signature on the offer constitutes the offeror's agreement to be bound by the offer. If a request for quotation (RFQ) process was used for the solicitation, and if the contracting officer determines there is a need to establish a binding contract prior to commencement of work, the contracting officer should obtain the offeror's acceptance signature on the contract to ensure formation of a binding contract. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (c) If the award document includes information that is different than the latest signed offer, both the offeror and the contracting officer must sign the contract award. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
            (d) When an award is made to an offeror for less than all of the items that may be awarded and additional items are being withheld for subsequent award, each notice shall state that the Government may make subsequent awards on those additional items within the offer acceptance period. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
          
          
            873.118
            Debriefings.
            Offerors excluded from a request for proposals (RFP) may submit a written request for a debriefing to the contracting officer. Without regard to FAR 15.505, preaward debriefings may be conducted by the contracting officer when determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Post-award debriefings shall be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.506. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

              Other issuances related to acquisition.

              (a) In addition to the FAR and DEAR, there are other issuances which deal with acquisition. Among these are the Federal Property Management Regulation, the Federal Management Regulation, the DOE Property Management Regulation, and DOE Directives. The Department also maintains the DOE Acquisition Guide (“the Guide”), which has procedural guidance for the acquisition community. The DOE Acquisition Guide serves this purpose by identifying relevant internal standard operating procedures to be followed by both procurement and program personnel who are involved in various aspects of the acquisition process. The Guide also is intended to be a repository of best practices found throughout the agency that reflect specific illustrations of techniques which might be helpful to all readers. The Guide is at http://management.energy.gov/policy_guidance/Acquisition_Guide.htm.

              (a) Contracting authority for DOE vests in the Secretary of Energy, and for NNSA in the Administrator.
              (1) The Secretary has delegated this authority to the DOE Senior Procurement Executive.

The NNSA Administrator has delegated this authority, with specific dollar limitations and conditions to the NNSA Senior Procurement Executive. The NNSA Senior Procurement Executive has redelegated this authority to the NNSA Head of the Contracting Activities (HCA). Each NNSA HCA in turn makes formal contracting officer appointments for its contracting activity.
              (b) The Senior Procurement Executives have been authorized, without power of redelegation, to perform the functions set forth at 48 CFR 1.601(b) regarding the assignment of contracting functions and responsibilities to another agency, and the creation of joint or combined offices with another agency to exercise acquisition functions and responsibilities.

              This subpart implements the DOE Contractor Employee Protection Program as set forth at 10 CFR part 708. Part 708 establishes criteria and procedures for the investigation, hearing, and review of allegations from DOE contractor employees of employer reprisal resulting from employee disclosure of information to DOE, to Members of Congress, or to the contractor; employee participation in proceedings before Congress or pursuant to this subpart; or employee refusal to engage in illegal or dangerous activities, when such disclosure, participation, or refusal pertains to employer practices which the employee believes to be unsafe; to violate laws, rules, or regulations; or to involve fraud, mismanagement, waste, or abuse.

              10 CFR part 708 is applicable to complaints of retaliation filed by employees of contractors, and subcontractors, performing work on behalf of DOE directly related to DOE-owned or leased facilities, if the complaint stems from a disclosure, participation, or refusal described in 10 CFR 708.5.

              Remedies.
              (a) Contractors found to have retaliated against an employee in reprisal for such disclosure, participation or refusal are required to provide relief in accordance with decisions issued under 10 CFR part 708.
              (b) 10 CFR part 708 provides that for the purposes of the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 605 and 606), a final decision issued pursuant to 10 CFR part 708 shall not be considered to be a claim by the Government against a contractor or a decision by the contracting officer subject to appeal. However, a contractor's disagreement and refusal to comply with a final decision could result in a contracting officer's decision to disallow certain costs or to terminate the contract for default. In such case, the contractor could file a claim under the Disputes clause of the contract regarding the disallowance of cost or the termination of the contract.

              904.402
              General.
              (a) The basis of Department of Energy's (DOE) industrial security requirements is the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and Executive Orders 12958 and 12829.
              (b) DOE security regulations concerning restricted data are codified at 10 CFR part 1045.
              (c)(1) Section 234B of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2282b) requires that DOE contracts include a clause that provides for an appropriate reduction in the fees or amounts paid to the contractor under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any rule, regulation, or order relating to the safeguarding or security of Restricted Data or other classified information. The clause is required for all DOE prime contracts that involve any possibility of contractor access to Restricted Data or other classified information. The clause is required to specify various degrees of violations and the amount of the reduction attributable to each degree of violation. The clause prescribed at 904.404(d)(6) (952.204-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information) or the clause prescribed at 923.7003(f) (952.223-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health) shall be used for this purpose unless the clause prescribed at 970.1504-5(b)(1) (970.5215-3, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts) is used.

              (2) The 952.204-76 clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information” and the 952.223-76 clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health” provide for reductions of fee or profit that is earned by the contractor depending upon the severity of the contractor's failure to comply with contract terms or conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a reduction of earned fee, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are specified in the clause.
              (3) The contracting officer must obtain the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity—
              (i) Prior to effecting any reduction of fee or amounts otherwise payable to the contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 952.204-76 clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information” or of the 952.223-76 clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health;” and
              (ii) For determinations that no reduction of fee is warranted for a particular performance failure(s) that would otherwise warrant a reduction.

              Solicitation provision and contract clause.
              (d) The security clauses to be used in DOE contracts are found at 952.204. They are:
              (1) Security, 952.204-2. This clause is required in contracts and subcontracts, the performance of which involves or is likely to involve classified information, access to special nuclear materials or the provision of protective services. DOE utilizes the National Industrial Security Program but DOE's security authority is derived from the Atomic Energy Act which contains specific language not found in other agencies' authorities. For this reason, DOE contracts must contain the clause at 952.204-2 rather than the clause at 48 CFR 52.204-2.
              (2) Classification/Declassification, 952.204-70. This clause is to be used in all contracts which involve classified information.
              (3) Sensitive foreign nation controls, 952.204-71. This clause is required in unclassified research contracts which may involve making unclassified information about nuclear technology available to certain sensitive foreign nations.

(The attachment referred to in the clause shall set forth the applicable requirements of the DOE regulations on dissemination of unclassified published and unpublished technical information to foreign nations.)
              (4) Disclosure of information, 952.204-72. This clause may be used in place of the clauses entitled “Security” and “Classification” in contracts with educational institutions for research work performed in their own institute facilities that are not likely to produce classified information.
              (5) Facility Clearance, 952.204-73. This solicitation provision should be used in solicitations expected to result in contracts and subcontracts that require employees to possess access authorizations.
              (6) Except as prescribed in 970.1504-5(b), the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.204-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health, in all contracts that contain the clause at 952.204-2, Security, but that do not contain the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement.
              (7) Computer Security, 952.204-77. This clause is required in contracts in which the contractor may have access to computers owned, leased or operated on behalf of the Department of Energy.

              904.7000
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart sets forth the Department of Energy policies and procedures regarding Facility Clearances for contractors and subcontractors that require access to classified information or special nuclear material. A Facility Clearance is based upon a determination that satisfactory safeguards and security measures are carried out for classified activities being performed at the facility and upon a favorable foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) determination.

              904.7001
              Applicability.
              The provisions of this subpart shall apply to all offeror(s), contractors, and subcontractors who will or do have access to classified information or a significant quantity of special nuclear material.
              [49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994; 76 FR 7690, Feb. 11, 2011]
            
            
              904.7002
              Definitions.
              
                Contract means the prime contract and the subcontract at any tier.
              
                Contracting officer means the DOE contracting officer.
              
                Contractor means the contractor and the subcontractor at any tier.
              
                Facility clearance means an administrative determination that a facility is eligible to access, produce, use, or store classified information, or special nuclear material.
              
                Foreign interest means any of the following—
              (1) Foreign government or foreign government agency or instrumentality thereof;
              (2) Any form of business enterprise organized under the laws of any country other than the United States or its possessions;
              (3) Any form of business enterprise organized or incorporated under the laws of the U.S., or a State or other jurisdiction within the U.S. which is owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign government, agency, firm, corporation, or person; or
              (4) Any person who is not a U.S. citizen.
              
                Foreign ownership, control, or influence means the situation where the degree of ownership, control, or influence over an offeror(s) or a contractor by a foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists for concluding that compromise of classified information or special nuclear material may possibly result.
              
                Special nuclear material means special nuclear material as defined in 10 CFR 710.5(a).
              [49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994; 67 FR 14876, Mar. 28, 2002; 74 FR 36361, July 22, 2009; 76 FR 7690, Feb. 11, 2011]
            
            
              904.7003
              Disclosure of foreign ownership, control, or influence.
              (a) If a contract requires a contractor to have a Facility Clearance, DOE must determine whether the contractor is or may be subject to foreign ownership, control or influence before a contract can be awarded.
              (b) If, during the performance of a contract, the contractor comes under FOCI, then the DOE must determine whether a continuation of the Facility Clearance may pose an undue risk to the common defense and security through the possible compromise of that information or material. If the DOE determines that such a threat or potential threat exists, the contracting officer shall consider the alternatives of negotiating an acceptable method of isolating the foreign interest which owns, controls, or influences the contractor or terminating the contract.
              (c) It is essential for the DOE to obtain information about FOCI which is sufficient to help the Department determine whether award of a contract to a person or firm, or the continued performance of a contract by a person or firm, may pose undue risk to the common defense and security. Therefore, the provision specified at 952.204-73 Facility Clearance, shall be included in solicitations that involve offeror(s) or contractors that are subject to 904.7001.
              (d) The contracting officer shall not award or extend any contract subject to this subpart, exercise any options under a contract, modify any contracts subject to this subpart, or approve or consent to a subcontract subject to this subpart unless—
              (1) The contractor provides the information required by the solicitation provision at 952.204-73 Facility Clearance, and
              (2) The contracting officer has made a positive determination in accordance with 904.7004.

              904.7004
              Findings, determination, and contract award or termination.
              (a) Based on the information disclosed by the offeror(s) or contractor, and after consulting with the DOE Office of Safeguards and Security, the contracting officer must determine that award of a contract to an offeror(s) or continued performance of a contract by a contractor will not pose an undue risk to the common defense and security. The contracting officer need not prepare a separate finding and determination addressing FOCI; however, the memorandum of negotiation shall include a discussion of the applicability of this subpart and the resulting determination.

              (b) In those cases where FOCI does exist, and the DOE determines that an undue risk to the common defense and security may exist, the offeror(s) or contractor shall be requested to propose within a prescribed period of time a plan of action to avoid or mitigate the foreign influences by isolation of the foreign interest.
              (c) The types of plans that a contractor can propose are: measures which provide for physical or organizational separation of the facility or organizational component containing the classified information or special nuclear material; modification or termination of agreements with foreign interests; diversification or reduction of foreign source income; assignment of specific security duties and responsibilities to board members or special executive level committees; or any other actions to negate or reduce FOCI to acceptable levels. The plan of action may vary with the type of foreign interest involved, degree of ownership, and information involved so that each plan must be negotiated on a case by case basis. If the offeror(s) or contractor and the DOE cannot negotiate a plan of action that isolates the offeror(s) or contractor from FOCI satisfactory to the DOE, then the offeror(s) shall not be considered for contract award and affected existing contracts with a contractor shall be terminated.

              Vehicles may be acquired by DOE activities directly rather than through GSA when a waiver has been granted by GSA. A copy of the activity's request to GSA for a waiver shall be forwarded to the Director, Personal Property Policy Division, within the Headquarters procurement organization. In cases involving general purpose vehicles where GSA refuses to grant a waiver and where it is believed that acquisition through GSA would adversely affect or otherwise impair the program, authority for direct acquisition shall be obtained from the above-mentioned Headquarters official, prior to acquisition. In the acquisition of special purpose vehicles for use by DOE and its authorized contractors, the Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize direct purchases. The purchase price for sedans and station wagons, shall not exceed any statutory limitation in effect at the time the acquisition is made. (See 41 CFR 109-26.501-1).

              (b) The Heads of Contracting Activities may arrange to sell, as exchange sales, used motor vehicles being replaced and to apply the proceeds to the purchase of similar new vehicles. However, in the event personnel are not available to make such sales, or it is in the best interest of the DOE office, GSA may be requested to sell the used vehicles.

However, the Heads of Contracting Activities may authorize the purchase of used vehicles where justified by special circumstances; e.g., when new vehicles are in short supply, the vehicles are to be used for experimental or test purposes, or the vehicles are acquired from exchange sale. In accordance with 41 CFR 109-26.501-50 and 109-26.501-51, the statutory passenger vehicle allocation requirements for DOE shall apply to any purchase of used vehicles except in the case of vehicles to be used exclusively for experimental or test purposes.

              909.406-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. (1) Offices responsible for the award and administration of contracts are responsible for reporting to the appropriate Senior Procurement Executive and the DOE Inspector General information about possible fraud, waste, abuse, or other wrongdoing which may constitute or contribute to a cause(s) for debarment under this subpart. Circumstances that involve possible criminal or fraudulent activities must be reported to the Office of the Inspector General in accordance with 10 CFR part 1010, Conduct of Employees, § 1010.103, Reporting Wrongdoing.
              (2) At a minimum, referrals for consideration of debarment action should be in writing and should include the following information—
              (i) The recommendation and rationale for the referral;
              (ii) A statement of facts;
              (iii) Copies of documentary evidence and a list of all witnesses, including addresses and telephone numbers, together with a statement concerning their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and the subject matter of their testimony;
              (iv) A list of parties including the contractor, principals, and affiliates (including last known home and business addresses, zip codes and DUNS Number or other identifying number for an individual);
              (v) DOE's and NNSA's acquisition history with the contractor, including recent experience under contracts and copies of pertinent contracts;
              (vi) A list of any known active or potential criminal investigations, criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims before the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or other fact-finding body; and
              (vii) A statement regarding the impact of the debarment action on DOE and NNSA programs. This statement is not required for referrals by the Inspector General.
              (3) Referrals may be returned to the originator for further information or development.
              (b) Decisionmaking process. Contractors proposed for debarment shall be afforded an opportunity to submit information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment.
              (1) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Debarring Official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submissions made by the contractor. If the respondent fails to submit a timely written response to a notice of proposed debarment, the Debarring Official shall notify the respondent in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(e) that the contractor is debarred.
              (2) In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the contractor may request a fact-finding hearing to resolve a genuine dispute of material fact. In its request, the contractor must identify the material facts in dispute and the basis for disputing the facts. If the Debarring Official determines that there is a genuine dispute of material fact, the Debarring Official shall appoint, and refer the matter to, a Fact-Finding Official for a fact-finding conference.
              (3) Meeting. Upon receipt of a timely request from a contractor proposed for debarment, the Debarring Official shall schedule a meeting between the Debarring Official and the respondent, to be held no later than 30 days from the date the request is received. The Debarring Official may postpone the date of the meeting if the respondent requests a postponement in writing. At the meeting, the respondent, appearing personally or through an attorney or other authorized representative, may present and explain evidence that causes for debarment do not exist, evidence of any mitigating factors, and arguments concerning the imposition, scope, or duration of a proposed debarment or debarment.
              (4) Fact-finding conference. The purpose of a fact-finding conference under this section is to provide the respondent an opportunity to dispute material facts through the submission of oral and written evidence; resolve facts in dispute; and provide the Debarring Official with findings of fact based, as applicable, on adequate evidence or on a preponderance of the evidence. The fact-finding conference shall be conducted in accordance with rules consistent with 48 CFR 9.406-3(b). The Fact-Finding Official will notify the affected parties of the schedule for the hearing. The Fact-Finding Official shall deliver written findings of fact to the Debarring Official (together with a transcription of the proceeding, if made) within a certain time period after the hearing record closes as specified by the Fact-Finding Official. The findings shall resolve any disputes over material facts based upon a preponderance of the evidence, if the case involves a proposal to debar, or on adequate evidence, if the case involves a suspension. Since convictions or civil judgments generally establish the cause for debarment by a preponderance of the evidence, there usually is no genuine dispute over a material fact that would warrant a fact-finding conference for those proposed debarments based on convictions or civil judgments.
              (d) Debarring Official's decision. (4) The Debarring Official's final decision shall be based on the administrative record. In those actions where additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared and included in the final decision. In those cases where the contractor has requested and received a fact-finding conference, the written findings of fact shall be those findings prepared by the Fact-Finding Official. Findings of fact shall be final and conclusive unless, within 15 days of receipt of the findings, the Department or the respondent requests reconsideration, or unless set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Fact-Finding Official shall be provided a copy of the Debarring Official's final decision.

              909.406-70
              Requests for reconsideration of debarment.
              (a) At any time during a period of debarment, a respondent may submit to the Debarring or Suspending Official a written request for reconsideration of the scope, duration, or effects of the suspension/debarment action because of new information or changed circumstances, as discussed at 48 CFR 9.406-4(c).
              (b) In reviewing a request for reconsideration, the Debarring or Suspending Official may, in his or her discretion, utilize any of the procedures (meeting and fact-finding) set forth in 909.406-3 and 909.407-3. The Debarring or Suspending Official's final disposition of the reconsideration request shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons why the request has been granted or denied. A notice transmitting a copy of the disposition of the request for reconsideration shall be sent to the respondent.

              Causes for suspension.
              (d) The Suspending Official may suspend an organization or individual—
              (1) Indicted for or suspected, upon adequate evidence, of the causes described in 909.406-2(c)(1);
              (2) On the basis of the causes set forth in 909.406-2(d)(2); or
              (3) On the basis that an organization or individual is an affiliate of a suspended or debarred contractor.

              909.407-3
              Procedures.
              (b) Decisionmaking process. (1) In actions based on an indictment, the Suspending Official shall make a decision based upon the administrative record, which shall include submissions made by the contractor in accordance with 909.406-3(b)(1) and 909.406-3(b)(3).
              (2) For actions not based on an indictment, the procedures in 909.406-3(b)(2) and 48 CFR 9.407-3(b)(2) apply.
              (3) Coordination with Department of Justice. Whenever a meeting or fact-finding conference is requested, the Suspending Official's legal representative shall obtain the advice of appropriate Department of Justice officials concerning the impact disclosure of evidence at the meeting or fact-finding conference could have on any pending civil or criminal investigation or legal proceeding. If such Department of Justice official requests in writing that evidence needed to establish the existence of a cause for suspension not be disclosed to the respondent, the Suspending Official shall—
              (i) Decline to rely on such evidence and withdraw (without prejudice) the suspension or proposed debarment until such time as disclosure of the evidence is authorized; or

              (ii) Deny the request for a meeting or fact-finding and base the suspension decision solely upon the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the respondent.
              (e) Notice of suspending official's decision. In actions in which additional proceedings have been held, following such proceedings, the Suspending Official shall notify respondent, as applicable, in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.
              (1) Upon deciding to sustain a suspension, the Suspending Official shall promptly send each affected respondent a notice containing the following information:
              (i) A reference to the notice of suspension, the meeting and the fact-finding conference;
              (ii) The Suspending Official's findings of fact and conclusions of law;
              (iii) The reasons for sustaining a suspension;
              (iv) A reference to the Suspending Official's waiver authority under 909.405;
              (v) A statement that the suspension is effective throughout the Executive Branch as provided in 48 CFR 9.407-1(d);
              (vi) Modifications, if any, of the initial terms of the suspension;
              (vii) A statement that the respondent's name and address will be added to the EPLS; and
              (viii) If less than an entire organization is suspended, specification of the organizational element(s) or individual(s) included within the scope of the suspension.
              (2) If the Suspending Official decides to terminate a suspension, the Suspending Official shall promptly send, by certified mail, return receipt requested, each affected respondent a copy of the final decision required under this section.

              Contracting officer's responsibility.
              (d) The contracting officer shall evaluate the statement by the apparent successful offeror or, where individual contracts are negotiated with all firms in the competitive range, all such firms for interests relating to a potential organizational conflict of interest in the performance of the proposed contract. Using that information and any other credible information, the contracting officer shall make written determination of whether those interests create an actual or significant potential organizational conflict of interest and identify any actions that may be taken to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. In fulfilling their responsibilities for identifying and resolving potential conflicts, contracting officers should avoid creating unnecessary delays, burdensome information requirements, and excessive documentation.
              (e) The contracting officer shall award the contract to the apparent successful offeror unless a conflict of interest is determined to exist that cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated. Before determining to withold award based on organizational conflict of interest considerations, the contracting officer shall notify the offeror, provide the reasons therefor, and allow the offeror a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the conflict of interest cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction, the contracting officer may disqualify the offeror from award and undertake the disclosure, evaluation, and determination process with the firm next in line for award. If the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of the United States to award the contract notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver shall be submitted in accordance with 909.503. The waiver request and decisions shall be included in the contract file.

              (2) Contracting officers may make appropriate modifications where necessary to address the potential for organizational conflicts of interest in individual contracts. Contracting officers shall determine the appropriate term of the bar of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the clause at 952.209-72 and enter that term in the blank provided. In the usual case of a contract for advisory and assistance services a period of three, four, or five years is appropriate; however, in individual cases the contracting officer may insert a term of greater or lesser duration.

              (b) Contracts, which are not subject to part 970 but provide for the operation of a DOE site or facility or environmental remediation of a specific DOE site or sites, shall contain the organizational conflict of interest clause at 952.209-72. The organizational conflicts of interest clause in such contracts shall include Alternate I to that clause.

              915.207-70
              Handling proposals and information during evaluation.
              (a) Proposals furnished to the Government are to be used for evaluation purposes only. Disclosure outside the Government for evaluation is permitted only to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with, the procedures in this subsection.
              (b) While the Government's limited use of proposals does not require that the proposal bear a restrictive notice, proposers should, if they desire to maximize protection of their trade secrets or confidential or privileged commercial and financial information contained in them, apply the restrictive notice prescribed in paragraph (e) of the provision at 48 CFR 52.215-1 to such information. In any event, information contained in proposals will be protected to the extent permitted by law, but the Government assumes no liability for the use or disclosure of information (data) not made subject to such notice in accordance with paragraph (e) of the provision at 48 CFR 52.215-1.
              (c) If proposals are received with more restrictive conditions than those in paragraph (e) of the provision at 48 CFR 52.215-1, the contracting officer or coordinating officer shall inquire whether the submitter is willing to accept the conditions of paragraph (e). If the submitter does not, the contracting officer or coordinating officer shall, after consultation with counsel, either return the proposal or accept it as marked. Contracting officers shall not exclude from consideration any proposals merely because they contain an authorized or agreed to notice, nor shall they be prejudiced by such notice.
              (d) Release of proposal information (data) before decision as to the award of a contract, or the transfer of valuable and sensitive information between competing offerors during the competitive phase of the acquisition process, would seriously disrupt the Government's decision-making process and undermine the integrity of the competitive acquisition process, thus adversely affecting the Government's ability to solicit competitive proposals and award a contract which would best meet the Government's needs and serve the public interest. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, none of the information (data) contained in proposals, except as authorized in this subsection, is to be disclosed outside the Government before the Government's decision as to the award of a contract. In the event an outside evaluation is to be obtained, it shall be only to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with the procedures of, this subsection.
              (e)(1) In order to maintain the integrity of the procurement process and to assure that the propriety of proposals will be respected, contracting officers shall assure that the following notice is affixed to each solicited proposal prior to distribution for evaluation:
              
                Government Notice for Handling Proposals
                This proposal shall be used and disclosed for evaluation purposes only, and a copy of this Government notice shall be applied to any reproduction or abstract thereof. Any authorized restrictive notices which the submitter places on this proposal shall also be strictly complied with. Disclosure of this proposal outside the Government for evaluation purposes shall be made only to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with, the procedures in DEAR subsection 915.207-70.
              
              (End of notice)
              (2) The notice at 48 CFR 15.609(d) for unsolicited proposals shall be affixed to a cover sheet attached to each such proposal upon receipt by DOE. Use of the notice neither alters any obligation of the Government, nor diminishes any rights in the Government to use or disclose data or information.

              (f)(1) Normally, evaluations of proposals shall be performed only by employees of the Department of Energy. As used in this section, “proposals” includes the offers in response to requests for proposals, sealed bids, program opportunity announcements, program research and development announcements, or any other method of solicitation where the review of proposals or bids is to be performed by other than peer review. In certain cases, in order to gain necessary expertise, employees of other agencies may be used in instances in which they will be available and committed during the period of evaluation. Evaluators or advisors who are not Federal employees, including employees of DOE management and operating contractors, may be used where necessary. Where such non-Federal employees are used as evaluators, they may only participate as members of technical evaluation committees. They may not serve as members of the Source Evaluation Board or equivalent board or committee.
              (2)(i) Pursuant to section 6002 of Pub. L. 103-355, a determination is required for every competitive procurement as to whether sufficient DOE personnel with the necessary training and capabilities are available to evaluate the proposals that will be received. This determination, discussed at 48 CFR 37.204, shall be made in the memorandum appointing the technical evaluation committee by the Source Selection Official, in the case of Source Evaluation Board procurements, or by the Contracting Officer in all other procurements.
              (ii) Where it is determined such qualified personnel are not available within DOE but are available from other Federal agencies, a determination to that effect shall be made by the same officials in the same memorandum. Should such qualified personnel not be available, a determination to use non-Federal evaluators or advisors must be made in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this subsection.
              (3) The decision to employ non-Federal evaluators or advisors, including employees of DOE management and operating contractors, in Source Evaluation Board procurements must be made by the Source Selection Official with the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity. In all other procurements, the decision shall be made by the senior program official or designee with the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity. In a case where multiple solicitations are part of a single program and would call for the same resources for evaluation, a class determination to use non-Federal evaluators may be made by the Senior Procurement Executive.
              (4) Where such non-Federal evaluators or advisors are to be used, the solicitation shall contain a provision informing prospective offerors that non-Federal personnel may be used in the evaluation of proposals.
              (5) The nondisclosure agreement as it appears in paragraph (f)(6) of this subsection shall be signed before DOE furnishes a copy of the proposal to non-Federal evaluators or advisors, and care should be taken that the required handling notice described in paragraph (e) of this subsection is affixed to a cover sheet attached to the proposal before it is disclosed to the evaluator or advisor. In all instances, such persons will be required to comply with nondisclosure of information requirements and requirements involving Procurement Integrity, see 48 CFR 3.104; with requirements to prevent the potential for personal conflicts of interest; or, where a non-Federal evaluator or advisor is acquired under a contract with an entity other than the individual, with requirements to prevent the potential for organizational conflicts of interest.
              (6) Non-Federal evaluators or advisors shall be required to sign the following agreement prior to having access to any proposal:
              
                Nondisclosure Agreement

                Whenever DOE furnishes a proposal for evaluation, I, the recipient, agree to use the information contained in the proposal only for DOE evaluation purposes and to treat the information obtained in confidence. This requirement for confidential treatment does not apply to information obtained from any source, including the proposer, without restriction. Any notice or restriction placed on the proposal by either DOE or the originator of the proposal shall be conspicuously affixed to any reproduction or abstract thereof and its provisions strictly complied with. Upon completion of the evaluation, it is agreed all copies of the proposal and abstracts, if any, shall be returned to the DOE office which initially furnished the proposal for evaluation. Unless authorized by the Contracting Officer, I agree that I shall not contact the originator of the proposal concerning any aspect of its elements.
                
                Recipient:
                
                Date:
              
              
              (End of agreement)
              (g) The submitter of any proposal shall be provided notice adequate to afford an opportunity to take appropriate action before release of any information (data) contained therein pursuant to a request under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552); and, time permitting, the submitter should be consulted to obtain assistance in determining the eligibility of the information (data) in question as an exemption under the Act.

              (d) Personnel from DOE, other Government agencies, consultants, and contractors, including those who manage or operate Government-owned facilities, may be used in the evaluation process as evaluators or advisors when their services are necessary and available. When personnel outside the Government, including those of contractors who operate or manage Government-owned facilities, are to be used as evaluators or advisors, approval and nondisclosure procedures as required by 915.207-70 shall be followed and a notice of the use of non-Federal evaluators shall be included in the solicitation. In all instances, such personnel will be required to comply with DOE conflict of interest and nondisclosure requirements.

              915.404-2
              Information to support proposal analysis.
              (a)(1) Field pricing assistance as discussed in 48 CFR 15.404-2(a) is not required for the negotiation of DOE contract prices or modifications thereof. The term “field pricing assistance” refers to the Department of Defense (DOD) system for obtaining a price and/or cost analysis report from a cognizant DOD field level contract management office wherein requests for the review of a proposal submitted by an offeror are initiated and the recommendations made by the various specialists of the management office are consolidated into a single report that is forwarded to the office making the contract award for use in conducting negotiations. In the DOE, such review activities, except for reviews performed by professional auditors, are expected to be accomplished by pricing support personnel located in DOE Contracting Activities. The DOE contracting officer shall formally request the assistance of appropriate pricing support personnel, other than auditors, for the review of any proposal that exceeds the threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1), unless the contracting officer has sufficient data to determine the reasonableness of the proposed cost or price. Such pricing support may be requested for proposals below the threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1), if considered necessary for the establishment of a reasonable pricing arrangement. Contracting officers, however, are not precluded by this section from requesting pricing assistance from a cognizant DOD contract management office, provided an appropriate cross-servicing arrangement for pricing support services exists between the DOE and the servicing agency.
              (c)(1) When an audit is required pursuant to 915.404-2-70, “Audit as an aid in proposal analysis,” the request for audit shall be sent directly to the Federal audit office assigned cognizance of the offeror or prospective contractor. When the cognizant agency is other than the Defense Contract Audit Agency or the Department of Health and Human Services, and an appropriate interagency agreement has not been established, the need for audit assistance shall be coordinated with the Office of Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.
              (2)(i) The request for audit shall establish the due date for receipt of the auditor's report and in so doing shall allow as much time as possible for the auditor's review.

              (ii) Copies of technical analysis reports prepared by DOE technical or other pricing support personnel shall not normally be provided to the auditor. The contracting officer or the supporting price, cost, or financial analyst at the contracting activity shall determine the monetary impact of the technical findings.

              915.404-2-70
              Audit as an aid in proposal analysis.
              (a) When a contract price will be based on cost or pricing data submitted by the offerors, the DOE contracting officer or authorized representative shall request a review by the cognizant Federal audit activity prior to the negotiation of any contract or modification including modifications under advertised contracts in excess of—
              (1) The threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1) for a firm fixed-price contract or a fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment provisions; or adjustment provisions; or
              (2) Twice the threshold at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1) for requiring cost or pricing data for all other contract types, including initial prices, estimated costs of cost-reimbursement contracts, interim and final price redeterminations, and target and settlement of incentive contracts.
              (b) The requirement for auditor reviews of proposals which exceed the thresholds specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be waived at a level above the contracting officer when the reasonableness of the negotiated contract price can be determined from information already available. The contract file shall be documented to reflect the reason for any such waiver, provided, however, that independent Government estimates of cost or price shall not be used as the sole justification for any such waiver.

              Profit.
              (c)(4)(i) Contracting officer responsibilities. The statutory limitations on price and fee as set forth in 48 CFR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i) shall be followed, except as exempted for DOE architect-engineer contracts covering Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) functions. Pursuant to section 602(d) (13) and (20) of the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949, as amended, those former AEC functions, as well as those of the BPA, now being performed by DOE are exempt from the 6 percent of cost restriction on contracts for architect-engineer services. The estimated costs on which the maximum fee is computed shall include facilities capital cost of money when this cost is included in cost estimates.
              (c)(6) In cases where a change or modification calls for substantially different work than the basic contract, the contractor's effort may be radically changed and a detailed analysis of the profit factors would be a necessity. Also, if the dollar amount of the change or contract modification is very significant in comparison to the contract dollar amount, a detailed analysis should be made.
              (d) Profit-analysis factors. A profit/fee analysis technique designed for a systematic application of the profit factors in 48 CFR 15.404-4(d) provides contracting officers with an approach that will ensure consistent consideration of the relative value of the various factors in the establishment of a profit objective and the conduct of negotiations for a contract award. It also provides a basis for documentation of this objective, including an explanation of any significant departure from it in reaching a final agreement. The contracting officer's analysis of these prescribed factors is based on information available prior to negotiations. Such information is furnished in proposals, audit data, performance reports, preaward surveys and the like.

              General.
              (a) Objective. It is the intent of DOE to remunerate contractors for financial and other risks which they may assume, resources they use, and organization, performance and management capabilities they employ. Profit or fee shall be negotiated for this purpose; however, when profit or fee is determined as a separate element of the contract price, the aim of negotiation should be to fit it to the acquisition, giving due weight to effort, risk, facilities investment, and special factors as set forth in this subpart.
              (b) Commercial (profit) organization. Profit or fee prenegotiation objectives for contracts with commercial (profit) organizations shall be determined as provided in this subpart.
              (c) Nonprofit organizations. It is DOE's general policy to pay fees in contracts with nonprofit organizations other than educational institutions and governmental bodies; however, it is a matter of negotiation whether a fee will be paid in a given case. In making this decision, the DOE negotiating official should consider whether the contractor is ordinarily paid fees for the type of work involved. The profit objective should be reasonable in relation to the task to be performed and the requirements placed on the contractor.
              (d) Educational institutions. It is DOE policy not to pay fees under contracts with educational institutions.
              (e) State, local and Indian tribal governments. Profit or fee shall not be paid under contracts with State, local, and Indian tribal Governments.
            
            
              915.404-4-70-2
              Weighted guidelines system.
              (a) To properly reflect differences among contracts and the circumstances relating thereto and to select an appropriate relative profit/fee in consideration of these differences and circumstances, weightings have been developed for application by the contracting officer to standard measurement bases representative of the prescribed profit factors cited in 48 CFR 15.404-4(d) and paragraph (d) of this section. This is a structured system, referred to as weighted guidelines. Each profit factor or subfactor, or component thereof, has been assigned weights relative to their value to the contract's overall effort. The range of weights to be applied to each profit factor is also set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Guidance on how to apply the weighted guidelines is set forth in 915.404-4-70-8.
              (b) Except as set forth in 915.404-4-70-4, the weighted guidelines shall be used in establishing the profit objective for negotiation of contracts where cost analysis is performed.
              (c) The negotiation process does not contemplate or require agreement on either estimated cost elements or profit elements. Accordingly, although the details of analysis and evaluation may be discussed in the fact-finding phase of the negotiation process in order to develop a mutual understanding of the logic of the respective positions, specific agreement on the exact weights of values of the individual profit factors is not required and need not be attempted.
              (d) The factors set forth in the following table are to be used in determining DOE profit objectives. The factors and weight ranges for each factor shall be used in all instances where the weighted guidelines are applied.

              Documentation.
              Determination of the profit or fee objective, in accordance with this subpart shall be fully documented. Since the profit objective is the contracting officer's pre-negotiation evaluation of a total profit allowance for the proposed contract, the amounts developed for each category of cost will probably change in the course of negotiation. Furthermore, the negotiated amounts will probably vary from the objective and from the pre-negotiation detailed application of the weighted guidelines technique to each element of the contractor's input to total performance. Since the profit objective is viewed as a whole rather than as its component parts, insignificant variations from the pre-negotiation profit objective, as a result of changes to the contractor's input to total performance, need not be documented in detail. Conversely, significant deviations from the profit objective necessary to reach a final agreement on profit or fee shall be explained in the price negotiation memorandum prepared in accordance with 48 CFR 15.406-3.

              915.404-4-70-4
              Exceptions.
              (a) For contracts not expected to exceed the threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1), the weighted guidelines need not be used; however, the contracting officer may use the weighted guidelines for contracts below this amount if he or she elects to do so.
              (b) For the following classes of contracts, the weighted guidelines shall not be used—
              (1) Commercialization and demonstration type contracts;
              (2) Management and operating contracts;
              (3) Construction contracts;
              (4) Construction management contracts;
              (5) Contracts primarily requiring delivery of material supplied by subcontractors;
              (6) Termination settlements; and
              (7) Contracts with educational institutions.
              (c) In addition to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the contracting officer need not use the weighted guidelines in unusual pricing situations where the weighted guidelines method has been determined by the DOE negotiating official to be unsuitable. Such exceptions shall be justified in writing and shall be authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity. The contract file shall include this documentation and any other information that may support the exception.
              (d) If the contracting officer makes a written determination that the pricing situation meets any of the circumstances set forth in this section, other methods for establishing the profit objective may be used. For contracts other than those subject to subpart 917.6, the selected method shall be supported in a manner similar to that used in the weighted guidelines (profit factor breakdown and documentation of profit objectives); however, investment or other factors that would not be applicable to the contract shall be excluded from the profit objective determination. It is intended that the methods will result in profit objectives for noncapital intensive contracts that are below those generally developed for capital intensive contracts.

              Special considerations—contracts with nonprofit organizations (other than educational institutions).

              (a) For purposes of identification, nonprofit organizations are defined as those business entities organized and operated exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, of which no part of the net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, of which no substantial part of the activities is attempting to influence legislation or participating in any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office, and which are exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
              (b) In computing the amount of profit or fee to be paid, the DOE negotiating official shall take into account the tax benefits received by a nonprofit organization. While it is difficult to establish the degree to which a remuneration under any given contract contributes to an organization's overall net profit, the DOE negotiating official should assume that there is an element of profit in any amount to be paid.
              (c) In order to assure consideration of the tax posture of nonprofit organizations during a profit or fee negotiation, the DOE negotiating official shall calculate the fee as for a contract with a commercial concern and then reduce it at least 25 percent. However, depending on the circumstances, the contracting officer may pay profit or fees somewhere between this amount and the appropriate profit or fee as if it were a commercial concern. When this is the case, the contract file shall be documented to specifically state the reason or reasons.
              (d) Where a contract with a nonprofit organization is for the operation of Government-owned facilities, the fee should be calculated using the procedures and schedules applicable to operating contracts as set forth in part 970.

              Contracts with educational institutions.
              In certain situations the DOE may contract with a university to manage or operate Government-owned laboratories. These efforts are generally apart from, and not in conjunction with, their other activities, and the complexity and magnitude of the work are not normally found in standard university research or study contracts. Such operating contracts are subject to the applicable provisions set forth in part 970.

              Alternative techniques.
              (a) Profit or fees to be paid on construction contracts and construction management contracts shall be determined in accordance with the applicable profit/fee technique for such contracts set forth in 915.404-4-71.
              (b) Profit and fee to be paid on contracts under the threshold stated at 48 CFR 15.403-4(a)(1), not using the weighted guidelines, shall be judgmentally developed by the contracting officer by assigning individual dollar amounts to the factors appropriate to DOE profit considerations discussed in 915.404-4-70-2(d).
              (c) Contracts which require only delivery or furnishing of goods or services supplied by subcontractors shall include a fee or profit which, in the best judgment of the contracting officer, is appropriate. It would be expected that there would be a declining relationship of profit/fee dollars in relation to total costs. The higher the cost of subcontracts, for example, the lower the profit/fee ratio to these costs.
              (d) Profit/Fee considerations in termination settlements are often a question of equity. They are a matter of negotiation. They should not, however, exceed what would have otherwise been payable under weighted guidelines had the termination not occurred.

              General.

              (a) Business concerns awarded a DOE construction or construction management contract shall be paid a profit or fee if requested or solicited. The profit or fee objective for a construction or construction management contract shall be an amount appropriate for the type of effort contained therein. It is the intent of DOE to—
              (1) Reward contractors based on the complexity of work;
              (2) Reward contractors who demonstrate and establish excellent records of performance; and
              (3) Reward contractors who contribute their own resources, including facilities and investment of capital.
              (b) Standard fees or across-the-board agreements will not be used or made. Profit or fee objectives are to be determined for each contract according to the effort or task contracted thereunder.
              (c) Profit or fee payable on fixed-price and cost-reimbursable construction or construction management contracts shall be established in accordance with the appropriate procedures and schedules set forth in this subpart.

              915.404-4-71-3
              Factors for determining fees.
              (a) The profit policy stated in 915.404-4-71-1(a) reflects, in a broad sense, recognition that profit is compensation to contractors for the entrepreneurial function of organizing and managing resources (including capital resources), and the assumption of risk that all costs of performance (operating and capital) may not be reimbursable.
              (b) The best approach calls for a structure that allows judgmental evaluation and determination of fee dollars for prescribed factors which impact the need for, and the rewards associated with, fee or profit, as follows—
              (1) Management risk relating to performance, including the—
              (i) Quality and diversity of principal work tasks required to do the job;
              (ii) Labor intensity of the job;
              (iii) Special control problems; and
              (iv) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements;
              (2) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type and terms of the contract;
              (3) The relative difficulty of work, including consideration of technical and administrative knowledge, skill, experience and clarity of technical specifications;
              (4) Degree and amount of contract work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources, including the extent to which the contractor contributes plant, equipment, computers, or working capital (labor, etc.);
              (5) Duration of project;
              (6) Size of operation;
              (7) Benefits which may accrue to the contractor from gaining experience and know-how, from establishing or enhancing a reputation, or from being enabled to hold or expand a staff whose loyalties are primarily to the contractor; and
              (8) Other special considerations, including support of Government programs such as those relating to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business in subcontracting, energy conservation, etc.
              (c) The total fee objective and amount for a particular negotiation is established by judgmental considerations of the factors in paragraph (b) of this section, assigning fee values as deemed appropriate for each factor and totaling the resulting amounts.

              (d) In recognition of the complexities of this process, and to assist in promoting a reasonable degree of consistency and uniformity in its application, fee schedules have been developed which set forth maximum fee amounts that contracting activities are allowed to negotiate for a particular transaction without obtaining prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive. In addition, the fee negotiation objective established in accordance with 915.404-4-71-3(a), (b), and (c) shall not exceed the applicable fee schedule amounts without prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive. To facilitate application to a contract, the fee amounts are related to the total cost base which is defined as total operating and capital costs.

              915.404-4-71-4
              Considerations affecting fee amounts.
              (a) In selecting final fee amounts for the various factors in 915.404-4-71-3 of this section, the DOE negotiating official will have to make several judgments as discussed in this subsection.
              (b) Complexity of a construction project shall be considered by analysis of its major parts. For a project which includes items of work of different degrees of complexity, a single average classification should be considered, or the work should be divided into separate classifications. The following class identifications are appropriate for proper fee determinations.
              (1) Class A—Manufacturing plants involving operations requiring a high degree of design layout or process control; nuclear reactors; atomic particle accelerators; complex laboratories or industrial units especially designed for handling radioactive materials.
              (2) Class B—Normal manufacturing processes and assembly operations such as ore dressing, metal working plant and simple processing plants; power plants and accessory switching and transformer stations; water treatment plants; sewage disposal plants; hospitals; and ordinary laboratories.
              (3) Class C—Permanent administrative and general service buildings, permanent housing, roads, railroads, grading, sewers, storm drains, and water and power distribution systems.
              (4) Class D—Construction camps and facilities and other construction of a temporary nature.
              (c) Normal management elements of principal tasks relating to a construction contract cover several categories of tasks with differing rates of application throughout the construction period. The principal elements of management effort are outlined in this paragraph. Although each project has a total management value equal to 100% for all elements, the distribution of effort among the various elements will be different for each project due to differences in project character or size. The basic management elements and the normal range of efforts expected to apply for a normal sized project are as follows. When the normally expected effort will not be performed by a contractor, this fact should be considered in arriving at appropriate fee amounts.

              (d) Fee considerations dealing with the duration of a project are usually provided by the consideration given to the degree of complexity and magnitude of the work. In only very unusual circumstances should it be necessary to separately weight, positively or negatively, for the period of services or length of time involved in the project when determining fee levels.
              (e) The size of the operation is to a considerable degree a continuation of the complexity factor, and the degree and amount of work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources. Generally, no separate weighting, positively or negatively, is required for consideration of those factors.
              (f) The degree and amount of work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources affect the level of fees. Reasonable fees should be based on expectations of complete construction services normally associated with a construction or construction management contract. In the case of a construction contract, reduced services can be in the form of excessive subcontracting or supporting acquisition actions and labor relations interfaces being made by the government. If an unusual amount of such work is performed by other than the contractor, it will be necessary to make downward adjustments in the fee levels to provide for the reduction in services required.
              (g) The type of contract to be negotiated and the anticipated contractor cost risk shall be considered in establishing the appropriate fee objective for the contract.
              (h) When a contract calls for the contractor to use its own resources, including facilities and equipment, and to make its own cost investment (i.e., when there is no letter-of-credit financing), a positive impact on the fee amount shall be reflected.

              915.404-4-71-5
              Fee schedules.
              (a) The schedules included in this paragraph, adjusted in accordance with provisions of this section and 915.404-4-71-6, provide maximum fee levels for construction and construction management contracts. The fees are related to the estimated cost (fee base) for the construction work and services to be performed. The schedule in paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the basic fee schedule for construction contracts. The schedule in paragraph (f) of this section sets forth the basic fee schedule for construction management contracts. A separate schedule in paragraph (h) of this section has been developed for determining the fee applicable to special equipment purchases and to reflect a differing level of fee consideration associated with the subcontractor effort under construction management contracts. (See 915.404-4-71-6(c) and 915.404-4-71-6(d)).
              (b) The schedules cited in paragraph (a) of this section provide the maximum fee amount for a CPFF contract arrangement. If a fixed-price type contract is to be awarded, the fee amount set forth in the fee schedules shall be increased by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of the fee base.
              (c) The fee schedule shown in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section assumes a letter of credit financing arrangement. If a contract provides for or requires the contractor to make their own cost investment for contract performance (i.e., when there is no letter-of-credit financing), the fee amounts set forth in the fee schedules shall be increased by an amount equal to 5 percent of the fee amount as determined from the schedules.
              (d) The following schedule sets forth the base for construction contracts:

              (e) When using the Construction Contracts Schedule for establishing maximum payable basic fees, the following adjustments shall be made to the Schedule fee amounts for complexity levels, excessive subcontracting, normal contractor services performed by the government or another contractor:
              (1) The target fee amounts, set forth in the fee schedule, shall not be adjusted for a Class A project, which is maximum complexity. A Class B project requires a 10 percent reduction in amounts. Class C and D projects require a 20 percent and 30 percent reduction, respectively. The various classes are defined in 915.404-4-71-4(b).
              (2) The target fee schedule provides for 45 percent of the contract work to be subcontracted for such things as electrical and other specialties. Excessive subcontracting results when such efforts exceed 45 percent of the total contract work. To establish appropriate fee reductions for excessive subcontracting, the negotiating official should first determine the amount of subcontracting as a percentage of the total contract work. Next, the negotiating official should determine a percentage by which the prime contractor's normal requirement (based on a requirement for doing work with its own forces) is reduced due to the excessive subcontracting and, finally, multiply the two percentages to determine a fee reduction factor.
              (3) If acquisition or other services normally expected of the contractor (see 915.404-4-71-4(c)) are performed by the government, or another DOE prime or operating contractor, a fee reduction may also be required. The negotiating official should first determine what percentage of the total procurement or other required services is performed by others. Then the negotiating official should apply this percentage reduction to the normally assigned weightings for the management services or effort as discussed in 915.404-4-71-4(c) to arrive at the appropriate reduction factor.
              (f) The following schedule sets forth the base for construction management contracts:

              (g) When applying the basic Construction Management Contracts Schedule for determining maximum payable fees, no adjustments are necessary to such payable fees for contractor Force account labor used for work which should otherwise be subcontracted until such Force account work exceeds, in the aggregate, 20 percent of the base. Excessive use of Force account work results when such effort exceeds 20 percent of the fee base; and, when this occurs, appropriate fee reductions for such excessive Force account labor shall be computed as follows:
              (1) Determine the percentage amount of Force account work to total contractor effort.
              (2) Determine the percentage amount of subcontract work reduced due to the use of Force account work.

              (3) Multiply the two percentages to determine the fee reduction factor. It is not expected that reductions in the Construction Management Contracts Schedule fee amounts will be made for complexity, reduced requirements and similar adjustments as made for construction contracts.
              (h) The schedule of fees for consideration of special equipment purchases and for consideration of the subcontract program under a construction management contract is as follows:

              915.404-4-71-6
              Fee base.
              (a) The fee base shown in the Construction Contracts Schedule and Construction Management Contracts Schedule represents that estimate of cost to which a percentage factor is applied to determine maximum fee allowances. The fee base is the estimated necessary allowable cost of the construction work or other services which are to be performed. It shall include the estimated cost for, but is not limited to, the following as they may apply in the case of a construction or construction management contract:
              (1) Site preparation and utilities.
              (2) Construction (labor-materials-supplies) of buildings and auxiliary facilities.
              (3) Construction (labor-materials-supplies) to complete/construct temporary buildings.
              (4) Design services to support the foregoing.
              (5) General management and job planning cost.
              (6) Labor supervision.
              (7) Procurement and acquisition administration.
              (8) Construction performed by subcontractors.
              (9) Installation of government furnished or contractor acquired special equipment and other equipment.
              (10) Equipment (other than special equipment) which is to become Government property (including a component of Government property).
              (b) The fee base for the basic fee determination for a construction contract and construction management contract shall include all necessary and allowable costs cited in paragraph (a) of this section as appropriate to the type of contract; except, any home office G&A expense paid as a contract cost per cost principle guidance and procedures shall be excluded from the fee base. The fee base shall exclude:
              (1) Cost of land.
              (2) Cost of engineering (A&E work).
              (3) Contingency estimate.
              (4) Equipment rentals or use charges.
              (5) Cost of government furnished equipment or materials.
              (6) Special equipment.
              (c) A separate fee base shall be established for special equipment for use in applying the Special Equipment Purchases or Subcontract Work Schedule (see 915.404-4-71-5(h)). The fee base for determination of applicable fees on special equipment shall be based on the estimated purchase price of the equipment.

              (d) The fee base under the Construction Management Contracts Schedule for a maximum basic fee determination for a construction management contract shall be comprised of only the costs of the construction manager's own efforts. However, it is recognized that in the case of construction management contracts, the actual construction work will be performed by subcontractors. In most cases the subcontract awards for the construction work will be made by the construction management contractor. Occasionally the contract may involve management of construction performed under a contract awarded by the Department or by one of the Department's operating contractors. In these cases, the actual cost of the subcontracted construction work shall be excluded from the fee base used to determine the maximum basic fee (under the Construction Management Contracts Schedule) applicable to a construction management contract. A separate fee base for additional allowances (using the Special Equipment Purchases or Subcontract Work Schedule) shall be established, which shall be comprised of those subcontract construction costs, special equipment purchases, and other items' costs that are contracted for or purchased by the construction manager.

              Special considerations for cost-plus-award-fee contracts.
              (a) When a contract is to be awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis several special considerations are appropriate. Fee objectives for management and operating contracts or other contracts as determined by the Senior Procurement Executive, including those using the Construction, Construction Management, or Special Equipment Purchases/Subcontract Work schedules from 915.404-4-71-5, shall be developed pursuant to the procedures set forth in 970.15404-4-8. Fee objectives for other cost-plus-award-fee contracts shall be in accordance with 916.405-2 and be developed as follows:
              (1) The base fee portion of the fee objective of an award fee contract may range from 0% up to the 50% level of the fee amount for a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract, arrived at by using the weighted guidelines or other techniques (such as those provided in 915.404-4-71 for construction and construction management contracts). However, the base amount should not normally exceed 50% of the otherwise applicable fixed fee. In the event this 50% limit is exceeded, appropriate documentation shall be entered into the contract file. In no event shall the base fee exceed 60% of the fixed fee amount.
              (2) The base fee plus the amount included in the award fee pool should normally not exceed the fixed fee (as subjectively determined or as developed from the fee schedule) by more than 50%. However, in the event the base fee is to be less than 50% of the fixed fee, the maximum potential award fee may be increased proportionately with the decreases in base fee amounts.
              (3) The following maximum potential award fees shall apply in award fee contracts: (percent is stated as percent of fee schedule amounts).
              
                
                  Base fee percent

              Policy.

              (a) Present and future needs demand the involvement of all resources in exploring alternative energy sources and technologies. To achieve this objective, it is DOE policy to encourage external sources of unique and innovative methods, approaches, and ideas by stressing submission of unsolicited proposals for government support. In furtherance of this policy and to ensure the integrity of the acquisition process through application of reasonable controls, the DOE:
              (1) Disseminates information on areas of broad technical concern whose solutions are considered relevant to the accomplishment of DOE's assigned mission areas;
              (2) Encourages potential proposers to consult with program personnel before expending resources in the development of written unsolicited proposals;
              (3) Endeavors to distribute unsolicited proposals to all interested organizations within DOE;
              (4) Processes unsolicited proposals in an expeditious manner and, where practicable, keeps proposers advised as discrete decisions are made;
              (5) Assures that each proposal is evaluated in a fair and objective manner; and, (6) Assures that each proposal will be used only for its intended purpose and the information, subject to applicable laws and regulations, contained therein will not be divulged without prior permission of the proposer.

              General.
              (f) Unsolicited proposals for the performance of support services are, except as discussed in this paragraph, unacceptable as the performance of such services is unlikely to necessitate innovative and unique concepts. There may be rare instances in which an unsolicited proposal offers an innovative and unique approach to the accomplishment of a support service. If such a proposal offers a previously unknown or an alternative approach to generally recognized techniques for the accomplishment of a specific service(s) and such approach will provide significantly greater economy or enhanced quality, it may be considered for acceptance. Such acceptance shall, however, require approval of the acquisition of support services in accordance with applicable DOE Directives and be processed as a deviation to the prohibition in this paragraph.

Box 10940, MS 921-107, Pittsburgh, PA 15236-0940. If the proposer has ascertained the cognizant program office through preliminary contacts with program staff, the proposal may be submitted directly to that office. In such instances, the proposer should separately send a copy of the proposal cover letter to the unsolicited proposal coordinator to assure that the proposal is logged in the Department's automated tracking system for unsolicited proposals.

              (d) Fee determination plans. Award fee arrangements limited to technical performance considerations are prohibited because they may increase cost disproportionately to any benefits gained. Instead, the award fee arrangement shall include both technical performance (including scheduling as appropriate) and business management considerations tailored to the needs of the particular situation. In addition, in a situation where cost estimating reliability and other factors are such that the negotiation of a separate predetermined incentive sharing arrangement applicable to cost performance is determined both feasible and advantageous, cost incentives may be added. The resulting contract would then be identified as a cost-plus-incentive-fee/award-fee combination type. The goals and evaluation criteria should be results-oriented. The award fee should be concentrated on the end product of the contract, that is, output, be it hardware, research and development, demonstration or services, together with business management considerations. However, input criteria such as equal employment opportunity, small business programs, functional management areas, such as safety, security, etc., should not be disregarded and may be appropriate criteria upon which to base some part of the award fee. Specific goals or objectives shall be established in relation to each performance evaluation criterion against which contractor performance is measured.

              Scope of subpart.
              (a) This subpart sets forth the DOE policy on cost participation by organizations performing research, development, and/or demonstration projects under DOE prime contracts. This subpart does not cover efforts and projects performed for DOE by other Federal agencies.
              (b) Cost participation is a generic term denoting any situation where the Government does not fully reimburse the performer for all allowable costs necessary to accomplish the project or effort under the contract. The term encompasses cost sharing, cost matching, cost limitation (direct or indirect), participation in kind, and similar concepts.
            
            
              
              917.7001
              Policy.
              (a) When DOE supports performer research, development, and/or demonstration efforts, where the principal purpose is ultimate commercialization and utilization of the technologies by the private sector, and when there are reasonable expectations that the performer will receive present or future economic benefits beyond the instant contract as a result of performance of the effort, it is DOE policy to obtain cost participation. Full funding may be provided for early phases of development programs when the technological problems are still great.
              (b) In making the determination to obtain cost participation, and evaluating present and future economic benefits to the performer, DOE will consider the technical feasibility, projected economic viability, societal and political acceptability of commercial application, as well as possible effects of other DOE-supported projects in competing technologies.
              (c) The propriety, manner, and amount of cost participation must be decided on a case-by-case basis.
              (d) Cost participation is required for demonstration projects unless exempted by the Under Secretary. Demonstration projects, pursuant to this subpart, include demonstrations of technological advances and field demonstrations of new methods and procedures, and demonstrations of prototype commercial applications for the exploration, development, production, transportation, conversion, and utilization of energy resources.

              (a) This subpart discusses the policy for the use of a program opportunity notice solicitation approach to accelerate the demonstration of the technical feasibility and commercial application of all potentially beneficial nonnuclear energy sources and utilization technologies.
              (b) This subpart applies to demonstrations performed by individuals, educational institutions, commercial or industrial organizations, or other private entities, public entities, including State and local governments, but not other Federal agencies. For purposes of this subpart, commercial demonstration projects include demonstrations of technological advances, field demonstrations of new methods and procedures, and demonstration of prototype commercial applications for the exploration, development, production, transportation, conversion, and utilization of non-nuclear energy resources.

              (a) It is DOE's intent to encourage the submission of proposals to accelerate the demonstration of the technical, operational, economic, and commercial feasibility and environmental acceptability of particular energy technologies, systems, subsystems, and components. Program opportunity notices will be used to provide information concerning scientific and technological areas encompassed by DOE's programs. DOE shall, from time to time, issue program opportunity notices for proposals for demonstrations of various forms of non-nuclear energy and technology utilization.
              (b) Each program opportunity notice shall as a minimum describe: the goal of the intended demonstration effort; the time schedule for award; evaluation criteria; program policy factors; the amount of cost detail required; and proposal submission information. Program policy factors are those factors which, while not appropriate indicators of a proposal's individual merit (i.e., technical excellence, proposer's ability, cost, etc.), are relevant and essential to the process of choosing which of the proposals received will, taken together, best achieve the program objectives. All such factors shall be predetermined and specified in the notice so as to notify proposers that factors which are essentially beyond their control will affect the selection process.

              (a) This subpart discusses the policy for the use of a program research and development announcement (PRDA) solicitation approach to obtain and select proposals from the private sector for the conduct of research, development, and related activities in the energy field.

              917.7301-1
              General.
              (a) PRDAs shall be used to provide potential proposers with information concerning DOE's interest in entering into arrangements for research, development, and related projects in specified areas of interest. It is DOE's intent to solicit the submission of ideas which will serve as a basis for research, development, and related activities in the energy field. It is DOE's desire to encourage the involvement of small business concerns, small disadvantage business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns in research and development undertaken pursuant to PRDAs.
              (b) The PRDA should not replace existing acquisition procedures where a requirement can be sufficiently defined for solicitation under standard advertised or negotiated acquisition procedures. Similarly, it should not inhibit or curtail the submission of unsolicited proposals. However, a proposal which is submitted as though it were unsolicited but is in fact germane to an existing PRDA shall be treated as though submitted in response to the announcement or returned without action to the proposer, at the proposer's option. Further, the PRDA is not to be used in a competitive situation where it is appropriate to negotiate a study contract to obtain analysis and recommendations to be incorporated in the subsequent request for proposals.

              The acquisition of real estate requires the involvement of a DOE Certified Realty Specialist, as specified at 917.7402. Special circumstances and situations may arise under cost-type contracts when, in the performance of the contract or subcontract, the performer shall be required, or otherwise find it necessary, to acquire real estate or interests therein by:
              (a) Purchase, on DOE's behalf or in its own name, with title eventually vesting in the Government.
              (b) Lease for which DOE will reimburse the contractor for the pre-approved costs incurred under the lease.

              (d)(1) Where the cost to the Government may be affected, approval of hours of work in excess of the normal workweek is justified only in those instances and for those employees where it can be shown that overtime would provide needed and demonstrable impetus to the accomplishment of Department of Energy (DOE) objectives and that all other means of meeting these objectives have been considered and found inadequate or not feasible. Accordingly, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall—
              (i) Establish controls to prevent excess casual overtime and to assure that such overtime work is in the best interest of the Government. Casual overtime means—
              (A) Work in excess of the normal workweek (or in excess of an authorized extended workweek) which cannot be regularly scheduled in advance; or
              (B) Regularly scheduled work in excess of the normal workweek for a period of four consecutive weeks or less; and
              (ii) Establish controls to assure that any use of any extended workweek schedule is in the best interest of the Government. Extended workweek means a workweek regularly scheduled and established in excess of the normal workweek for a period in excess of four consecutive weeks.

              (a) The Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs of the Department of Labor has been delegated authority and responsibility for carrying out the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended. In conjunction with the delegation, contracting officers shall be familiar with existing and any updated provisions of 41 CFR Ch. 60, and assist the Department of Labor in its compliance responsibilities. DOE contracting officers will include the applicable Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)) and Affirmative Action Program (AAP) requirements in their solicitations and obtain the applicable reports of compliance from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) (when required) prior to awarding of contracts. The provisions of 41 CFR Ch. 60, are applicable to all DOE contracts.
              (d) The OFCCP requires that requests for pre-award clearances be directed to the OFCCP Regional Office in which the contractor's facility is (to be) located. If OFCCP finds the contractor in compliance, the contracting officer will be notified. Findings of non-compliance can be communicated to the contracting officer by the OFCCP or Headquarters Director or his designee. The appropriate Regional Office will provide the appropriate contact point in cases of non-compliance. The Director, Office of Civil Rights (DOE HQ), when requested, will provide assistance to contracting officers resolving non-compliance issues by providing assistance in obtaining a final decision from the OFCCP.

              In the event a prospective contractor or subcontractor is entering into its first contract containing the Equal Opportunity clause, the contracting officer shall determine that the prospective contractor understands and appears able to conform to the requirements of the EEO clause.
            
            
              922.804-2
              Construction.
              (a) Construction contracts, including cost-sharing contracts, are subject to OFCCP orders applicable in particular areas.
              (1) When a proposed nonexempt construction contract is within a geographic area where construction is subject to the provisions of Federal EEO Bid Conditions, Part I or Part II, the solicitation shall contain those bid conditions. The contracting officer shall include in such solicitation a provision that “the offeror shall adhere to the affirmative action plan (bid conditions) set forth in this solicitation.”
              (2) Lists of areas for which OFCCP has designated specific affirmative action requirements are available through the Procurement Executive. Contracting officers should assure that this list and copies of pertinent orders are made available to all concerned DOE offices and to DOE contractors and construction subcontractors for work to be performed in the specified geographical areas.
              (b) Other nonexempt construction contracts. (1) When a proposed nonexempt construction contract is not in a “plan area” and is in the amount of $10,000 or more, offerors must agree to comply with the Equal Employment Opportunity clause.
              (2) When proposed nonexempt contracts of $1,000,000 or over are not in plan areas and have not been designated as high impact, offerors also must submit to the contracting officer details regarding specific affirmative action steps to be taken by the offeror in connection with all work under the contract. Such details shall include estimates of the percentage of minority group persons expected to be employed in each craft involved in the performance of the contract work. All solicitations for construction contracts shall reference the affirmative action requirements and the offeror's obligation to make good faith efforts to employ women in craft positions.

              (3) Pursuant to the OFCCP order dated August 30, 1976, agencies shall develop “Special Bid Conditions” for use on high impact projects in non-plan areas. These special bid conditions will include mandatory goals and timetables for the utilization of minorities. The Procurement Executive using the criteria issued by OFCCP will determine those projects that are “high impact.” The contracting officer is responsible for compliance with policies and procedures contained in the OFCCP “Construction Compliance Program Operations Manual.” Language for inclusion in solicitations or contracts contained in the manual may be modified, provided all of the requirements are retained. The contracting officer shall develop the goals and timetables and shall confer with the appropriate OFCCP regional office. The Office of Civil Rights will provide assistance as necessary, when requested. Special bid conditions will be submitted by the contracting officer to the appropriate OFCCP regional office for approval unless otherwise directed by the Procurement Executive. When special bid conditions are applicable, adequate presolicitation lead time should be allowed for submission of the special bid conditions to OFCCP national and regional offices.
              (c) An attempt to limit in any major respect the equal opportunity requirements included in an invitation for bids or request for proposals for a construction contract shall constitute grounds for a determination that the offeror does not qualify as a responsible offeror and for rejection of the bid or proposal. In the case of construction acquisition by DOE prime contractors, this determination shall be made only with the approval of the DOE contracting officer.

              Nuclear safety.
              The DOE regulates the nuclear safety of its major facilities under its own statutory authority derived from the Atomic Energy Act and other legislation. The DOE also regulates, under certain specific conditions, the use by its contractors of radioactive materials and ionizing radiation producing machines.

              923.7002
              Worker safety and health.

              (a)(1) Except when the clause prescribed at 970.1504-8(c) is used, the clauses entitled “952.223-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health” or “952.223-77, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Protection of Worker Safety and Health” implement the requirements of section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act for the use of a contract clause that provides for an appropriate reduction in the fee or amount paid to the contractor under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any Departmental regulation relating to the enforcement of worker safety and health concerns. The clauses, in part, provide for reductions in the amount of fee, profit, or share of cost savings that is otherwise earned by the contractor for performance failures relating to worker safety and health violations under the Department's regulations.
              (2) The clauses provide for reductions of fee or profit that is earned by the contractor depending upon the severity of the contractor's failure to comply with contract terms or conditions relating to worker safety and health concerns. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a reduction of earned fee, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clauses. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are specified in the clauses.
              (3) The contracting officer must obtain the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity—
              (i) Prior to effecting any reduction of fee or amounts otherwise payable to the contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of the clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health” or of the clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Protection of Worker Safety and Health”; and
              (ii) For determinations that no reduction of fee is warranted for a particular performance failure(s) that would otherwise warrant a reduction.
              (4) Section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act provides that DOE shall either pursue civil penalties (implemented at 10 CFR part 851) for a violation under section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2282c) or a contract fee reduction, but not both.
              (5) The contracting officer must coordinate with the Office of Price Anderson Enforcement within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Safety and Security (or with any designated successor office) before pursuing a contract fee reduction in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any Departmental regulation relating to the enforcement of worker health and safety concerns.

              923.7003
              Contract clauses.
              (a) A decision to include or not include environmental, safety and health clauses in DOE contracts shall be made by the contracting officer in consultation with appropriate Office of Health, Safety and Security personnel.
              (b) When work is to be performed at a facility where the DOE will exercise its statutory authority to enforce occupational safety and health standards applicable to the working conditions of the contractor and subcontractor employees at such facility, the clause at 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, shall be used in such contract or subcontract if conditions (b)(1) through (3), are satisfied—
              (1) DOE work is segregated from the contractor's or subcontractor's other work;
              (2) The operation is of sufficient size to support its own safety and health services; and
              (3) The facility is government-owned, or leased by or for the account of the government.

              (c) In facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and which are a production or utilization facility where there is use or possession of source, special nuclear, or byproduct materials, DOE policy is not to enforce radiological safety and health standards pursuant to the contract or subcontract but rather to rely upon Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing requirements (including agreements with States under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act). Pursuant to this policy, neither the clause found at 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, nor 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, is to be incorporated in the contracts or subcontracts for work at such facilities. Notwithstanding this general policy with respect to facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary or his designee may determine in special cases, that DOE needs to enforce radiological safety and health standards pursuant to the contract or subcontract (see paragraph (d) of this section). When such a determination is made, the clause found at 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be included in the contract or subcontract.
              (d) In facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and where there is a machine capable of producing ionizing radiation, it is DOE policy not to regulate such activity where it is adequately regulated by a State or other Federal agency. In such cases, neither clause 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, nor 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be incorporated in the contract. Where the contracting officer, with appropriate environmental, safety and health advice determines that no State or other Federal agency exists to adequately regulate the operation and/or use of such machines, the clause found at 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, shall be included in the contract. The Assistant Secretary for Health, Safety and Security (or designee) shall be consulted to determine if a non-agreement State or a facility located in a non-agreement State has been reviewed by any other DOE office to establish that the State agency has the essential authority and resources for enforcing the radiation protection standards. This is to assure reasonable consistency in the assessment of radiation protection in non-agreement States and subsequent use of 952.223-72.
              (e) In a situation where the contractor or subcontractor is performing DOE work at more than one location, inclusion of either, or both, 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, and 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality, may be appropriate. In such cases, the contract or subcontract must include language to specify the extent of applicability of each clause used. For example, with a parenthetical: (Applicable only to work performed at a contractor site which has 952.223-71 or 952.223-72 clause in its contract or subcontract).
              (f) Except as prescribed in 970.1504-8(c), the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.223-76, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health, in all contracts that contain both the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, and the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement.
              (g) Except as prescribed in 970.1504-8(c), the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.223-77, Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Protection of Worker Safety and Health, in all contracts that do not contain the clause at 952.204-2, Security Requirements, but that do contain the clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement.
              (h) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.223-75, Preservation of Individual Occupational Radiation Exposure Records, in contracts containing 952.223-71, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution, or 952.223-72, Radiation Protection and Nuclear Criticality.

                Costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities, as used in this subpart, means any cost associated with the compliance with regulatory requirements governing the decommissioning of nuclear facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Such costs for foreign facilities and for Department of Energy facilities are costs of decommissioning associated with the compliance with foreign regulatory requirements or the Department's own requirements.
              
                Costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste, as used in this subpart, means any costs, whether required by regulation or incurred as a matter of prudent business practice, associated with the storage or disposal of nuclear waste.
              
                Foreign company, as used in this subpart, means a company which offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility which is not subject to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, and its political subdivisions.
              
                Nuclear hot cell services, as used in this subpart, means services related to the examination of, or performance of various operations on, nuclear fuel rods, control assemblies, or other components that are emitting large quantities of ionizing radiation, after discharge from nuclear reactors, which are performed in specialized facilities located away from commercial nuclear power plants, generally referred to in the industry as “hot cells.”
              
                Nuclear waste, as used in this subpart, means any radioactive waste material subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the Department of Energy, or in the case of foreign offers, by comparable foreign organizations.
              
                United States company, as used in this subpart, means a company which offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility subject to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, and its political subdivisions.

              Policy.
              In selecting offer(s) for award of contracts for nuclear hot cell services, costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and storage and disposal of nuclear waste are to be considered in a way which affords United States and foreign companies an equal competition in accordance with 925.7003. Upon determining that no offer from a foreign firm has a reasonable chance of being selected for award, the requirements of this subpart will not apply.
            
            
              925.7003
              Requirements.
              (a) For the acquisition of nuclear hot cell services under the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, the selection official in evaluating competitive offers for selection purposes only shall—
              (1) Consider neither costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear waste facilities nor costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste; or
              (2) Add these costs to offers of foreign companies.
              (b) The requirements of this section apply under the following circumstances—
              (1) One or more of the offers is submitted by a United States company and includes costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste because it is subject to such costs; and
              (2) One or more of the offers is submitted by a foreign company and does not include these types of costs. (A foreign company might not be subject to such costs or might not have to include these types of costs in its offer if the firm is subsidized in decommissioning activity or storage and disposal of nuclear waste, or a foreign government is performing the activities below the actual cost of the activity.)

              (b) Export control laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), as amended; the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.); the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.), as continued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (Title II of Pub. L. 95-223, 91 Stat. 1626, October 28, 1977; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.); Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 5(b), as amended by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961); Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities (Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 810); Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774); International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 130); Export and Import of Nuclear Equipment and Material (10 CFR part 110); and regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury (31 CFR parts 500 through 598).

              (c) Contractors seeking guidance on how to comply with export control laws and regulations should review the illustrative list of laws and regulations set forth in Clause 952.225-71. Contractors also may contact the agencies responsible for administration of export laws or regulations applicable to a particular export (e.g., Departments of State, Commerce, Treasury and Energy, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission).
              (d) DOE Contracting Officers will not answer contractor questions regarding how to comply with U.S. export laws and regulations. Contracting Officers should direct contractors to the export laws, regulations, and agencies cited in the Export Clause at section 952.225-71 of this subpart.
              (e) It is the contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations. This responsibility exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, this subpart.

              926.7001
              Policy.
              (a) Section 3021(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486) specifies that the Department of Energy (DOE) shall, to the extent practicable, provide that not less than 10 percent of the total combined amounts obligated for competitively awarded contracts and subcontracts under the Energy Policy Act be expended with—
              (1) Small business concerns controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or by women;
              (2) Historically Black colleges and universities; or
              (3) Colleges and universities having a student body in which more than 20 percent of the students are Hispanic Americans or Native Americans.
              (b) These three groups are collectively referred to in this section as “Energy Policy Act target groups.”
              (c) Awards of Energy Policy Act procurements should be in the following descending order of preference—
              (1) Competitive awards pursuant to a set-aside for small disadvantaged business;
              (2) Competitive awards to small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and by women for Energy Policy Act requirements under the Small Business Administration's section 8(a) program; and
              (3) Competitive awards that provide an evaluation preference in accordance with 926.7006 to offerors from the Energy Policy Act target groups.
              (d) The DOE implementation of Section 3021 requirements with regard to the award of subcontracts under Energy Policy Act procurements is discussed at 926.7006.
              (e) Competitive procedures, for purposes of Energy Policy Act implementation, consist of awards under set-asides to small disadvantaged business and firms certified as 8(a) Small Business Administration and competitive procedures in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 15.6 and subpart 915.6.

              Responsibilities.
              Offices initiating procurement requests have primary responsibility to identify potential contract requirements falling within the scope of section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act. Identification shall occur at the earliest possible point in time in the acquisition cycle, but not later than the submission of the procurement request to the contracting officer. For purposes of Section 3021, a contract requirement is any award that directly satisfies an Energy Policy Act program or requirement.
            
            
              926.7003
              Review of the procurement request.
              Any Energy Policy Act procurement, including basic research contracts with educational institutions, shall be reviewed in accordance with the Small Business and 8(a) Program Review Procedures in order to ensure that full consideration is given to the potential for making Energy Policy Act awards.

              926.7005
              Preferences under the Energy Policy Act.
              (a) Prime contracts. Solicitations for all competitive Energy Policy Act procurements not for 8(a) firms and in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold shall provide for an evaluation preference for offers received from entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups. The evaluation criteria shall provide that in instances in which two or more proposals being considered for final selection are ranked as essentially equal after consideration of all technical and cost evaluation factors, and if one of these proposals is from an offeror from among an Energy Policy Act target group that offeror will be selected for award.
              (b) Subcontracts. (1) The contracting officer shall assure that all competitive Energy Policy Act solicitations over the simplified acquisition threshold contain—
              (i) A solicitation provision providing for consideration of the extent to which the offerors have provided for subcontracting opportunities to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups; and
              (ii) A clause providing for the maximum utilization of entities from among Energy Policy Act target groups in the performance of Energy Policy Act contracts.
              (2) In addition, the contracting officer shall assure that all competitive Energy Policy Act procurements expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) include a clause for reporting after award as part of the Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan process.

              Goal measurement and reporting requirements.
              (a) General. The following types of contract awards for Energy Policy Act procurements shall be counted toward achievement by DOE of the 10 percent goal—
              (1) Any award set-aside for small disadvantaged business;
              (2) Any competitive section 8(a) award;
              (3) Any competitive award to one of the three target groups under an unrestricted procurement;
              (4) Any award to one of the three target groups conducted under simplified acquisition procedures in excess of the micro-purchase threshold; and,
              (5) Any competitively awarded subcontract to one of the three target groups under a prime award.
              (b) Prime contract awards. Award values and dollars obligated under prime contracts and modifications to prime contracts for Energy Policy Act requirements shall be reported through the Department of Energy Procurement and Assistance Data System.
              (c) Subcontract awards. The contractor shall be required to report, on an annual Federal Government fiscal year basis, its progress against Section 3021 goals by providing the actual dollar value of subcontract payments and the relationship of those payments to the incurred contract cost. If the contract includes reporting requirements under 48 CFR 52.219-9, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan, the contractor's progress against the Section 3021 goals shall be included as an addendum to Standard Form (SF) 294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts, and/or SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report, as applicable, for the period that corresponds to the end of the Federal Government fiscal year.

              Policy.
              Consistent with the requirements of Section 3161(c)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7474h(c)(2), in instances where DOE has determined that a change in workforce at a DOE Defense Nuclear Facility is necessary, the Department, to the extent practicable, is required to provide employees under Department of Energy contracts whose employment in positions at such a facility is terminated with a preference in any hiring of the Department. Consistent with published DOE guidance regarding Section 3161, such preference in hiring extends to hiring by DOE contractors and subcontractors.
            
            
              926.7102
              Definition.
              
                Eligible employee means a current or former employee of a contractor or subcontractor employed at a DOE Defense Nuclear Facility—
              (1) Whose position of employment has been, or will be, involuntarily terminated (except if terminated for cause);
              (2) Who has met the eligibility criteria contained in Department of Energy guidance for contractor work force restructuring, as may be amended or supplemented from time to time; and
              (3) Who is qualified for a job vacancy with the Department or one of its contractors with respect to work under its contract with the Department at the time a position is available.

              926.7103
              Requirements.
              (a) Section 3161, 42 U.S.C. 7474h, confers a continuing right to a preference in hiring to an eligible employee of Department of Energy Defense Nuclear Facilities. This right to a preference in hiring includes employment opportunities of any Department of Energy contractor, regardless of the place of performance of the contract. Accordingly, eligible former employees of contractors and subcontractors employed at Department of Energy Defense Nuclear Facilities, to the extent practicable, shall be provided a hiring preference in employment opportunities of other Department of Energy contractors for work under their contracts.
              (b) The Office of Worker and Community Transition (WT) is responsible for establishing policies and procedures relating to the Department of Energy implementation of Section 3161. Contracting Officers, in concert with representatives of the field office responsible for implementation of Section 3161 at the Department of Energy Defense Nuclear Facility and local counsel, should consult with the Office of Worker and Community Transition to determine applicability of Section 3161 requirements, including hiring preference requirements, for displaced workers.

              When consulting 48 CFR part 27, subpart 27.2 of the FAR, consider “research, development, and demonstration” to replace the phrase “research and development” or “R&D,” for the purposes of DOE actions.

              General.
              In certain contracting situations, such as those involving research, development, or demonstration projects, consideration should be given to the impact of third party-owned patents covering technology that may be incorporated in the project which patents may ultimately affect widespread commercial use of the project results. In such situations, Patent Counsel shall be consulted to determine what modifications, if any, are to be made to the utilization of the Authorization and Consent and Patent Indemnity provisions or what other action might be deemed appropriate.

              927.206-1
              General.
              The clause at 952.227-9, Refund of Royalties, obligates the contractor to inform DOE of the payment of royalties pertaining to the use of intellectual property, either patent or data related, in the performance of the contract. This information may result in identification of instances in which the Government already has a license for itself or others acting in its behalf or the right to sublicense others. Also, there may be pending antitrust actions or challenges to the validity of a patent or the proprietary nature of the data, or the contractor may be able to gain unrestricted access to the same data through other sources. In such situations the contractor may avoid the payment of a royalty in its entirety or may be charged a reduced royalty.

              Unauthorized disclosure of classified subject matter, whether in a patent application or resulting from the issuance of a patent, may be a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, other laws relating to espionage and national security, and provisions of the proposed contract pertaining to disclosure of information.
            
          
          
            Subpart 927.3—Patent Rights Under Government Contracts
            
              927.300
              General.
              (a) One of the primary missions of the Department of Energy is the use of its procurement process to ensure the conduct of research, development, and demonstration leading to the ultimate commercialization of efficient sources of energy. To accomplish its mission, DOE must work in cooperation with industry in the development of new energy sources and in achieving the ultimate goal of widespread commercial use of those energy sources. To this end, Congress has provided DOE with the authority to invoke an array of incentives to secure the commercialization of new technologies developed for DOE. One such important incentive is provided by the patent system.
              (b) Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2182 and 42 U.S.C. 5908, DOE takes title to all inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under contracts with large, for-profit companies, foreign organizations, and others not beneficiaries of Pub. L. 96-517. Regulations dealing with Department's authority to waive its title to subject inventions, including the relevant statutory objectives, exist at 10 CFR part 784. Pursuant to that section, DOE may waive the Government's patent rights in appropriate situations at the time of contracting to encourage industrial participation, foster commercial utilization and competition, and make the benefits of DOE activities widely available to the public. In addition to considering the waiver of patent rights at the time of contracting, DOE will also consider the incentive of a waiver of patent rights upon the reporting of an identified invention when requested by such entities or by the employee-inventor with the permission of the contractor. These requests can be made whether or not a waiver request was made at the time of contracting. Waivers for identified inventions will be granted where it is determined that the patent waiver will be a meaningful incentive to achieving the development and ultimate commercial utilization of inventions. Where DOE grants a waiver of the Government's patent rights, either at the time of contracting or after an invention is made, certain minimum rights and obligations will be required by DOE to protect the public interest.
              (c) Another major DOE mission is to manage the nation's nuclear weapons and other classified programs, where research and development procurements are directed toward processes and equipment not available to the public. To accomplish DOE programs for bringing private industry into these and other special programs to the maximum extent permitted by national security and policy considerations, it is desirable that the technology developed in these programs be made available on a selected basis for use in the particular fields of interest and under controlled conditions by properly cleared industrial and scientific research institutions. To ensure such availability and control, the grant of waivers in these programs may necessarily be more limited, either by the imposition of field of use restrictions or national security measures, than in other DOE programs.

              927.302
              Policy.
              (a) Except for contracts with organizations that are beneficiaries of Public Law 96-517, the United States, as represented by DOE, shall normally acquire title in and to any invention or discovery conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under the contract, allowing the contractor to retain a nonexclusive, revocable, paid-up license in the invention and the right to request permission to file an application for a patent and retain title to any ensuing patent in any foreign country in which DOE does not elect to secure patent rights. DOE may approve the request if it determines that such approval would be in the national interest. The contractor's nonexclusive license may be revoked or modified by DOE only to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the invention pursuant to any application for and the grant of an exclusive license in the invention to another party.
              (b) In contracts having as a purpose the conduct of research, development, or demonstration work and in certain other contracts, DOE may need to require those contractors that are not the beneficiaries of Public Law 96-517 to license background patents to ensure reasonable public availability and accessibility necessary to practice the subject of the contract in the fields of technology specifically contemplated in the contract effort. That need may arise where the contractor is not attempting to take the technology resulting from the contract to the commercial marketplace, or is not meeting market demands. The need for background patent rights and the particular rights that should be obtained for either the Government or the public will depend upon the type, purpose, and scope of the contract effort, impact on the DOE program, and the cost to the Government of obtaining such rights.
              (c) Provisions to deal specifically with DOE background patent rights are contained in paragraph (k) of the clause at 952.227-13. That paragraph may be modified with the concurrence of Patent Counsel in order to reflect the equities of the parties in particular contracting situations. Paragraph (k) should normally be deleted for contracts with an estimated cost and fee or price of $250,000 or less and may not be appropriate for certain types of study contracts; for planning contracts; for contracts with educational institutions; for contracts for specialized equipment for in-house Government use, not involving use by the public; and for contracts the work products of which will not be the subject of future procurements by the Government or its contractors.
              (d) The Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property shall:
              (1) Make the determination that whether reported inventions are subject inventions under the patent rights clause of the contract;
              (2) Determine whether and where patent protection will be obtained on inventions;
              (3) Represent DOE before domestic and foreign patent offices;
              (4) Accept assignments and instruments confirmatory of the Government's rights to inventions; and
              (5) Represent DOE in patent, technical data, and copyright matters not specifically reserved to the Head of the Agency or designee.

              Contract clauses.
              (a) In solicitations and contracts for experimental, research, developmental, or demonstration work (but see (FAR) 48 CFR 27.304-3 regarding contracts for construction work or architect-engineer services), the contracting officer shall include the clause:
              (1) At 952.227-13, Patent Rights Acquisition by the Government, in all such contracts other than those described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section;
              (2) At 952.227-11, Patent Rights by the Contractor (Short Form), in contracts in which the contractor is a domestic small business or nonprofit organization as defined at (FAR) 48 CFR 27.301, except where the work of the contract is subject to an Exceptional Circumstances Determination by DOE; and

              (3) At 970.5227-10, 970.5227-11, or 970.5227-12, as discussed in 970.27, Patent, Data, and Copyrights, in contracts for the management and operation of DOE laboratories and production facilities.
              (b) DOE shall not use the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.227-12 except in situations where patent counsel grants a request for advance waiver pursuant to 10 CFR part 784 and supplies the contracting officer with that clause with appropriate modifications. Otherwise, in instances in which DOE grants an advance waiver or waives its rights in an identified invention pursuant to 10 CFR part 784, contracting officers shall consult with patent counsel for the appropriate clause.

              (c) Any contract that has as a purpose the design, construction, operation, or management integration of a collection of contracts for the same purpose, of a Government-owned research, development, demonstration or production facility must accord the Government certain rights with respect to further use of the facility by or on behalf of the Government upon termination of the contract. The patent rights clause in such contracts must include the following facilities license paragraph:
              
              
                [Insert appropriate paragraph no.] Facilities License. In addition to the rights of the parties with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice or acquired by the Contractor at any time through completion of this contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or which cover articles, materials, or products manufactured at the facility (1) to practice or have practiced by or for the Government at the facility, and (2) to transfer such license with the transfer of that facility. Notwithstanding the acceptance or exercise by the Government of these rights, the Government may contest at any time the enforceability, validity or scope of, title to, any rights or patents herein licensed.

              927.400
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart sets forth DOE's policy, procedures, and instructions for contract clauses with respect to the acquisition and use of technical data and copyrights in contracts or subcontracts entered into, with or for the benefit of the Government.

              Acquisition and use of technical data.
            
            
              927.402-1
              General.
              (a) The provisions herein pertain to research, development, demonstration and supply contracts. Special considerations for contracts for the operation, design, or construction of Government-owned facilities are covered by subpart 970.27. Under DOE's broad charter to perform research, development, and demonstration work, in both nuclear and nonnuclear fields, and to meet the objectives stated in 927.402-2, DOE has extensive needs for technical data. The satisfaction of these needs and the achievement of DOE's objectives through a sound data policy are found in the balancing of the needs and equities of the Government, its contractors, and the general public.

              (b) It is important to keep a clear distinction between contract requirements for the delivery of technical data and rights in technical data. The legal rights which the Government acquires in technical data in DOE contracts, other than management and operating contracts (see 48 CFR 970.2704) and other contracts involving the production of data necessary for the management or operation of DOE facilities or a DOE site, are set forth in Rights in Data—General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14 as modified in accordance with 927.409 of this subpart. In those contracts involving the production of data necessary for the management or operation of DOE facilities or a DOE site, after consultation with Patent Counsel the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1 shall be used. However, those clauses do not obtain for the Government delivery of any data whatsoever. Rather, known requirements for the technical data to be delivered by the contractor shall be set forth as part of the contract. The Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 may be used along with the Rights in Data—General clause to enable the contracting officer to require the contractor to furnish additional technical data, the requirement for which was not known at the time of contracting. There is, however, a built-in limitation on the kind of technical data which a contractor may be required to deliver under either the contract or the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause. This limitation is found in the withholding provision of paragraph (g) of the Rights in Data—General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, as amended at 48 CFR 927.409(a), which provides that the Contractor need not furnish limited rights data or restricted computer software. Unless Alternate II or III to the Rights in Data—General clause is used, it is specifically intended that the contractor may withhold limited rights data or restricted computer software even though a requirement for technical data specified in the contract or called for delivery pursuant to the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause would otherwise require the delivery of such data.
              (c) In contracts involving access to certain categories of DOE-owned restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related data and technology. Accordingly, in contracts where access to such restricted data is to be provided to contractors, the following parenthetical phrase shall be inserted after “contract data” in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of the clause at 952.227-75, after “technical data” in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at 952.227-77, or after “technical data” in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of the clause at 952.227-78 as appropriate: “(except Restricted Data in category C-24, 10 CFR part 725, in which DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including related data and technology).” In addition, there are other types of contract situations (e.g., no cost contracts for studies or evaluation) wherein the contractor is given access to restricted data. In such contract situations, limitations on the use of such data may be appropriate.

              927.402-2
              Policy.
              The technical data policy is directed toward achieving the following objectives:
              (a) Making the benefits of the energy research, development and demonstration programs of DOE widely available to the public in the shortest practicable time;
              (b) Promoting the commercial utilization of the technology developed under DOE programs;
              (c) Encouraging participation by private persons in DOE energy research, development, and demonstration programs; and
              (d) Fostering competition and preventing undue market concentration or the creation or maintenance of other situations inconsistent with the antitrust laws.
            
            
              927.403
              Negotiations and deviations.

              Contracting officers shall contact Patent Counsel assisting their contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in selecting, negotiating, or approving appropriate data and copyright clauses in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart and 48 CFR part 27.4. In particular, contracting officers shall seek the prompt and timely advice of Patent Counsel regarding any situation not in conformance with this subpart and prescribed clauses, including the inclusion or modification of alternate paragraphs of the Rights in Data clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, as amended at 48 CFR 927.409(a), the exclusion of specific items from said clause, the exclusion of the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16, and the inclusion of any special provisions in a particular contract.

              927.404
              Rights in technical data in subcontracts. (DOE coverage—paragraphs (g), (k), (l), and (m))
              (g)(4) Contractors are required by paragraph (d)(3) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, as modified pursuant to 48 CFR 927.409(a)(1), to acquire permission from DOE to assert copyright in any computer software first produced in the performance of the contract. This requirement reflects DOE's established software distribution program, recognized at FAR 27.404(g)(2), and the Department's statutory dissemination obligations. When a contractor requests permission to assert copyright in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of the Rights in Data—General clause as prescribed for use at 48 CFR 927.409(a)(1), Patent Counsel shall predicate its decision on the considerations reflected in paragraph (e) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2 Rights in Data—Technology Transfer.
              (k) Subcontracts. (1)(i) It is the responsibility of prime contractors and higher tier subcontractors, in meeting their obligations with respect to contract data, to obtain from their subcontractor the rights in, access to, and delivery of such data on behalf of the Government. Accordingly, subject to the policy set forth in this subpart, and subject to the approval of the contracting officer, where required, selection of appropriate technical data provisions for subcontracts is the responsibility of the prime contractors or higher-tier subcontractors. In many, but not all instances, use of the Rights in Technical Data clause of FAR 52.227-14, as modified pursuant to 48 CFR 927.409(a)(1), in a subcontract will provide for sufficient Government rights in and access to technical data. The inspection rights afforded in Alternate V of that clause normally should be obtained only in first-tier subcontracts having as a purpose the conduct of research, development, or demonstration work or the furnishing of supplies for which there are substantial technical data requirements as reflected in the prime contract.
              (ii) If a subcontractor refuses to accept technical data provisions affording rights in and access to technical data on behalf of the Government, the contractor shall so inform the contracting officer in writing and not proceed with the award of the subcontract without written authorization of the contracting officer.
              (iii) In prime contracts (or higher-tier subcontracts) which contain the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at FAR 52.227-16, it is the further responsibility of the contractor (or higher-tier subcontractor) to determine whether inclusion of such clause in a subcontract is required to satisfy technical data requirements of the prime contract (or higher-tier subcontract).
              (2) As is the case for DOE in its determination of technical data requirements, the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at FAR 52.227-16 should not be used at any subcontracting tier where the technical data requirements are fully known. Normally, the clause will be used only in subcontracts having as a purpose the conduct of research, development, or demonstration work. Prime contractors and higher-tier subcontractors shall not use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in the subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use, and they shall not acquire rights to limited rights data or restricted computer software on behalf of the Government for standard commercial items without the prior approval of Patent Counsel.
              (l) Contractor licensing. In many contracting situations the achievement of DOE's objectives would be frustrated if the Government, at the time of contracting, did not obtain on behalf of responsible third parties and itself limited license rights in and to limited rights data or restricted computer software or both necessary for the practice of subject inventions or data first produced or delivered in the performance of the contract. Where the purpose of the contract is research, development, or demonstration, contracting officers should consult with program officials and Patent Counsel to consider whether such rights should be acquired. No such rights should be obtained from a small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in background inventions of the small business or non-profit organization have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). In all cases when the contractor has agreed to include a provision assuring commercial availability of background patents, consideration should be given to securing for the Government and responsible third parties at reasonable royalties and under appropriate restrictions, co-extensive license rights for data which are limited rights data and restricted computer software. When such license rights are deemed necessary, the Rights in Data-General clause at FAR 52.227-14 should be supplemented by the addition of Alternate VI as provided at 48 CFR 952.227-14. Alternate VI will normally be sufficient to cover limited rights data and restricted computer software for items and processes that were used in the contract and are necessary in order to insure widespread commercial use or practical utilization of a subject of the contract. The expression “subject of the contract” is intended to limit the licensing required in Alternate VI to the fields of technology specifically contemplated in the contract effort and may be replaced by a more specific statement of the fields of technology intended to be covered in the manner described in the patent clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13 pertaining to “Background Patents.” Where, however, limited rights data and restricted computer software cover the main purpose or basic technology of the research, development, or demonstration effort of the contract, rather than subcomponents, products, or processes which are ancillary to the contract effort, the limitations set forth in subparagraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of Alternate VI of 48 CFR 952.227-14 should be modified or deleted. Paragraph (k) of 48 CFR 952.227-14 further provides that limited rights data or restricted computer software may be specified in the contract as being excluded from or not subject to the licensing requirements thereof. This exclusion can be implemented by limiting the applicability of the provisions of paragraph (k) of 48 CFR 952.227-14 to only those classes or categories of limited rights data and restricted computer software determined as being essential for licensing. Although contractor licensing may be required under paragraph (k) of 48 CFR 952.227-14, the final resolution of questions regarding the scope of such licenses and the terms thereof, including provisions for confidentiality, and reasonable royalties, is then left to the negotiation of the parties.
              (m) Access to restricted data. In contracts involving access to certain categories of DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related data and technology. Accordingly, in contracts where access to such restricted data is to be provided to contractors, Alternate VII shall be incorporated into the rights in technical data clause of the contract. In addition, in any other types of contracting situations in which the contractor may be given access to restricted data, appropriate limitations on the use of such data must be specified.

              927.404-70
              Statutory programs.

              Occasionally, Congress enacts legislation that authorizes or requires the Department to protect from public disclosure specific data first produced in the performance of the contract. Examples of such programs are “the Metals Initiative” and section 3001(d) of the Energy Policy Act. In such cases DOE Patent Counsel is responsible for providing the appropriate contractual provisions for protecting the data in accordance with the statute. Generally, such clauses will be based upon the Rights in Data-General clause prescribed for use at 48 CFR 927.409(a) with appropriate modifications to define and protect the “protected data” in accordance with the applicable statute. When contracts under such statutes are to be awarded, contracting officers must acquire from Patent Counsel the appropriate contractual provisions. Additionally, the contracting officer must consult with DOE program personnel and Patent Counsel to identify data first produced in the performance of the contract that will be recognized by the parties as protected data and what data will be made available to the public notwithstanding the statutory authority to withhold the data from public dissemination.

              Cosponsored research and development activities.
              Because of the Department of Energy's statutory duties to disseminate data first produced under its contracts for research, development, and demonstration, the provisions of FAR 27.408 do not apply to cosponsored or cost shared contracts.

When such permission is granted, the Patent Counsel shall specify appropriate terms, conditions, and submission requirements to assure utilization, dissemination, and commercialization of the data. The Contractor, when requested, shall promptly deliver to Patent Counsel a duly executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all rights to which the Government is entitled.
              
              
              (2) However, rights in data in these specific situations will be treated as described, where the contract is—
              (i) For the production of special works of the type set forth in FAR 27.405(a), but the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, shall be included in the contract and made applicable to data other than special works, as appropriate (See paragraph (i) of FAR 27.409);
              (ii) For the acquisition of existing data works, as described in FAR 27.405(b) (See paragraph (j) of FAR 27.409);

              (vii) Awarded pursuant to a statute expressly providing authority for the protection of data first produced thereunder from disclosure or dissemination. (See 927.404-70).
              (h) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, in solicitations and contracts involving experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration work (other than basic or applied research to be performed solely by a university or college where the contract amount will be $500,000 or less) unless all the requirements for data are believed to be known at the time of contracting and specified in the contract. See FAR 27.406(b). This clause may also be used in other contracts when considered appropriate.
              
              (s) Contracting officers shall incorporate the solicitation provision at FAR 52.227-23, Rights to Proposal Data (Technical), in all requests for proposals.

              (1) Pure risk commercial insurance is not available or, if available, cost is not considered reasonable;
              (2) Inherent risks in the contract are new and a part of the process of commercialization;
              (3) The service-type insurance is needed to implement jointly funded projects; or

              (b) The following limitations apply to establishment of advance understandings relative to pre-contract costs:
              (1) Pre-contract cost authorizations shall not be used to cover a period in excess of 15 days, unless a longer period is approved by the HCA based upon a written finding that such an allowance is reasonable, and shall not be extended or renewed. A copy of the findings shall be forwarded to the Senior Procurement Executive at the time of approval. If prolonged coverage is necessary, a letter contract shall be issued.
              (2) All pre-contract cost authorizations shall be reviewed and approved at a management level above the contracting officer.
              (3) Retroactive precontract cost authorization and the predating of contractual agreements shall not be used.

                Employee whistleblower action means any action filed by an employee in Federal or state court for redress of a retaliatory act by a contractor and any administrative procedure initiated by an employee under 29 CFR part 24, 48 CFR subpart 3.9, 10 CFR part 708 or 42 U.S.C. 7239.
              
                Retaliatory act means a discharge, demotion, reduction in pay, coercion, restraint, threat, intimidation or other similar negative action taken against an employee by a contractor as a result of an employee's activity protected as a whistleblower activity by a Federal or state statute or regulation.
              
                Settlement and award costs means defense costs and costs arising from judicial orders, negotiated agreements, arbitration, or an order from a Federal agency or board and includes compensatory damages, underpayment for work performed, and reimbursement for a complainant employee's legal counsel.
              (2) For costs associated with employee whistleblower actions where a retaliatory act is alleged against a covered contractor or subcontractor, the contracting officer—
              (i) May authorize reimbursement of costs on a provisional basis, in appropriate cases;
              (ii) Must consult with the Office of General Counsel whistleblower costs point of contact, who will consult with other Headquarters points of contact as appropriate, before making a final allowability determination; and
              (iii) Must determine allowability of defense, settlement and award costs on a case-by-case basis after considering the terms of the contract, relevant cost regulations, and the relevant facts and circumstances, including federal law and policy prohibiting reprisal against whistleblowers, available at the conclusion of the employee whistleblower action.
              (3) Covered contractors and subcontractors must segregate legal costs, including costs of in-house counsel, incurred in the defense of an employee whistleblower action so that the costs are separately identifiable.
              (4) If a contracting officer provisionally disallows costs associated with an employee whistleblower action for a covered contractor or subcontractor, funds advanced by the Department may not be used to finance costs connected with the defense, settlement and award of an employee whistleblower action.
              (5) Contractor defense, settlement and award costs incurred in connection with the defense of suits brought by employees under section 2 of the Major Fraud Act of 1988 are excluded from coverage of this section.

              Policies.
              (d) In the case of prime contracts, when it has been determined that the financing of contracts will be facilitated in the interest of DOE programs, it is the policy of DOE that such contracts provide, or be amended without consideration (see Assignment of Claims Act of 1940) to provide, in conformance with 48 CFR 32.804, that payments to be made to an assignee shall not be subject to reduction or setoff. In the case of subcontracts, when loans are made for the purpose of financing performance of subcontracts under DOE prime contracts, financing institutions or the Government as guarantor in those instances in which such loans are guaranteed should not be required to incur risks of loss by reason of possible diversion of assigned subcontracts proceeds for payment of other claims of the prime contractor against the borrower, otherwise unrelated to the assigned subcontracts. The Head of the Contracting Activity shall require the adoption of these policies and practices by DOE prime contractors with respect to DOE subcontract work. The Head of the Contracting Activity should inform the Chief Financial Officer, Headquarters of each DOE contractor who is unwilling to adopt policies consistent with this paragraph and the reasons given in support of the contractor's position.

              (a) Invoice payments—(1) Contract settlement date. For purposes of determining any interest penalties under cost-type contracts, the effective date of contract settlement shall be the effective date of the final contract modification issued to acknowledge contract settlement and to close out the contract.
              (2) Constructive acceptance periods. Where the contracting officer determines, in writing, on a case-by-case basis, that it is not reasonable or feasible for DOE to perform the acceptance or approval function within the standard period, the contracting officer should specify a longer constructive acceptance or approval period, as appropriate. Considerations include, but are not limited to, the nature of supplies or services involved, geographical site location, inspection and testing requirements, shipping and acceptance terms, and available DOE resources.
              (b) Contract financing payments. Contracting officers may specify payment due dates that are less than the standard 30 days when a determination is made, in writing, on a case-by-case basis, that a shorter contract financing payment cycle will be required to finance contract work. In such cases, the contracting officer should coordinate with the finance and program officials that will be involved in the payment process to ensure that the contract payment terms to be specified in solicitations and resulting contract awards can be reasonably met. Consideration should be given to geographical separation, workload, contractor ability to submit a proper request, and other factors that could affect timing of payment. However, payment due dates that are less than 7 days for progress payments or less than 14 days for interim payments on cost-type contracts are not authorized.

              932.7002
              Authority.
              Guaranteed loan applications shall be authorized and transmitted to the Federal Reserve Board only by the Secretary, or designee specified for that purpose, and only when made pursuant to enabling legislation or other authority; e.g., by executive order or regulation.
            
            
              932.7003
              Policies.
              The following policies governing the exercise of its loan guarantee authority have been established by DOE:
              (a) The use of the loan guarantee authority is not restricted to contracts or subcontracts of any particular type or class. Each case is to be evaluated on its own merits and under the particular circumstances applicable thereto.
              (b) The fact that a contract has been awarded as a result of competitive bidding should not, of itself, render the loan ineligible for guarantee by DOE if the contractor is financially responsible and its need for working capital is the result of the impact of a defense program or any other DOE program for which guaranteed loans are authorized.
              (c) The guarantee authority should, in general, not be used in connection with loans to contractors required to furnish performance bonds, except in those cases in which the time likely to be required for the surety or DOE to take over in the event of default will result in delays which cannot be tolerated by the particular program concerned. When performance bonds have been furnished, the surety shall be required to subordinate its rights in favor of the guaranteed loan.
              (d) The criterion that the materials or services to be provided cannot readily be acquired from alternative sources does not require the finding that the materials or services are absolutely unobtainable elsewhere. The criterion should be so applied as to permit guarantees of loans when, although the materials or services can be obtained elsewhere, such factors as the urgency of supply schedules, technical capacity of the contractor, comparative prices, and time and expense involved in reissuing the contract, including termination payment, establish that it is to the Government's advantage not to resort to alternative sources merely because the contractor or subcontractor may require a guaranteed loan.
              (e) If it is known at the time the contract is to be awarded that the low offeror who is technically qualified and competent to furnish the required materials and services will require a guaranteed loan, the contracting officer should obtain appropriate advice and in reaching a decision should consider at least the following—
              (1) The savings to be realized by awarding the contract to the low offeror;
              (2) The risk to the Government in guaranteeing a loan; and
              (3) The likelihood, if award is made to the second low offeror, of that offeror's applying for a guaranteed loan at a later date.
              Extreme care should be exercised in rejecting a low bid or proposal simply because the low offeror requires a guaranteed loan.
              (f) The amount of the loan should bear reasonable relationship to such factors as the value and terms of the contract, the probable investment required to be made by the contractor in payrolls and inventories, the frequency with which contract payments are to be made, and the borrower's current working capital position.
              (g) Borrowings for working capital purposes under guaranteed loans shall be limited to the amount necessary to perform the contract for which the loan is sought. In order that the contractor will also use its own funds in the performance of the contracts, amounts outstanding under the loan or line-of-credit shall be limited to an amount not to exceed 90 percent of the borrower's investment in its contracts, regardless of the total amount of the loan or line of credit authorized. The borrower's investment includes all items for which the borrower would be entitled to payment on performance or termination of contracts, but does not include any items for which no work has been done nor expenditures made.

              (h) Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the loan should mature not later than 30 days after the estimated date of final payment under the contract.

              The procedures for authorizing a guaranteed loan under legislation other than section 301 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. App. 2091) shall be essentially the same as those set forth in 48 CFR 32.304, Procedures, 48 CFR 32.305, Loan Guarantees for Terminated Contracts, and 48 CFR 32.306 Loan Guarantee for Subcontacts; except that any contrary provisions required by enabling legislation authorizing the loan shall govern.

              Criteria.
              (a) The materials or services to be furnished by the contractor are necessary to the Government interest.
              (b) The materials or services cannot as a practical matter be obtained from alternate sources without delay or impeding the Government's interest, except that no small business concern shall be held ineligible for the issuance of such guarantee by reason of alternative sources of supply.
              (c) The contractor has demonstrated its inability to obtain the necessary financing in conventional credit channels without the guarantee.
              (d) There is reasonable assurance that the loan can be repaid.
              (e) The contractor is competent to perform the contract.

              (i) Protests filed with the contracting officer before or after award shall be decided by the HCA except for the following cases, which shall be decided by the Senior Procurement Executive:
              (1) The protester requests that the protest be decided by the Senior Procurement Executive.

              (2) The HCA is the contracting officer of record at the time the protest is filed, having signed either the solicitation where the award has not been made, or the contract, where the award or nomination of the apparent successful offeror has been made.
              
              (3) The HCA concludes that one or more of the issues raised in the protest have the potential for significant impact on Department of Energy (DOE) acquisition policy.
              (j) The Department of Energy encourages direct negotiations between an offeror and the contracting officer in an attempt to resolve protests. In those situations where the parties are not able to achieve resolution, the Department favors the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to resolve protests. A protest requesting a decision at the Headquarters level shall state whether the protester is willing to utilize ADR techniques such as mediation or nonbinding evaluation of the protest by a neutral party. Both the protester and the Department must agree that the use of such techniques is appropriate. If the parties do not mutually agree to utilize ADR techniques to resolve the protest, the protest will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (k).
              (k) Upon receipt of a protest lodged with the Department, the contracting officer shall prepare a report similar to that discussed in 48 CFR 33.104(a)(3)(iv). The Senior Procurement Executive (for protests at the Headquarters level or those specific HCA protests cited in paragraph (i) of this section) or an HCA (for protests at the contracting activity level) will render a decision on a protest within 35 calendar days, unless a longer period of time is determined to be needed.

(1) When the Department has received notice from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) of a protest filed directly with the GAO, a contract may not be awarded until the matter is resolved, unless authorized by the HCA in accordance with 48 CFR 33.104(b). Before the HCA authorizes the award, the required finding shall be concurred in by the DOE counsel handling the protest, endorsed by the Senior Program Official, and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive. The finding shall address the likelihood that the protest will be sustained by the GAO.
              (c) Protests after award. Before the HCA authorizes performance, the finding required by 48 CFR 33.104(c)(2) shall be concurred in by the DOE counsel handling the protest, endorsed by the Senior Program Official, and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive.
              (g) Notice to GAO. (1) The report to the GAO regarding a decision not to comply with the GAO's recommendation, discussed at 48 CFR 33.104(f), shall be provided by the HCA making the award, after approval of the Senior Procurement Executive. If a DOE-wide policy issue is involved, the report shall be provided by the Senior Procurement Executive.
              (2) It is the policy of the Department to comply promptly with recommendations set forth in Comptroller General Decisions except for compelling reasons.

            Research misconduct.
            (a) Applicability. The DOE research misconduct policy set forth at 10 CFR part 733 addresses research misconduct by individuals who propose, perform or review research of any kind for the Department of Energy pursuant to a contract. The regulation applies regardless of where the research or other activity is conducted or by whom.
            (b) Definition. Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion. A finding of research misconduct means a determination, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that research misconduct has occurred, including a conclusion that there has been a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and that it be knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly committed.

Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, M&O contractors and their subcontractors shall not be used to acquire information technology unrelated to the mission of the M&O contract either for sole use by DOE employees or employees of other DOE contractors, or for use by other Federal agencies or their contractors.
              (b) Other than M&O contracts. Where it has been determined that a contractor (other than an M&O contractor or its subcontractor) will acquire information technology either for sole use by DOE employees or for the furnishing of the information technology as government-furnished property under another contract, and after receiving written authorization from their cognizant DOE contracting office pursuant to 48 CFR part 51, DOE contractors working under cost-reimbursement-type contracts may place orders against authorized contracts. All authorizations to contractors shall expressly and specifically reference the restriction regarding contractor use of the items acquired, cited at 951.102(e)(4)(iii).
              (c) Consolidated contractor acquisitions. When common information technology requirements in support of DOE programs have been identified and it is anticipated that the consolidation of such requirements will promote cost or other efficiencies, the Designated Senior Official for Information Management may authorize an M&O contractor to acquire information technology for use by the following—
              (1) One or more other contractor(s) performing on-site at the same DOE-owned or -leased facility as the M&O contractor; or
              (2) Other M&O contractors.

              942.704
              Billing rates.
              (b) When the contracting officer or auditor responsible for establishing billing rates, in accordance with 48 CFR 42.704, has not established such rates or such rates are not current for the performance periods (contractor FY) under contract, the DOE contracting officer responsible for administration of the contract shall establish an appropriate rate(s) for billing purposes. If the contractor holds more than one DOE contract covering that period of performance, the DOE office with the largest unliquidated obligations as of the beginning of that performance period shall take the lead in establishing the required billing rate for use on DOE contracts. Once appropriate billing rates are established by the responsible contracting officer designated by 48 CFR 42.704, such rates shall be adopted by the contracting officer and all billings and payments shall be retroactively revised to reflect the agreed upon rate(s).

              (a)(3) The Department of Energy shall use the contracting officer determination procedure for all business units for which it shall be required to negotiate final indirect cost rates. A list of such business units is maintained by the Office of Procurement and Assistance Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.
              (b)(1) Pursuant to 48 CFR 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment, contractors shall be requested to submit their final indirect cost rate proposals reflecting actual cost experience during the covered period to the cognizant contracting officer responsible for negotiating their final rates.
              The DOE negotiating official shall request all needed audit service in accordance with internal procedures.

              942.803
              Disallowing costs after incurrence.
              (a) Contracting officer receipt of vouchers. Vouchers and invoices submitted to DOE shall be submitted to the contracting officer or designee for review and approval for payment. If the examination of a voucher or invoice raises a question regarding the allowability of a cost submitted therein, the contracting officer, shall:
              (1) Hold informal discussion with the contractor as appropriate.
              (2) Issue a notice (letter, memo, etc.) to the contractor advising of cost disallowed or to be disallowed and advising the contractor that it may:
              (i) Submit a written claim as to why the cost should be reimbursed—if in disagreement with the disallowance.
              (ii) File a claim under the disputes clause, which will be processed in accordance with disputes procedures in the event disagreements cannot be settled.
              (3) Process the voucher or invoice for payment and advise the finance office to deduct the disallowed cost when scheduling the voucher for payment.
              (c) Auditor reports and other sources of questioned costs. (1) From time to time reports are received from professional auditors that may question the allowability of an incurred cost. Such reports are received as the result of auditors, in their independent role under OMB Circular A-73 or their own charters, scheduling and conducting financial or compliance audits of government contracts or as the result of an independent request for auditor service.
              
              (2) When auditor reports or other notifications question cost or consider them unallowable, the contracting officer shall follow up such reports and resolve all such cost issues promptly by determining, through discussions with the contractor and/or auditor within six months of the audit report date, or date of receipt if a non-Federal audit. One of the following courses of action shall be pursued:
              (i) Accept and implement audit recommendations as submitted.
              (ii) Accept the principle of the audit recommendation but reject the cost questioned amount.
              (iii) Reject audit findings and recommendations.
              (3) When implementing the accepted course of action, the contracting officer shall—
              (i) Hold discussions with the auditor and contractor as appropriate.
              (ii) Issue a notice in writing advising the contractor of the government's intent to disallow the cost questioned, if the contracting officer agrees with the auditor concerning the questioned costs.
              (iii) Negotiate a mutual settlement of questioned costs if they are agreed with in principle but there is a difference of opinion as to a proper amount.
              (iv) Negotiate a mutual settlement of questioned costs if the auditor recommendations are acceptable to the contracting officer but the contractor does not accept the finding or disallowance.
              (v) Issue a final decision of the contracting officer disallowing the questionable cost where differences cannot be resolved, advising of the contractor's right to appeal the decision, and advising the procedure to be followed if it is decided to make such an appeal.
              (vi) Initiate immediate recoupment actions for all disallowed cost owed the government by:
              (A) Requesting the contractor to provide a credit adjustment (offset) against amounts billed the government on the next or future invoice(s) if such shall be submitted under a contract for which the disallowed cost applies.
              (B) Deducting (offset) the disallowed cost from the next or future invoice(s) submitted under the contract; if the contractor provides no adjustment under the contract for which the disallowed cost applies; provided such reduction is deemed appropriate.
              (C) Advising the contractor that a refund shall be directly payable to the government in situations where there are insufficient payments owed by the government to effect recovery via (A) or (B) above or an offset is otherwise inappropriate.
              (vii) Promptly notify the appropriate finance office of refunds directly payable to the government to ensure proper billing and follow-up action for collection.

              Definitions.
              
                DOE contractor means any DOE prime contractor, including any agency of the Federal Government with which DOE has entered into an interagency agreement.
              
                Nuclear incident means any occurrence, including an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, within the United States causing, within or outside the United States, bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death, or loss of or damage to property, or loss of use of property, arising out of or resulting from the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material. The term includes any such occurrence outside the United States if such occurrence involves source, special nuclear, or byproduct material owned by, and used by or under contract with, the United States.
              
                Person indemnified means—
              (1) With respect to a nuclear incident occurring within the United States or outside the United States as the term is defined above and with respect to any nuclear incident in connection with the design, development, construction, operation, repair, maintenance, or use of the nuclear ship Savannah, the person with whom an indemnity agreement is executed or who is required to maintain financial protection, and any other person who may be liable for public liability; or

              (2) With respect to any other nuclear incident occurring outside the United States, the person with whom an indemnity agreement is executed and any other person who may be liable for public liability by reason of his activities under any contract with the Secretary of Energy or any project to which indemnification under the provisions of section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, has been extended or under any subcontract, purchase order, or other agreement, or any tier under any such contract or project.
              
                Public liability means any legal liability arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation (including all reasonable additional costs incurred by a State, or a political subdivision of a State, in the course of responding to a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation), except: (1) Claims under State or Federal workmen's compensation acts of employees of persons indemnified who are employed at the site of and in connection with the activity where the nuclear incident occurs; (2) claims arising out of an act of war; and (3) whenever used in subsections a., c., and k. of section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, claims for loss of, or damage to, or loss of use of property which is located at the site of and used in connection with the licensed activity where the nuclear incident occurs. Public liability also includes damage to property of persons indemnified: Provided, that such property is covered under the terms of the financial protection required, except property which is located at the site of and used in connection with the activity where the nuclear incident occurs.

              Nuclear hazards indemnity.
              (a) Section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, requires DOE “to enter into agreements of indemnification with any person who may conduct activities under a contract with DOE that involve the risk of public liability * * *.” However, DOE contractors whose activities are already subject to indemnification by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are not eligible for such statutory indemnity. See 950.7006 below.
              (b) The Heads of Contracting Activities shall assure that contracts subject to this requirement contain the appropriate nuclear hazards indemnity provisions.
              [56 FR 57828, Nov. 14, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 9108, Feb. 25, 1994; 75 FR 29459, May 26, 2010]

              (a) The contract clause contained in 952.250-70 shall be incorporated in all contracts in which the contractor is under risk of public liability for a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation arising out of or in connection with the contract work, including such events caused by a product delivered to a DOE-owned facility for use by DOE or its contractors. The clause at 952.250-70 shall be included in contracts with architect-engineer contractors for the design of a DOE facility, the construction or operation of which may involve the risk of public liability for a nuclear incident or a precautionary evacuation.
              (b) However, this clause shall not be included in contracts in which the contractor is subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) financial protection requirements under section 170b. of the Act or NRC agreements of indemnification under section 170c. or k. of the Act for activities to be performed under the contract.

              Financial protection requirements.

              DOE contractors with whom statutory nuclear hazards indemnity agreements under the authority of section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, are executed will not normally be required or permitted to furnish financial protection by purchase of insurance to cover public liability for nuclear incidents. However, if authorized by the DOE Headquarters office having responsibility for contractor casualty insurance programs, DOE contractors may be (a) permitted to furnish financial protection to themselves or (b) permitted to continue to carry such insurance at cost to the Government if they currently maintain insurance for such liability.

            Subpart 950.71—General Contract Authority Indemnity
            
              950.7101
              Applicability.
              (a) The DOE also has general contract authority to enter into indemnity agreements with its contractors. Under such authority a certain measure of protection is extended to the DOE contractor against risk of liability, but the assumption of liability by DOE will be expressly subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Prior to enactment of section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act 1954, as amended, this authority was exercised in a number of Atomic Energy Commission contracts and this type of indemnification remains in some DOE contracts.
              (b) It is the policy of the DOE, subsequent to the enactment of section 170, to restrict indemnity agreements with DOE contractors, with respect to protection against public liability for a nuclear incident, to the statutory indemnity provided under section 170. However, it is recognized that circumstances may exist under which a DOE contractor may be exposed to a risk of public liability for a nuclear occurrence which would not be covered by the statutory indemnity.
              (c) While it is normally DOE policy to require its non-management and operating contractors to obtain insurance coverage against public liability for nonnuclear risks, there may be circumstances in which a contractual indemnity may be warranted to protect a DOE non-management and operating contractor against liability for uninsured nonnuclear risks.
              (d) If circumstances as mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section do arise, it shall be the responsibility of the Heads of Contracting Activities to submit to the Head of the Agency or designee for review and decision, all pertinent information concerning the need for, or desirability of, providing a general authority indemnity to a DOE contractor.
              (e) Where the indemnified risk is nonnuclear, the amount of general authority indemnity extended to a fixed-price contractor should normally have a maximum obligation equivalent to the amount of insurance that the contractor usually carries to cover such risks in its other commercial operations or, if the risk involved is dissimilar to those normally encountered by the contractor, the amount that it otherwise would have reasonably procured to insure this contract risk.
              (f) In the event that a DOE contractor has been extended both a statutory indemnity and a general authority indemnity, the general authority indemnity will not apply to the extent that the statutory indemnity applies.
              (g) The provisions of this subsection do not restrict or affect the policy of DOE to pay its cost-reimbursement type contractors for the allowable cost of losses and expenses incurred in the performance of the contact work, within the maximum amount of the contract obligation.

              (a) It is Department of Energy (DOE) policy that contractors performing under cost-reimbursement contracts should meet their requirements from Government sources of supply when these sources are available to them, and if it is economically advantageous or otherwise in the best interest of the Government.

              951.102
              Authorization to use Government supply sources.
              (a) The Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize contractors performing under cost-reimbursement contracts and subcontractors performing under cost-reimbursement subcontracts, where all higher tier contracts and subcontracts are cost-type, to use Government supply sources in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 48 CFR part 51, DOE PMR 41 CFR 109, and any necessary approval from the agency involved. This authority may be redelegated to the level of contracting officer. Direct acquisition by the DOE, rather than by a contractor under cost-reimbursement contracts, shall be required where deemed necessary by the Head of the Contracting Activity in order to carry out special requirements of appropriation acts or other applicable laws relating to particular items.
              (c)(1) The DOE central point of contact for the assignment, correction, or deletion of FEDSTRIP activity address codes is the Office of Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization.
              (e)(4) Materials, supplies, and equipment acquired from Government sources of supply under the procedures described herein must be used exclusively in connection with Government work, except as otherwise authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity.

              Ordering from Government supply sources.
              (b) The Senior Procurement Executive shall be informed of instances in which GSA sources of supply are not used because of the quality of the items available from GSA or when a Federal Supply Schedule contractor refuses to honor an order.

              Responsibilities.
              The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.251-70, Contractor employee travel discounts, in all cost-reimbursable solicitations and contracts when significant costs for rail travel, car rental, or lodging will be required to perform the contract. The contracting officer may furnish the contractor with appropriate identification letters.

              Scope of part.
              This part implements FAR part 52 which sets forth contract clauses for use in connection with the acquisition of personal property and nonpersonal services (including construction), and supplements, as well as modifies, FAR part 52 by prescribing certain modifications to be made to FAR clauses when used in Department of Energy (DOE) contracts and specifying certain Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation clauses to be used in addition to or in place of such FAR clauses.

              It is DOE policy to use the prescribed FAR and DOE contract clauses wherever practicable. Uniformity in the use of contract clauses helps to ensure impartial treatment of all contractors, expedites negotiation and contract review, and facilitates contract administration.

              Security requirements.
              As prescribed in 904.404(d)(1), the following clause shall be included in contracts entered into under section 31 (research assistance, 42 U.S.C. 2051), or section 41 (ownership and operation of production facilities, 42 U.S.C. 2061) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and in other contracts and subcontracts which involve or are likely to involve classified information or special nuclear material:
              
                Security Requirements (AUG 2016)
                (a) Responsibility. It is the Contractor's duty to protect all classified information, special nuclear material, and other DOE property. The Contractor shall, in accordance with DOE security regulations and requirements, be responsible for protecting all classified information and all classified matter (including documents, material and special nuclear material) which are in the Contractor's possession in connection with the performance of work under this contract against sabotage, espionage, loss or theft. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the Contractor shall, upon completion or termination of this contract, transmit to DOE any classified matter or special nuclear material in the possession of the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract. If retention by the Contractor of any classified matter is required after the completion or termination of the contract, the Contractor shall identify the items and classification levels and categories of matter proposed for retention, the reasons for the retention, and the proposed period of retention. If the retention is approved by the Contracting Officer, the security provisions of the contract shall continue to be applicable to the classified matter retained. Special nuclear material shall not be retained after the completion or termination of the contract.
                (b) Regulations. The Contractor agrees to comply with all security regulations and contract requirements of DOE as incorporated into the contract.
                (c) Definition of classified information. The term Classified Information means information that is classified as Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or information determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure under Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, as amended, or prior executive orders, which is identified as National Security Information.
                
                (d) Definition of restricted data. The term Restricted Data means all data concerning design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; production of special nuclear material; or use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but excluding data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2162 [Section 142, as amended, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954].
                (e) Definition of formerly restricted data. The term ”Formerly Restricted Data” means information removed from the Restricted Data category based on a joint determination by DOE or its predecessor agencies and the Department of Defense that the information—(1) Relates primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons; and (2) can be adequately protected as National Security Information. However, such information is subject to the same restrictions on transmission to other countries or regional defense organizations that apply to Restricted Data.
                (f) Definition of national security information. The term “National Security Information” means information that has been determined, pursuant to Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, as amended, or any predecessor order, to require protection against unauthorized disclosure, and that is marked to indicate its classified status when in documentary form.
                (g) Definition of special nuclear material. The term “special nuclear material” means—(1) Plutonium, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, and any other material which, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2071 [section 51 as amended, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954] has been determined to be special nuclear material, but does not include source material; or (2) any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing, but does not include source material.
                (h) Access authorizations of personnel. (1) The Contractor shall not permit any individual to have access to any classified information or special nuclear material, except in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and the DOE's regulations and contract requirements applicable to the particular level and category of classified information or particular category of special nuclear material to which access is required.
                (2) The Contractor must conduct a thorough review, as defined at 48 CFR 904.401, of an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee, and must test the individual for illegal drugs, prior to selecting the individual for a position requiring a DOE access authorization.
                (i) A review must—Verify an uncleared applicant's or uncleared employee's educational background, including any high school diploma obtained within the past five years, and degrees or diplomas granted by an institution of higher learning; contact listed employers for the last three years and listed personal references; conduct local law enforcement checks when such checks are not prohibited by state or local law or regulation and when the uncleared applicant or uncleared employee resides in the jurisdiction where the Contractor is located; and conduct a credit check and other checks as appropriate.
                (ii) Contractor reviews are not required for an applicant for DOE access authorization who possesses a current access authorization from DOE or another Federal agency, or whose access authorization may be reapproved without a federal background investigation pursuant to Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information (August 4, 1995), Sections 3.3(c) and (d).

                (iii) In collecting and using this information to make a determination as to whether it is appropriate to select an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee to a position requiring an access authorization, the Contractor must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those—(A) Governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; and (B) prohibiting discrimination in employment, such as under the ADA, Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, including with respect to pre- and post-offer of employment disability related questioning.

                (iv) In addition to a review, each candidate for a DOE access authorization must be tested to demonstrate the absence of any illegal drug, as defined in 10 CFR 707.4. All positions requiring access authorizations are deemed testing designated positions in accordance with 10 CFR part 707. All employees possessing access authorizations are subject to applicant, random or for cause testing for use of illegal drugs. DOE will not process candidates for a DOE access authorization unless their tests confirm the absence from their system of any illegal drug.
                (v) When an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee receives an offer of employment for a position that requires a DOE access authorization, the Contractor shall not place that individual in such a position prior to the individual's receipt of a DOE access authorization, unless an approval has been obtained from the head of the cognizant local security office. If the individual is hired and placed in the position prior to receiving an access authorization, the uncleared employee may not be afforded access to classified information or matter or special nuclear material (in categories requiring access authorization) until an access authorization has been granted.
                (vi) The Contractor must maintain a record of information concerning each uncleared applicant or uncleared employee who is selected for a position requiring an access authorization. Upon request only, the following information will be furnished to the head of the cognizant local DOE Security Office:
                (A) The date(s) each Review was conducted;
                (B) Each entity that provided information concerning the individual;
                (C) A certification that the review was conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information collected during the review;
                (D) A certification that all information collected during the review was reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the Contractor's personnel policies; and
                (E) The results of the test for illegal drugs.
                (i) Criminal liability. It is understood that disclosure of any classified information relating to the work or services ordered hereunder to any person not entitled to receive it, or failure to protect any classified information, special nuclear material, or other Government property that may come to the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in connection with work under this contract, may subject the Contractor, its agents, employees, or Subcontractors to criminal liability under the laws of the United States (see the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794).
                (j) Foreign ownership, control, or influence. (1) The Contractor shall immediately provide the cognizant security office written notice of any change in the extent and nature of foreign ownership, control or influence over the Contractor which would affect any answer to the questions presented in the Standard Form (SF) 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, executed prior to award of this contract. The Contractor will submit the Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) information in the format directed by DOE. When completed the Contractor must print and sign one copy of the SF 328 and submit it to the Contracting Officer. In addition, any notice of changes in ownership or control which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice, shall also be furnished concurrently to the Contracting Officer.
                (2) If a Contractor has changes involving foreign ownership, control, or influence, DOE must determine whether the changes will pose an undue risk to the common defense and security. In making this determination, DOE will consider proposals made by the Contractor to avoid or mitigate foreign influences.
                (3) If the cognizant security office at any time determines that the Contractor is, or is potentially, subject to foreign ownership, control, or influence, the Contractor shall comply with such instructions as the Contracting Officer shall provide in writing to protect any classified information or special nuclear material.
                (4) The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default either if the Contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this clause or if the Contractor creates a foreign ownership, control, or influence situation in order to avoid performance or a termination for default. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if the Contractor becomes subject to foreign ownership, control, or influence and for reasons other than avoidance of performance of the contract, cannot, or chooses not to, avoid or mitigate the foreign ownership, control, or influence problem.
                (k) Employment announcements. When placing announcements seeking applicants for positions requiring access authorizations, the Contractor shall include in the written vacancy announcement, a notification to prospective applicants that reviews, and tests for the absence of any illegal drug as defined in 10 CFR 707.4, will be conducted by the employer and a background investigation by the Federal government may be required to obtain an access authorization prior to employment, and that subsequent reinvestigations may be required. If the position is covered by the Counterintelligence Evaluation Program regulations at 10 CFR part 709, the announcement should also alert applicants that successful completion of a counterintelligence evaluation may include a counterintelligence-scope polygraph examination.
                (l) Flow down to subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts under its contract that will require subcontractor employees to possess access authorizations. Additionally, the Contractor must require such subcontractors to have an existing DOD or DOE facility clearance or submit a completed SF 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, as required in 48 CFR 952.204-73, Facility Clearance, and obtain a foreign ownership, control and influence determination and facility clearance prior to award of a subcontract. Information to be provided by a subcontractor pursuant to this clause may be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer. For purposes of this clause, subcontractor means any subcontractor at any tier and the term “Contracting Officer” means the DOE Contracting Officer. When this clause is included in a subcontract, the term “Contractor” shall mean subcontractor and the term “contract” shall mean subcontract.

              Classification/Declassification.
              As prescribed in 904.404(d)(2), the following clause shall be included in all contracts which involve classified information:
              
                Classification/Declassification (SEP 1997)
                In the performance of work under this contract, the Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with all provisions of the Department of Energy's regulations and mandatory DOE directives which apply to work involving the classification and declassification of information, documents, or material. In this section, “information” means facts, data, or knowledge itself; “document” means the physical medium on or in which information is recorded; and “material” means a product or substance which contains or reveals information, regardless of its physical form or characteristics. Classified information is “Restricted Data” and “Formerly Restricted Data” (classified under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended) and “National Security Information” (classified under Executive Order 12958 or prior Executive Orders).
                The original decision to classify or declassify information is considered an inherently Governmental function. For this reason, only Government personnel may serve as original classifiers, i.e., Federal Government Original Classifiers. Other personnel (Government or Contractor) may serve as derivative classifiers which involves making classification decisions based upon classification guidance which reflect decisions made by Federal Government Original Classifiers.
                The Contractor or subcontractor shall ensure that any document or material that may contain classified information is reviewed by either a Federal Government or a Contractor Derivative Classifier in accordance with classification regulations including mandatory DOE directives and classification/declassification guidance furnished to the Contractor by the Department of Energy to determine whether it contains classified information prior to dissemination. For information which is not addressed in classification/declassification guidance, but whose sensitivity appears to warrant classification, the Contractor or subcontractor shall ensure that such information is reviewed by a Federal Government Original Classifier.
                In addition, the Contractor or subcontractor shall ensure that existing classified documents (containing either Restricted Data or Formerly Restricted Data or National Security Information) which are in its possession or under its control are periodically reviewed by a Federal Government or Contractor Derivative Declassifier in accordance with classification regulations, mandatory DOE directives and classification/declassification guidance furnished to the Contractor by the Department of Energy to determine if the documents are no longer appropriately classified. Priorities for declassification review of classified documents shall be based on the degree of public and researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification upon review. Documents which no longer contain classified information are to be declassified. Declassified documents then shall be reviewed to determine if they are publicly releasable. Documents which are declassified and determined to be publicly releasable are to be made available to the public in order to maximize the public's access to as much Government information as possible while minimizing security costs.
                The Contractor or subcontractor shall insert this clause in any subcontract which involves or may involve access to classified information.

              In accordance with 904.404(d)(3), the contracting officer shall include the following clause:
              
                Sensitive Foreign Nations Controls (MAR 2011)
                (a) In connection with any activities in the performance of this contract, the Contractor agrees to comply with the “Sensitive Foreign Nations Controls” requirements attached to this contract, relating to those countries, which may from time to time, be identified to the Contractor by written notice as sensitive foreign nations. The Contractor shall have the right to terminate its performance under this contract upon at least 60 days' prior written notice to the Contracting Officer if the Contractor determines that it is unable, without substantially interfering with its polices or without adversely impacting its performance to continue performance of the work under this contract as a result of such notification. If the Contractor elects to terminate performance, the provisions of this contract regarding termination for the convenience of the Government shall apply.
                (b) The provisions of this clause shall be included in any subcontracts which may involve making unclassified information about nuclear technology available to sensitive foreign nations.

                Disclosure of Information (APR 1994)
                (a) It is mutually expected that the activities under this contract will not involve classified information. It is understood, however, that if in the opinion of either party, this expectation changes prior to the expiration or terminating of all activities under this contract, said party shall notify the other party accordingly in writing without delay. In any event, the Contractor shall classify, safeguard, and otherwise act with respect to all classified information in accordance with applicable law and the requirements of DOE, and shall promptly inform DOE in writing if and when classified information becomes involved, or in the mutual judgment of the parties it appears likely that classified information or material may become involved. The Contractor shall have the right to terminate performance of the work under this contract and in such event the provisions of this contract respecting termination for the convenience of the Government shall apply.
                (b) The Contractor shall not permit any individual to have access to classified information except in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act 1954, as amended, Executive Order 12356, and DOE's regulations or requirements.
                (c) The term Restricted Data as used in this article means all data concerning the design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons, the production of special nuclear material or the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but shall not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

              Facility clearance.
              As prescribed in 904.404(d)(5), insert the following provision in all solicitations which require the use of Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, for contracts or subcontracts subject to the provisions of 904.70:
              
                Facility Clearance (AUG 2016)
                Notices

                Section 2536 of title 10, United States Code, prohibits the award of a contract under a national security program to an entity controlled by a foreign government if it is necessary for that entity to be given access to information in a proscribed category of information in order to perform the contract unless a waiver is granted by the Secretary of Energy. In addition, a Facility Clearance and foreign ownership, control and influence (FOCI) information are required when the contract or subcontract to be awarded is expected to require employees to have access authorizations.
                
                Offerors who have either a Department of Defense or a Department of Energy Facility Clearance generally need not resubmit the following foreign ownership information unless specifically requested to do so. Instead, provide your DOE Facility Clearance code or your DOD assigned commercial and government entity (CAGE) code. If uncertain, consult the office which issued this solicitation.
                (a) Use of Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, Standard Form 328. (1) The contract work anticipated by this solicitation will require access to classified information or special nuclear material. Such access will require a Facility Clearance for the Contractor's organization and access authorizations (security clearances) for Contractor personnel working with the classified information or special nuclear material. To obtain a Facility Clearance the Contractor must submit the Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, and all required supporting documents to form a complete Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) Package. The Contractor will submit the Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) information in the format directed by DOE. When completed the Contractor must print and sign one copy of the SF 328 and submit it to the Contracting Officer.
                (2) Information submitted by the offeror in response to the Standard Form 328 will be used solely for the purposes of evaluating foreign ownership, control or influence and will be treated by DOE, to the extent permitted by law, as business or financial information submitted in confidence.
                (3) Following submission of a Standard Form 328 and prior to contract award, the Contractor shall immediately submit to the Contracting Officer written notification of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI which could affect the offeror's answers to the questions in Standard Form 328. Following award of a contract, the Contractor must immediately submit to the cognizant security office written notification of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI which could affect the offeror's answers to the questions in Standard Form 328. Notice of changes in ownership or control which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice must also be furnished concurrently to the cognizant security office.
                (b) Definitions. (1) Foreign Interest means any of the following—
                (i) A foreign government, foreign government agency, or representative of a foreign government;
                (ii) Any form of business enterprise or legal entity organized, chartered or incorporated under the laws of any country other than the United States or its possessions and trust territories; and
                (iii) Any person who is not a citizen or national of the United States.
                (2) Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) means the situation where the degree of ownership, control, or influence over a Contractor by a foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists for concluding that compromise of classified information or special nuclear material may result.
                (c) Facility Clearance means an administrative determination that a facility is eligible to access, produce, use or store classified information, or special nuclear material. A Facility Clearance is based upon a determination that satisfactory safeguards and security measures are carried out for the activities being performed at the facility. It is DOE policy that all Contractors or Subcontractors requiring access authorizations be processed for a Facility Clearance at the level appropriate to the activities being performed under the contract. Approval for a Facility Clearance shall be based upon—
                (1) A favorable foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) determination based upon the Contractor's response to the ten questions in Standard Form 328 and any required, supporting data provided by the Contractor;
                (2) A contract or proposed contract containing the appropriate security clauses;
                (3) Approved safeguards and security plans which describe protective measures appropriate to the activities being performed at the facility;
                (4) An established Reporting Identification Symbol code for the Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards Reporting System if access to nuclear materials is involved;
                (5) A survey conducted no more than 6 months before the Facility Clearance date, with a composite facility rating of satisfactory, if the facility is to possess classified matter or special nuclear material at its location;
                (6) Appointment of a Facility Security Officer, who must possess or be in the process of obtaining an access authorization equivalent to the Facility Clearance; and, if applicable, appointment of a Materials Control and Accountability Representative; and
                (7) Access authorizations for key management personnel who will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and must possess or be in the process of obtaining access authorizations equivalent to the level of the Facility Clearance.

                (d) A Facility Clearance is required prior to the award of a contract requiring access to classified information and the granting of any access authorizations under a contract. Prior to award of a contract, the DOE must determine that award of the contract to the offeror will not pose an undue risk to the common defense and security as a result of its access to classified information or special nuclear material in the performance of the contract. The Contracting Officer may require the offeror to submit such additional information as deemed pertinent to this determination.
                (e) A Facility Clearance is required even for contracts that do not require the Contractor's corporate offices to receive, process, reproduce, store, transmit, or handle classified information or special nuclear material, but which require DOE access authorizations for the Contractor's employees to perform work at a DOE location. This type facility is identified as a non-possessing facility.
                (f) Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the provisions of any resulting contract must require that the Contractor insert provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase orders. Any Subcontractors requiring access authorizations for access to classified information or special nuclear material shall be directed to provide responses to the questions in Standard Form 328, Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests, directly to the prime Contractor or the Contracting Officer for the prime contract.
                Notice to Offerors—Contents Review (Please Review Before Submitting)
                Prior to submitting the Standard Form 328, required by paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, the offeror should review the FOCI submission to ensure that:
                (1) The Standard Form 328 has been signed and dated by an authorized official of the company;
                (2) If publicly owned, the Contractor's most recent annual report, and its most recent proxy statement for its annual meeting of stockholders have been attached; or, if privately owned, the audited, consolidated financial information for the most recently closed accounting year has been attached;
                (3) A copy of the company's articles of incorporation and an attested copy of the company's by-laws, or similar documents filed for the company's existence and management, and all amendments to those documents;
                (4) A list identifying the organization's owners, officers, directors, and executive personnel, including their names, social security numbers, citizenship, titles of all positions they hold within the organization, and what clearances, if any, they possess or are in the process of obtaining, and identification of the government agency(ies) that granted or will be granting those clearances; and
                (5) A summary FOCI data sheet.
              
              
              
                Note:
                A FOCI submission must be attached for each tier parent organization (i.e. ultimate parent and any intervening levels of ownership). If any of these documents are missing, award of the contract cannot be completed.

              As prescribed at 904.404(d)(6), insert the following clause:
              
                Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information (JAN 2004)
                (a) General. (1) The payment of fee or profit (i.e., award fee, fixed fee, and incentive fee or profit) under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information (i.e., Formerly Restricted Data and National Security Information) including compliance with applicable law, regulation, and DOE directives. The term “Contractor” as used in this clause to address failure to comply shall mean “Contractor or Contractor employee.”
                (2) In addition to other remedies available to the Government, if the Contractor fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally reduce the amount of fee or profit that is otherwise payable to the Contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this clause.
                (3) Any reduction in the amount of fee or profit earned by the Contractor will be determined by the severity of the Contractor's failure to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of restricted data or other classified information pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraph (c) of this clause.
                (b) Reduction amount. (1) If in any period (see 48 CFR 952.204-76 (b)(2)) it is found that the Contractor has failed to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information, the Contractor's fee or profit of the period may be reduced. Such reduction shall not be less than 26 percent nor greater than 100 percent of the total fee or profit earned for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11 percent nor greater than 25 percent for a second degree performance failure, and up to 10 percent for a third degree performance failure. The Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the specified range (see 48 CFR 904.402(c)). The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
                (i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.
                (ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance.
                (iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.
                (iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related security areas.
                (2)(i) Except in the case of performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts (see paragraph (b)(3) of this clause), the Contracting Officer, for purposes of this clause, will at the time of contract award, or as soon as practicable thereafter, allocate the total amount of fee or profit that is available under this contract to equal periods of [insert 6 or 12] months to run sequentially for the entire term of the contract (i.e., from the effective date of the contract to the expiration date of the contract, including all options). The amount of fee or profit to be allocated to each period shall be equal to the average monthly fee or profit that is available or otherwise payable during the entire term of the contract, multiplied by the number of months established above for each period.
                (ii) Under this clause, the total amount of fee or profit that is subject to reduction in a period in which a performance failure occurs, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract that provides for a reduction to the fee or profit, shall not exceed the amount of fee or profit that is earned by the Contractor in the period established pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.
                (3) For performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts, the Contracting Officer will at the time of contract award include negative monetary incentives in the contract for Contractor violations relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.
                (c) Safeguarding restricted data and other classified information. Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failures relating to the Contractor's obligations under this contract for safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information are as follows:
                
                (1) First Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered first degree:
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (2) Second Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, serious damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered second degree:
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.
                (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Sceret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Secret.
                (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this clause).
                (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.
                (3) Third Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, undue risk to the common defense and security. In addition, this category includes performance failures that result from a lack of Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future, more severe performance failures and/or conditions, and if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered third degree:
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential.
                (ii) Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information.
                (iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable.
                (iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures which unto themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.

                Printing (APR 1984)
                The Contractor shall not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing (as that term is defined in Title I of the U.S. Government Printing and Binding Regulations in effect on the effective date of this contract) in connection with the performance of work under this contract. Provided, however, that performance of a requirement under this contract involving the duplication of less than 5,000 copies of a single unit, or no more than 25,000 units in the aggregate of multiple units, will not be deemed to be printing. A unit is defined as one sheet, size 81/2 by 11 inches one side only, one color. A requirement is defined as a single publication document.
                (1) The term printing includes the following processes: composition, plate making, presswork, binding, microform publishing, or the end items produced by such processes.
                (2) If fulfillment of the contract will necessitate reproduction in excess of the limits set forth above, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing and obtain the Contracting Officer's approval prior to acquiring on DOE's behalf production, acquisition, and dissemination of printed matter. Such printing must be obtained from the Government Printing Office (GPO), a contract source designated by GPO or a Joint Committee on Printing authorized federal printing plant.
                (3) Printing services not obtained in compliance with this guidance will result in the cost of such printing being disallowed.

                Organizational Conflicts of Interest Disclosure-Advisory and Assistance Services (JUN 1997)
                (a) Organizational conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.
                (b) An offeror notified that it is the apparent successful offeror shall provide the statement described in paragraph (c) of this provision. For purposes of this provision, “apparent successful offeror” means the proposer selected for final negotiations or, where individual contracts are negotiated with all firms in the competitive range, it means all such firms.
                (c) The statement must contain the following:
                (1) A statement of any past (within the past twelve months), present, or currently planned financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests relating to the performance of the statement of work. For contractual interests, such statement must include the name, address, telephone number of the client or client(s), a description of the services rendered to the previous client(s), and the name of a responsible officer or employee of the offeror who is knowledgeable about the services rendered to each client, if, in the 12 months preceding the date of the statement, services were rendered to the Government or any other client (including a foreign government or person) respecting the same subject matter of the instant solicitation, or directly relating to such subject matter. The agency and contract number under which the services were rendered must also be included, if applicable. For financial interests, the statement must include the nature and extent of the interest and any entity or entities involved in the financial relationship. For these and any other interests enough such information must be provided to allow a meaningful evaluation of the potential effect of the interest on the performance of the statement of work.
                (2) A statement that no actual or potential conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage exists with respect to the advisory and assistance services to be provided in connection with the instant contract or that any actual or potential conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage that does or may exist with respect to the contract in question has been communicated as part of the statement required by (b) of this provision.
                (d) Failure of the offeror to provide the required statement may result in the offeror being determined ineligible for award. Misrepresentation or failure to report any fact may result in the assessment of penalties associated with false statements or such other provisions provided for by law or regulation.

                Organizational Conflicts of Interest (AUG 2009)
                (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the Contractor (1) is not biased because of its financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.
                (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Contractor and any of its affiliates or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Contractor”) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime Contractor, subcontractor, cosponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.
                (1) Use of contractor's work product. (i) The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in any capacity in Department contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefore (solicited and unsolicited) which stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this contract for a period of (Contracting Officer see 48 CFR 909.507-2 and enter specific term) years after the completion of this contract. Furthermore, unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not perform any advisory and assistance services work under this contract on any of its products or services or the products or services of another firm if the Contractor is or has been substantially involved in their development or marketing. Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the Contractor from competing for follow-on contracts for advisory and assistance services.
                (ii) If, under this contract, the Contractor prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications to be used in competitive acquisitions, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort which is based on such statement of work or specifications. The Contractor shall not incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, in which case the restriction in this subparagraph shall not apply.
                (iii) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Contractor from offering or selling its standard and commercial items to the Government.
                (2) Access to and use of information. (i) If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to information, such as Department plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or data which has not been released or otherwise made available to the public, the Contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer it shall not—
                (A) Use such information for any private purpose unless the information has been released or otherwise made available to the public;
                (B) Compete for work for the Department based on such information for a period of six (6) months after either the completion of this contract or until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public, whichever is first;
                (C) Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government which is based on such information until one year after such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; and
                (D) Release such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise made available to the public by the Department.
                (ii) In addition, the Contractor agrees that to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, it shall treat such information in accordance with any restrictions imposed on such information.
                (iii) The Contractor may use technical data it first produces under this contract for its private purposes consistent with paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) and (D) of this clause and the patent, rights in data, and security provisions of this contract.
                (c) Disclosure after award. (1) The Contractor agrees that, if changes, including additions, to the facts disclosed by it prior to award of this contract, occur during the performance of this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure of such changes in writing to the Contracting Officer. Such disclosure may include a description of any action which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. The Department may, however, terminate the contract for convenience if it deems such termination to be in the best interest of the Government.
                (2) In the event that the Contractor was aware of facts required to be disclosed or the existence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and did not disclose such facts or such conflict of interest to the Contracting Officer, DOE may terminate this contract for default.
                (d) Remedies. For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any facts required to be disclosed concerning this contract, including the existence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest at the time of or after award, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify the Contractor from subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
                (e) Waiver. Requests for waiver under this clause shall be directed in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a full description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. If it is determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the Contracting Officer may grant such a waiver in writing.
              
              (End of clause)
              
              
                Alternate I: In accordance with 909.507-2 and 970.0905, include the following alternate in the specified types of contracts.
              
              
                (f) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor shall include a clause, substantially similar to this clause, including this paragraph (f), in subcontracts expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold determined in accordance with 48 CFR part 13 and involving the performance of advisory and assistance services as that term is defined at 48 CFR 2.101. The terms “contract,” “Contractor,” and “contracting officer” shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
                
                (2) Prior to the award under this contract of any such subcontracts for advisory and assistance services, the Contractor shall obtain from the proposed subcontractor or consultant the disclosure required by 48 CFR 909.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual or significant potential for an organizational conflict of interest. Where an actual or significant potential organizational conflict of interest is identified, the Contractor shall take actions to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the organizational conflict to the satisfaction of the Contractor. If the conflict cannot be avoided or neutralized, the Contractor must obtain the approval of the DOE Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Contractor deems immediate removal or suspension of any member of its management team is necessary to fulfill its obligation to maintain satisfactory standards of employee competency, conduct, and integrity under the clause at 48 CFR 970.5203-3, Contractor's Organization, the Contractor may remove or suspend such person at once, although the Contractor must notify Contracting Officer prior to or concurrently with such action.

                (b) The list of personnel may, with the consent of the contracting parties, be amended from time to time during the course of the contract to add or delete personnel.

              As prescribed at 923.7003(f), insert the following clause:
              
                Conditional Payment of Fee or Profit—Safeguarding Restricted Data and Other Classified Information and Protection of Worker Safety and Health (DEC 2010)
                (a) General. (1) The payment of fee or profit (i.e., award fee, fixed fee, and incentive fee or profit) under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information (i.e., Formerly Restricted Data and National Security Information) and relating to the protection of worker safety and health, including compliance with applicable law, regulation, and DOE directives. The term “contractor” as used in this clause to address failure to comply shall mean “contractor or contractor employee.”
                
                (2) In addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, if the Contractor fails to comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information or relating to the protection of worker safety and health, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally reduce the amount of fee or profit that is otherwise payable to the Contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this clause.
                (3) Any reduction in the amount of fee or profit earned by the Contractor will be determined by the severity of the Contractor's failure to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information or relating to worker safety and health pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause.
                (b) Reduction amount. (1) If in any period (see paragraph (b)(2) of this clause) it is found that the Contractor has failed to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information or relating to the protection of worker safety and health, the Contractor's fee or profit of the period may be reduced. Such reduction shall not be less than 26 percent nor greater than 100 percent of the total fee or profit earned for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11 percent nor greater than 25 percent for a second degree performance failure, and up to 10 percent for a third degree performance failure. The Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the specified range (see 48 CFR 904.402(c) and 48 CFR 923.7002(a)(2)). The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following ((v), (vi), (vii), and (viii) apply to worker safety and health (WS&H) only :
                (i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.
                (ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance.
                (iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.
                (iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of: Safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related security areas; or of protecting WS&H and compliance in related areas.
                (v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial WS&H standards are routinely practiced (e.g., Voluntary Protection Program Star Status).
                (vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor (e.g., offsite emergency response).
                (vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain WS&H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making (e.g., policy, WS&H programs).
                (viii) Contractor demonstration that an Operating Experience and Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in WS&H by use of lessons-learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.
                (2)(i) Except in the case of performance-based, firm-fixed-price contracts (see paragraph (b)(3) of this clause), the Contracting Officer, for purposes of this clause, will at the time of contract award, or as soon as practicable thereafter, allocate the total amount of fee or profit that is available under this contract to equal periods of [insert 6 or 12] months to run sequentially for the entire term of the contract (i.e., from the effective date of the contract to the expiration date of the contract, including all options). The amount of fee or profit to be allocated to each period shall be equal to the average monthly fee or profit that is available or otherwise payable during the entire term of the contract, multiplied by the number of months established above for each period.
                (ii) Under this clause, the total amount of fee or profit that is subject to reduction in a period in which a performance failure occurs, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract that provides for a reduction to the fee or profit, shall not exceed the amount of fee or profit that is earned by the Contractor in the period established pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.
                (3) For performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts, the Contracting Officer will at the time of contract award include negative monetary incentives in the contract for Contractor violations relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information and relating to protection of worker safety and health.
                (c) Safeguarding restricted data and other classified information. Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failures relating to the Contractor's obligations under this contract for safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information are as follows:
                (1) First Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered first degree:
                
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other classified information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (2) Second Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, serious damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered second degree:
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.
                (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Secret.
                (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other classified information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this clause).
                (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.
                (3) Third Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, undue risk to the common defense and security. In addition, this category includes performance failures that result from a lack of contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future, more severe performance failures and/or conditions, and if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential.
                (ii) Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information.
                (iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable.
                (iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures which unto themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.
                (d) Protection of worker safety and health. Performance failures occur if the contractor does not comply with the contract's WS&H terms and conditions, which may be included in the DOE approved contractor Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS). The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of fee or profit will be determined are:
                (1) First Degree: Performance failures that are most adverse to WS&H or could threaten the successful completion of a program or project. For contracts including ISMS requirements, failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of WS&H aspects of an ISMS is considered first degree. The Government will perform necessary review of the ISMS in a timely manner and will not unreasonably withhold approval of the WS&H aspects of the Contractor's ISMS. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be deemed first degree:
                (i) Type A accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1A, Accident Investigations, or its successor).
                (ii) Two Second Degree performance failures during an evaluation period.
                (2) Second Degree: Performance failures that are significantly adverse to WS&H. They include failures to comply with approved WS&H aspects of an ISMS that result in an actual injury, exposure, or exceedence that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree:
                (i) Type B accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1A, Accident Investigations, or its successor).
                (ii) Non-compliance with approved WS&H aspects of an ISMS that results in a near miss of a Type A or B accident. A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, but does not result in an adverse effect.
                (iii) Failure to mitigate or notify DOE of an imminent danger situation after discovery, where such notification is a requirement of the contract.
                (3) Third Degree: Performance failures that reflect a lack of focus on improving WS&H. They include failures to comply with approved WS&H aspects of an ISMS that result in potential breakdown of the Contractor's WS&H system. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:

                (i) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliance documented through external (e.g., Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Manual 231.1-2, Occurrence Reporting and Processing of Operations Information, or its successor, requirements, or internal oversight of DOE Order 470.2B, Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance Program, or its successor, requirements.
                (ii) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g., Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant WS&H system breakdown.
                (iii) Non-compliances that either have, or may have, significant negative impacts to workers that indicate a significant WS&H system breakdown.
                (iv) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract.

                (3) Any reduction in the amount of fee or profit earned by the Contractor will be determined by the severity of the Contractor's failure to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to worker safety and health pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraph (c) of this clause.
                (b) Reduction amount. (1) If in any period (see paragraph (b)(2) of this clause) it is found that the Contractor has failed to comply with contract terms and conditions relating to the protection of worker safety and health, the Contractor's fee or profit of the period may be reduced. Such reduction shall not be less than 26% nor greater than 100% of the total fee or profit earned for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11% nor greater than 25% for a second degree performance failure, and up to 10% for a third degree performance failure.

                (ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance.
                
                (iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.
                (iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of protecting WS&H and compliance in related areas.
                (v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial WS&H standards are routinely practiced (e.g., Voluntary Protection Program Star Status).
                (vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor (e.g., offsite emergency response).
                (vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain WS&H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making (e.g., policy, WS&H programs).
                (viii) Contractor demonstration that an Operating Experience and Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in WS&H by use of lessons-learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.
                (2)(i) Except in the case of performance based firm-fixed-price contracts (see paragraph (b)(3) below), the Contracting Officer, for purposes of this clause, will at the time of contract award, or as soon as practicable thereafter, allocate the total amount of fee or profit that is available under this contract to equal periods of [insert 6 or 12] months to run sequentially for the entire term of the contract (i.e., from the effective date of the contract to the expiration date of the contract, including all options). The amount of fee or profit to be allocated to each period shall be equal to the average monthly fee or profit that is available or otherwise payable during the entire term of the contract, multiplied by the number of months established above for each period.
                (ii) Under this clause, the total amount of fee or profit that is subject to reduction in a period in which a performance failure occurs, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract that provides for a reduction to the fee or profit, shall not exceed the amount of fee or profit that is earned by the Contractor in the period established pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.
                (3) For performance-based firm-fixed-price contracts, the Contracting Officer will at the time of contract award include negative monetary incentives in the contract for contractor violations relating to the protection of worker safety and health.
                (c) Protection of worker safety and health. Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's WS&H terms and conditions, which may be included in the DOE approved contractor Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS). The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of fee or profit will be determined are:
                (1) First Degree: Performance failures that are most adverse to WS&H or could threaten the successful completion of a program or project. For contracts including ISMS requirements, failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of WS&H aspects of an ISMS is considered first degree. The Government will perform necessary review of the ISMS in a timely manner and will not unreasonably withhold approval of the WS&H aspects of the Contractor's ISMS. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be deemed first degree:
                (i) Type A accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1A, Accident Investigations, or its successor).
                (ii) Two Second Degree performance failures during an evaluation period.
                (2) Second Degree: Performance failures that are significantly adverse to WS&H. They include failures to comply with approved WS&H aspects of an ISMS that result in an actual injury, exposure, or exceedence that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree:
                (i) Type B accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1A, Accident Investigations, or its successor).
                (ii) Non-compliance with approved WS&H aspects of an ISMS that results in a near miss of a Type A or B accident. A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, but does not result in an adverse effect.
                (iii) Failure to mitigate or notify DOE of an imminent danger situation after discovery, where such notification is a requirement of the contract.
                (3) Third Degree: Performance failures that reflect a lack of focus on improving WS&H. They include failures to comply with approved WS&H aspects of an ISMS that result in potential breakdown of the Contractor's WS&H system. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:

                (i) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliance documented through external (e.g., Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Manual 231.1-2, Occurrence Reporting and Processing of Operations Information, or its successor, requirements, or internal oversight of DOE Order 470.2B, Independent Oversight and Performance Assurance Program, or its successor, requirements.

                (ii) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g., Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant WS&H system breakdown.
                
                (iii) Non-compliances that either have, or may have, significant negative impacts to workers that indicate a significant WS&H system breakdown.
                (iv) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract.

This requirement should not be flowed down to subcontractors.
                (f) In complying with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor(s) shall coordinate its activities with and submit required reports through the Environmental Sustainability Coordinator or equivalent position. Reporting under this paragraph and paragraphs (g) and (h) of this clause is only required if the contract or subcontract offers subcontracting opportunities for energy efficient and environmentally sustainable products or services exceeding $100,000 in any contract year.
                (g) The Contractor shall prepare and submit performance reports, if required, using prescribed DOE formats, at the end of the Federal fiscal year, on matters related to the acquisition of environmentally preferable and sustainable products and services. This is a material delivery under the contract. Failure to perform this requirement may be considered a failure that endangers performance of this contract and may result in termination for default.
                (h) These provisions shall be flowed down only to first tier subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that support operation of the DOE facility and offer significant subcontracting opportunities for energy efficient or environmentally sustainable products or services. The Subcontractor, if subcontracting opportunities for sustainable and environmentally preferable products or services exceed the threshold in paragraph (f) of this clause, will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this clause regarding the collection of all data necessary to generate the reports required under paragraphs (c) through (f) of this clause, and submit the reports directly to the Prime Contractor's Environmental Sustainability Coordinator at the supported facility. The Subcontractor will advise the Contractor if it is unable to procure energy efficient and environmentally sustainable items and cite which of the reasons in paragraph (c) of this clause apply. The reports may be submitted at the conclusion of the subcontract term provided that the subcontract delivery term is not multi-year in nature. If the delivery term is multi-year, the Subcontractor shall report its accomplishments for each Federal fiscal year in a manner and at a time or times acceptable to both parties. Failure to comply with these reporting requirements may be considered a breach of contract with attendant consequences.
                (i) When this clause is used in a subcontract, the word “Contractor” will be understood to mean “Subcontractor.”

              Subcontracting for nuclear hot cell services.
              As prescribed in 925.7004, insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts:
              
                Subcontracting for Nuclear Hot Cell Services (MAR 1993)
                (a) Definitions. Costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities, as used in this clause, means any cost associated with the compliance with regulatory requirements governing the decommissioning of nuclear facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Such costs for foreign facilities and for Department of Energy facilities are costs of decommissioning associated with the compliance with foreign regulatory requirements or the Department's own requirements.
                
                  Costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste, as used in this clause, means any costs, whether required by regulation or incurred as a matter of prudent business practice, associated with the storage or disposal of nuclear waste.
                
                  Foreign company, as used in this clause, means a company which offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility which is not subject to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, and its political subdivisions.
                
                  Nuclear hot cell services, as used in this clause, means services related to the examination of, or performance of various operations on, nuclear fuel rods, control assemblies, or other components that are emitting large quantities of ionizing radiation, after discharge from nuclear reactors, which are performed in specialized facilities located away from commercial nuclear power plants, generally referred to in the industry as “hot cells.”
                
                  Nuclear waste, as used in this clause, means any radioactive waste material subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the Department of Energy, or in the case of foreign offers, by comparable foreign organizations.
                
                  United States company, as used in this clause, means a company which offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility subject to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, and its political subdivisions.
                (b) In selecting a competitive offer for a first-tier subcontract acquisition of nuclear hot cell services, the Contractor shall—
                (1) Consider neither costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear waste facilities nor costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste; or
                (2) Add these costs to offers of foreign companies, if—
                (i) One or more of the offers is submitted by a United States company and includes costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste because it is subject to such cost; and

                (ii) One or more of the offers is submitted by a foreign company and does not include these types of costs. (A foreign company might not be subject to such costs or might not have to include these types of cost in its offer if the firm is subsidized in decommissioning activity or storage and disposal of nuclear waste, or a foreign government is performing the activities below the actual cost of the activity.)
                (c) Upon determining that no offer from a foreign firm has a reasonable chance of being selected for award, the requirements of this clause will not apply.

              Compliance with export control laws and regulations (Export Clause)
              As prescribed in 925.7102, use the following clause:
              
                Compliance With Export Control Laws and Regulations (NOV 2015)
                (a) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations.
                (b) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.
                (c) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds to, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations, including but not limited to—
                (1) The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), as amended;
                (2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.);

                (3) The Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. app. 2401 et seq.), as continued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (Title II of Pub. L. 95-223, 91 Stat. 1626, October 28, 1977; 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.);
                (4) Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 5(b), as amended by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961);
                (5) Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities (10 CFR part 810);
                (6) Export and Import of Nuclear Equipment and Material (10 CFR part 110);
                (7) International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130);
                (8) Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730 through 774); and
                (9) The regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury (31 CFR parts 500 through 598).
                (d) In addition to the Federal laws and regulations cited above, National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189, National Policy on the Transfer of Scientific, Technical, and Engineering Information, establishes a national policy that, to the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental research shall remain unrestricted. NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research generally do not involve any export-controlled activities.

                NSDD 189 does not take precedence over statutes. NSDD 189 does not exempt any research from statutes that apply to export controls such as the Atomic Energy Act, as amended; the Arms Export Control Act; the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended; or the U.S. International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or regulations that implement parts of those statutes (e.g., the ITAR, the EAR, 10 CFR part 110 and 10 CFR part 810). Thus, if items (e.g., commodities, software or technologies) that are controlled by U.S. export control laws or regulations are used to conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts, export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.
                (e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all solicitations and subcontracts.

                Refund of Royalties (MAR 1995)
                (a) The contract price includes certain amounts for royalties payable by the Contractor or subcontractors or both, which amounts have been reported to the Contracting Officer.
                (b) The term royalties as used in this clause refers to any costs or charges in the nature of royalties, license fees, patent or license amortization costs, or the like, for the use of or for rights in patents and patent applications in connection with performing this contract or any subcontract here-under. The term also includes any costs or charges associated with the access to, use of, or other right pertaining to data that is represented to be proprietary and is related to the performance of this contract or the copying of such data or data that is copyrighted.

                (d) The Contractor will be compensated for royalties reported under paragraph (c) of this clause, only to the extent that such royalties were included in the contract price and are determined by the Contracting Officer to be properly chargeable to the Government and allocable to the contract. To the extent that any royalties that are included in the contract price are not, in fact, paid by the Contractor or are determined by the Contracting Officer not to be properly chargeable to the government and allocable to the contract, the contract price shall be reduced. Repayment or credit to the Government shall be made as the Contracting Officer directs. The approval by DOE of any individual payments or royalties shall not prevent the Government from contesting at any time the enforceability, validity, scope of, or title to, any patent or the proprietary nature of data pursuant to which a royalty or other payment is to be or has been made.
                (e) If, at any time within 3 years after final payment under this contract, the Contractor for any reason is relieved in whole or in part from the payment of the royalties included in the final contract price as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of that fact and shall reimburse the Government in a corresponding amount.
                (f) The substance of this clause, including this paragraph (f), shall be included in any subcontract in which the amount of royalties reported during negotiation of the subcontract exceeds $250.

              As prescribed in 927.303(a), insert the following clause:
              
                Patent Rights—Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (MAR 1995)
                (a) Definitions—(1) Invention means any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the United States Code, or any novel variety of plant which is or may be protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.).
                (2) Made when used in relation to any invention means the conception of first actual reduction to practice of such invention.
                (3) Nonprofit organization means a university or other institution of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization statute.
                (4) Practical application means to manufacture, in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.
                (5) Small business firm means a small business concern as defined at section 2 of Public Law 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For the purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business concerns involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.
                (6) Subject invention means any invention of the contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under this contract, provided that in the case of a variety of plant, the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during the period of contract performance.
                (7) Agency licensing regulations and agency regulations concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions mean the Department of Energy patent licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781.
                
                (b) Allocation of principal rights. The Contractor may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the Contractor retains title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world.
                (c) Invention disclosure, election of title, and filing of patent application by Contractor. (1) The Contractor will disclose each subject invention to the Department of Energy (DOE) within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the DOE, the Contractor will promptly notify that agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor.
                (2) The Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying DOE within 2 years of disclosure to DOE. However, in any case where publication, on sale or public use has initiated the l-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by DOE to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.
                (3) The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within 1 year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either 10 months of the corresponding initial patent application or 6 months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
                (4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure, election, and filing under subparagraphs (c)(l), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of the agency, be granted.
                (d) Conditions when the Government may obtain title. The Contractor will convey to the Federal agency, upon written request, title to any subject invention—
                (1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain title; provided, that DOE may only request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the Contractor to disclose or elect within the specified times.
                (2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the Federal agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country.
                (3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.
                (e) Minimum rights to Contractor and protection of the Contractor right to file. (1) The Contractor will retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiary and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the Federal agency, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.

                (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
                (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and agency regulations concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.
                (f) Contractor action to protect the Government's interest. (1) The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to DOE all instruments necessary to (i) establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title, and (ii) convey title to DOE when requested under paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.
                (2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
                (3) The Contractor will notify DOE of any decision not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.
                (4) The Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.”
                (g) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor will include this clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the Contractor in this clause, and the Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
                (2) The contractor shall include in all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work the patent rights clause at 952.227-13.
                (3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, DOE, subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.
                (h) Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received, by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by that agency in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.
                (i) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
                (j) March-in rights. The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the agency to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that—
                (1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;
                (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees;
                (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
                (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
                (k) Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations. If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that—
                (1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of the Federal agency, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;
                (2) The Contractor will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when DOE deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
                (3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and
                (4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this subparagraph (k)(4).
                (l) Communications. (1) The contractor shall direct any notification, disclosure, or request to DOE provided for in this clause to the DOE patent counsel assisting the DOE contracting activity, with a copy of the communication to the Contracting Officer.
                (2) Each exercise of discretion or decision provided for in this clause, except subparagraph (k)(4), is reserved for the DOE Patent Counsel and is not a claim or dispute and is not subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.
                (3) Upon request of the DOE Patent Counsel or the contracting officer, the contractor shall provide any or all of the following:
                (i) A copy of the patent application, filing date, serial number and title, patent number, and issue date for any subject invention in any country in which the contractor has applied for a patent;
                (ii) A report, not more often than annually, summarizing all subject inventions which were disclosed to DOE individually during the reporting period specified; or
                (iii) A report, prior to closeout of the contract, listing all subject inventions or stating that there were none.

              952.227-13
              Patent rights—acquisition by the Government.
              As prescribed at 927.303(a)(1), insert the following clause:
              
                
                Patent Rights—Acquisition by the Government (SEP 1997)
                (a) Definitions.
                
                
                  Invention, as used in this clause, means any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the United States Code or any novel variety of plant that is or may be protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.).
                
                  Practical application, as used in this clause, means to manufacture, in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.
                
                  Subject invention, as used in this clause, means any invention of the Contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract.
                
                  Patent Counsel, as used in this clause, means the Department of Energy Patent Counsel assisting the procuring activity.
                
                  DOE patent waiver regulations, as used in this clause, means the Department of Energy patent waiver regulations in effect on the date of award of this contract. See 10 CFR part 784.
                
                  Agency licensing regulations and applicable agency licensing regulations, as used in this clause, mean the Department of Energy patent licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781.
                (b) Allocations of principal rights—(1) Assignment to the Government. The Contractor agrees to assign to the Government the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world in and to each subject invention, except to the extent that rights are retained by the Contractor under subparagraph (b)(2) and paragraph (d) of this clause.
                (2) Greater rights determinations. (i) The Contractor, or an employee-inventor after consultation with the Contractor, may request greater rights than the nonexclusive license and the foreign patent rights provided in paragraph (d) of this clause on identified inventions in accordance with the DOE patent waiver regulations. A request for a determination of whether the Contractor or the employee-inventor is entitled to acquire such greater rights must be submitted to the Patent Counsel with a copy to the Contracting Officer at the time of the first disclosure of the invention pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, or not later than 8 months thereafter, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. Each determination of greater rights under this contract shall be subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, unless otherwise provided in the greater rights determination, and to the reservations and conditions deemed to be appropriate by the Secretary of Energy or designee.
                (ii) Within two (2) months after the filing of a patent application, the Contractor shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and, promptly upon issuance of a patent, provide the patent number and issue date for any subject invention in any country for which the Contractor has been granted title or the right to file and prosecute on behalf of the United States by the Department of Energy.
                (iii) Not less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the response period for any action required by the Patent and Trademark Office, notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to continue prosecution of the application.
                (iv) Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application file.
                (c) Minimum rights acquired by the Government. (1) With respect to each subject invention to which the Department of Energy grants the Contractor principal or exclusive rights, the Contractor agrees as follows:
                (i) The Contractor hereby grants to the Government a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced each subject invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the Government of the United States (including any Government agency).
                (ii) The Contractor agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which DOE has granted it title, DOE has the right in accordance with the procedures in the DOE patent waiver regulations (10 CFR part 784) to require the Contractor, an assignee, or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if it determines that—
                (A) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;
                (B) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees;

                (C) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
                
                (D) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has neither been obtained nor waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
                (iii) The Contractor agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by that agency in accordance with subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause. To the extent data or information supplied under this section is considered by the Contractor, its licensee, or assignee to be privileged and confidential and is so marked, the Department of Energy agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government.
                (iv) The Contractor agrees, when licensing a subject invention, to arrange to avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government funds, including funds derived through a Military Assistance Program of the Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund any amounts received as royalty charges on a subject invention in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for such refund in any instrument transferring rights in the invention to any party.
                (v) The Contractor agrees to provide for the Government's paid-up license pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause in any instrument transferring rights in a subject invention and to provide for the granting of licenses as required by subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause, and for the reporting of utilization information as required by subparagraph (c)(1)(iii) of this clause, whenever the instrument transfers principal or exclusive rights in a subject invention.
                (2) Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall be deemed to grant to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a subject invention.
                (d) Minimum rights to the Contractor. (1) The Contractor is hereby granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on a subject invention and any resulting patent in which the Government obtains title, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
                (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions in 37 CFR part 404 and agency licensing regulations. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical applications and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
                (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable agency licensing regulations and 37 CFR part 404 concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.
                (4) The Contractor may request the right to acquire patent rights to a subject invention in any foreign country where the Government has elected not to secure such rights, subject to the conditions in subparagraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(vii) of this clause. Such request must be made in writing to the Patent Counsel as part of the disclosure required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, with a copy to the DOE Contracting Officer. DOE approval, if given, will be based on a determination that this would best serve the national interest.
                (i) The recipient of such rights, when specifically requested by DOE, and three years after issuance of a foreign patent disclosing the subject invention, shall furnish DOE a report stating:

                (A) The commercial use that is being made, or is intended to be made, of said invention, and
                
                (B) The steps taken to bring the invention to the point of practical application or to make the invention available for licensing.
                (ii) The Government shall retain at least an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license to make, use, and sell the invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the Government (including any Government agency) and States and domestic municipal governments, unless the Secretary of Energy or designee determines that it would not be in the public interest to acquire the license for the States and domestic municipal governments.
                (iii) If noted elsewhere in this contract as a condition of the grant of an advance waiver of the Government's title to inventions under this contract, or, if no advance waiver was granted but a waiver of the Government's title to an identified invention is granted pursuant to subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause upon a determination by the Secretary of Energy that it is in the Government's best interest, this license shall include the right of the Government to sublicense foreign governments pursuant to any existing or future treaty or agreement with such foreign governments.
                (iv) Subject to the rights granted in subparagraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause, the Secretary of Energy or designee shall have the right to terminate the foreign patent rights granted in this subparagraph (d)(4) in whole or in part unless the recipient of such rights demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee that effective steps necessary to accomplish substantial utilization of the invention have been taken or within a reasonable time will be taken.
                (v) Subject to the rights granted in subparagraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause, the Secretary of Energy or designee shall have the right, commencing four years after foreign patent rights are accorded under this subparagraph (d)(4), to require the granting of a nonexclusive or partially exclusive license to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms reasonable under the circumstances, and in appropriate circumstances to terminate said foreign patent rights in whole or in part, following a hearing upon notice thereof to the public, upon a petition by an interested person justifying such hearing:
                (A) If the Secretary of Energy or designee determines, upon review of such material as he deems relevant, and after the recipient of such rights or other interested person has had the opportunity to provide such relevant and material information as the Secretary or designee may require, that such foreign patent rights have tended substantially to lessen competition or to result in undue market concentration in any section of the United States in any line of commerce to which the technology relates; or
                (B) Unless the recipient of such rights demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee at such hearing that the recipient has taken effective steps, or within a reasonable time thereafter is expected to take such steps, necessary to accomplish substantial utilization of the invention.
                (vi) If the contractor is to file a foreign patent application on a subject invention, the Government agrees, upon written request, to use its best efforts to withhold publication of such invention disclosures for such period of time as specified by Patent Counsel, but in no event shall the Government or its employees be liable for any publication thereof.
                (vii) Subject to the license specified in subparagraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this clause, the contractor or inventor agrees to convey to the Government, upon request, the entire right, title, and interest in any foreign country in which the contractor or inventor fails to have a patent application filed in a timely manner or decides not to continue prosecution or to pay any maintenance fees covering the invention. To avoid forfeiture of the patent application or patent, the contractor or inventor shall, not less than 60 days before the expiration period for any action required by any patent office, notify the Patent Counsel of such failure or decision, and deliver to the Patent Counsel, the executed instruments necessary for the conveyance specified in this paragraph.
                (e) Invention identification, disclosures, and reports. (1) The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to assure that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters within 6 months of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work under this contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of subject inventions, and records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing the inventions are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.

                (2) The Contractor shall disclose each subject invention to the DOE Patent Counsel with a copy to the Contracting Officer within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters or, if earlier, within 6 months after the Contractor becomes aware that a subject invention has been made, but in any event before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale, or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to DOE, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor. The report should also include any request for a greater rights determination in accordance with subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause. When an invention is disclosed to DOE under this paragraph, it shall be deemed to have been made in the manner specified in Sections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 42 U.S.C. 5908, unless the Contractor contends in writing at the time the invention is disclosed that is was not so made.
                (3) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the following:
                (i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, listing all subject inventions during that period, and including a statment that all subject inventions have been disclosed (or that there are not such inventions), and that such disclosure has been made in accordance with the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause.
                (ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work listing all subject inventions or containing a statement that there were no such inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent right clause or containing a statement that there were no such subcontracts.
                (4) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause.
                (5) The Contractor agrees, subject to FAR 27.302(j), that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.
                (f) Examination of records relating to inventions. (1) The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether—
                (i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
                (ii) The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures required by subparagraphs (e) (1) and (4) of this clause;
                (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.
                (2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention which the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to DOE for a determination of ownership rights.
                (3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.
                (g) Withholding of payment (This paragraph does not apply to subcontracts).
                (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to—
                (i) Convey to the Government, using a DOE-approved form, the title and/or rights of the Government in each subject invention as required by this clause.
                (ii) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause;
                (iii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause;
                (iv) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to subparagraph (e)(3)(i) of this clause; or
                (v) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to subparagraph (h)(4) of this clause.

                (2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.
                
                (3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of subject inventions required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, and acceptable final report pursuant to subparagraph (e)(3)(ii) of this clause, and the Patent Counsel has issued a patent clearance certification to the Contracting Officer.
                (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.
                (h) Subcontracts. (1) The contractor shall include the clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11 (suitably modified to identify the parties) in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except where the work of the subcontract is subject to an Exceptional Circumstances Determination by DOE. In all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or research work, the contractor shall include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties). The contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
                (2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept such a clause the Contractor—
                (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and
                (ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.
                (3) In the case of subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by this clause.
                (4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.
                (5) The contractor shall identify all subject inventions of the subcontractor of which it acquires knowledge in the performance of this contract and shall notify the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the contracting officer, promptly upon identification of the inventions.
                (i) Preference United States industry. Unless provided otherwise, no Contractor that receives title to any subject invention and no assignee of any such Contractor shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the Government upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
                (j) Atomic energy. (1) No claim for pecuniary award of compensation under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, shall be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived in the course of or under this contract.
                (2) Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor will obtain patent agreements to effectuate the provisions of subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause from all persons who perform any part of the work under this contract, except nontechnical personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers.
                (k) Background patents. (1) Background patent means a domestic patent covering an invention or discovery which is not a subject invention and which is owned or controlled by the Contractor at any time through the completion of this contract:
                (i) Which the contractor, but not the Government, has the right to license to others without obligation to pay royalties thereon, and
                (ii) Infringement of which cannot reasonably be avoided upon the practice of any specific process, method, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter (including relatively minor modifications thereof) which is a subject of the research, development, or demonstration work performed under this contract.

                (2) The Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government a royalty-free, nonexclusive license under any background patent for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract by or for the Government in research, development, and demonstration work only.
                
                (3) The Contractor also agrees that upon written application by DOE, it will grant to responsible parties, for purposes of practicing a subject of this contract, nonexclusive licenses under any background patent on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If, however, the Contractor believes that exclusive rights are necessary to achieve expeditious commercial development or utilization, then a request may be made to DOE for DOE approval of such licensing by the Contractor.
                (4) Notwithstanding subparagraph (k)(3) of this clause, the contractor shall not be obligated to license any background patent if the Contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee that:
                (i) A competitive alternative to the subject matter covered by said background patent is commercially available or readily introducible from one or more other sources; or
                (ii) The Contractor or its licensees are supplying the subject matter covered by said background patent in sufficient quantity and at reasonable prices to satisfy market needs, or have taken effective steps or within a reasonable time are expected to take effective steps to so supply the subject matter.
                (l) Publication. It is recognized that during the course of the work under this contract, the Contractor or its employees may from time to time desire to release or publish information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract. In order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interests of DOE or the Contractor, patent approval for release of publication shall be secured from Patent Counsel prior to any such release or publication.
                (m) Forfeiture of rights in unreported subject inventions. (1) The Contractor shall forfeit and assign to the Government, at the request of the Secretary of Energy or designee, all rights in any subject invention which the Contractor fails to report to Patent Counsel within six months after the time the Contractor:
                (i) Files or causes to be filed a United States or foreign patent application thereon; or
                (ii) Submits the final report required by subparagraph (e)(2)(ii) of this clause, whichever is later.
                (2) However, the Contractor shall not forfeit rights in a subject invention if, within the time specified in subparagraph (m)(1) of this clause, the Contractor:
                (i) Prepares a written decision based upon a review of the record that the invention was neither conceived nor first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under the contract and delivers the decision to Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting Officer; or
                (ii) Contending that the invention is not a subject invention, the Contractor nevertheless discloses the invention and all facts pertinent to this contention to the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting Officer; or
                (iii) Establishes that the failure to disclose did not result from the Contractor's fault or negligence.
                (3) Pending written assignment of the patent application and patents on a subject invention determined by the Secretary of Energy or designee to be forfeited (such determination to be a final decision under the Disputes clause of this contract), the Contractor shall be deemed to hold the invention and the patent applications and patents pertaining thereto in trust for the Government. The forfeiture provision of this paragraph (m) shall be in addition to and shall not supersede other rights and remedies which the Government may have with respect to subject inventions.

                Right To Request Patent Waiver (FEB 1998)
                Offerors have the right to request a waiver of all or any part of the rights of the United States in inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of the contract that may be awarded as a result of this solicitation, in advance of or within 30 days after the effective date of contracting. Even where such advance waiver is not requested or the request is denied, the contractor will have a continuing right under the contract to request a waiver of the rights of the United States in identified inventions, i.e., individual inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of the contract. Domestic small businesses and domestic nonprofit organizations normally will receive the patent rights clause at DEAR 952.227-11 which permits the contractor to retain title to such inventions, except under contracts for management or operation of a Government-owned research and development facility or under contracts involving exceptional circumstances or intelligence activities. Therefore, small businesses and nonprofit organizations normally need not request a waiver. See the patent rights clause in the draft contract in this solicitation. See DOE's patent waiver regulations at 10 CFR part 784.

                Insurance—Litigation and Claims (JUL 2013)
                (a) The contractor must comply with 10 CFR part 719, contractor Legal Management Requirements, if applicable.
                (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the contractor shall procure and maintain such bonds and insurance as required by law or approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.
                (2) The contractor may, with the approval of the Contracting Officer, maintain a self-insurance program in accordance with FAR 28.308; provided that, with respect to workers' compensation, the contractor is qualified pursuant to statutory authority.
                (3) All bonds and insurance required by this clause shall be in a form and amount and for those periods as the Contracting Officer may require or approve and with sureties and insurers approved by the Contracting Officer.
                (c) The contractor agrees to submit for the Contracting Officer's approval, to the extent and in the manner required by the Contracting Officer, any other bonds and insurance that are maintained by the contractor in connection with the performance of this contract and for which the contractor seeks reimbursement. If an insurance cost (whether a premium for commercial insurance or related to self-insurance) includes a portion covering costs made unallowable elsewhere in the contract, and the share of the cost for coverage for the unallowable cost is determinable, the portion of the cost that is otherwise an allowable cost under this contract is reimbursable to the extent determined by the Contracting Officer.
                (d) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this clause, or specifically disallowed elsewhere in this contract, the contractor shall be reimbursed—
                (1) For that portion of the reasonable cost of bonds and insurance allocable to this contract required in accordance with contract terms or approved under this clause, and
                (2) For liabilities (and reasonable expenses incidental to such liabilities, including litigation costs) to third persons not compensated by insurance without regard to the limitation of cost or limitation of funds clause of this contract.
                (e) The Government's liability under paragraph (d) of this clause is subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Nothing in this contract shall be construed as implying that the Congress will, at a later date, appropriate funds sufficient to meet deficiencies.
                (f)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, the contractor shall not be reimbursed for liabilities to third parties, including contractor employees, and directly associated costs which may include but are not limited to litigation costs, counsel fees, judgment and settlements—
                (i) Which are otherwise unallowable by law or the provisions of this contract, including the cost reimbursement limitations contained in 48 CFR part 970.31, as supplemented by 48 CFR part 931;
                (ii) For which the contractor has failed to insure or to maintain insurance as required by law, this contract, or by the written direction of the Contracting Officer; or
                (iii) Which were caused by contractor managerial personnel's—
                (A) Willful misconduct;
                (B) Lack of good faith; or
                (C) Failure to exercise prudent business judgment, which means failure to act in the same manner as a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business; or, in the case of a non-profit educational institution, failure to act in the manner that a prudent person would under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision to incur the cost is made.
                (2) The term “contractor's managerial personnel” is defined in the Property clause in this contract.
                (g)(1) All litigation costs, including counsel fees, judgments and settlements shall be segregated and accounted for by the contractor separately. If the Contracting Officer provisionally disallows such costs, then the contractor may not use funds advanced by DOE under the contract to finance the litigation.
                (2) Punitive damages are not allowable unless the act or failure to act which gave rise to the liability resulted from compliance with specific terms and conditions of the contract or written instructions from the Contracting Officer.
                (3) The portion of the cost of insurance obtained by the contractor that is allocable to coverage of liabilities referred to in paragraph (f) of this clause is not allowable.
                (h) The contractor may at its own expense and not as an allowable cost procure for its own protection insurance to compensate the contractor for any unallowable or non-reimbursable costs incurred in connection with contract performance.

                Research Misconduct (JUL 2005)
                (a) The Contractor is responsible for maintaining the integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct as defined by this clause, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations, and adjudication of allegations of research misconduct in accordance with the requirements of this clause.
                (b) Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor must conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of research misconduct. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it must notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor must:
                (1) Conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.
                (2) If the investigation leads to a finding of research misconduct, conduct an adjudication by a responsible official who was not involved in the inquiry or investigation and is separated organizationally from the element which conducted the investigation. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.

                (3) Inform the Contracting Officer if an initial inquiry supports a formal investigation and, if requested by the Contracting Officer thereafter, keep the Contracting Officer informed of the results of the investigation and any subsequent adjudication. When an investigation is complete, the Contractor will forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).
                (c) The Department of Energy (DOE) may elect to act in lieu of the Contractor in conducting an inquiry or investigation into an allegation of research misconduct if the Contracting Officer finds that—
                (1) The research organization is not prepared to handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this clause;
                (2) The allegation involves an entity of sufficiently small size that it cannot reasonably conduct the inquiry;
                (3) DOE involvement is necessary to ensure the public heath, safety, and security, or to prevent harm to the public interest; or
                (4) The allegation involves possible criminal misconduct.
                (d) In conducting the activities under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause, the Contractor and the Department, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:
                (1) Safeguards for information and subjects of allegations. The Contractor shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the Contractor without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The Contractor shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.
                (2) Objectivity and expertise. The Contractor shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.
                (3) Timeliness. The Contractor shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.
                (4) Confidentiality. To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.
                (5) Remediation and sanction. If the Contractor finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The Contractor must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The Contractor must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The Contractor must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be considered and effected consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and shall take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.
                (e) DOE reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the award instrument and applicable laws and regulations. However, the Contractor's good faith administration of this clause and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.
                (f) Definitions.

                Technical Direction (DEC 2000)
                (a) Performance of the work under this contract shall be subject to the technical direction of the DOE Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The term “technical direction” is defined to include, without limitation:
                (1) Providing direction to the Contractor that redirects contract effort, shift work emphasis between work areas or tasks, require pursuit of certain lines of inquiry, fill in details, or otherwise serve to accomplish the contractual Statement of Work.
                (2) Providing written information to the Contractor that assists in interpreting drawings, specifications, or technical portions of the work description.
                (3) Reviewing and, where required by the contract, approving, technical reports, drawings, specifications, and technical information to be delivered by the Contractor to the Government.
                (b) The Contractor will receive a copy of the written COR designation from the Contracting Officer. It will specify the extent of the COR's authority to act on behalf of the Contracting Officer.
                (c) Technical direction must be within the scope of work stated in the contract. The COR does not have the authority to, and may not, issue any technical direction that—
                (1) Constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the Statement of Work;
                (2) Constitutes a change as defined in the contract clause entitled “Changes;”
                (3) In any manner causes an increase or decrease in the total estimated contract cost, the fee (if any), or the time required for contract performance;
                (4) Changes any of the expressed terms, conditions or specifications of the contract; or
                (5) Interferes with the Contractor's right to perform the terms and conditions of the contract.
                (d) All technical direction shall be issued in writing by the COR.
                (e) The Contractor must proceed promptly with the performance of technical direction duly issued by the COR in the manner prescribed by this clause and within its authority under the provisions of this clause. If, in the opinion of the Contractor, any instruction or direction by the COR falls within one of the categories defined in (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this clause, the Contractor must not proceed and must notify the Contracting Officer in writing within five (5) working days after receipt of any such instruction or direction and must request the Contracting Officer to modify the contract accordingly. Upon receiving the notification from the Contractor, the Contracting Officer must—
                (1) Advise the Contractor in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Contractor's letter that the technical direction is within the scope of the contract effort and does not constitute a change under the Changes clause of the contract;
                (2) Advise the Contractor in writing within a reasonable time that the Government will issue a written change order; or
                (3) Advise the Contractor in writing within a reasonable time not to proceed with the instruction or direction of the COR.
                (f) A failure of the Contractor and Contracting Officer either to agree that the technical direction is within the scope of the contract or to agree upon the contract action to be taken with respect to the technical direction will be subject to the provisions of the clause entitled “Disputes.”

              Insert the following clause in accordance with section 950.7006:
              
                Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement (AUG 2016)
                (a) Authority. This clause is incorporated into this contract pursuant to the authority contained in subsection 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (hereinafter called the Act.)
                (b) Definitions. The definitions set out in the Act shall apply to this clause.
                (c) Financial protection. Except as hereafter permitted or required in writing by DOE, the Contractor will not be required to provide or maintain, and will not provide or maintain at Government expense, any form of financial protection to cover public liability, as described in paragraph (d)(2) below. DOE may, however, at any time require in writing that the Contractor provide and maintain financial protection of such a type and in such amount as DOE shall determine to be appropriate to cover such public liability, provided that the costs of such financial protection are reimbursed to the Contractor by DOE.
                (d)(1) Indemnification. To the extent that the Contractor and other persons indemnified are not compensated by any financial protection permitted or required by DOE, DOE will indemnify the Contractor and other persons indemnified against (i) claims for public liability as described in subparagraph (d)(2) of this clause; and (ii) such legal costs of the Contractor and other persons indemnified as are approved by DOE, provided that DOE's liability, including such legal costs, shall not exceed the amount set forth in section 170e.(1)(B) of the Act in the aggregate for each nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation occurring within the United States or $500 million in the aggregate for each nuclear incident occurring outside the United States, irrespective of the number of persons indemnified in connection with this contract.
                (2) The public liability referred to in subparagraph (d)(1) of this clause is public liability as defined in the Act which (i) arises out of or in connection with the activities under this contract, including transportation; and (ii) arises out of or results from a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation, as those terms are defined in the Act.
                (e)(1) Waiver of defenses. In the event of a nuclear incident, as defined in the Act, arising out of nuclear waste activities, as defined in the Act, the Contractor, on behalf of itself and other persons indemnified, agrees to waive any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity.
                (2) In the event of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence which—
                (i) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of the construction, possession, or operation of a production or utilization facility; or
                (ii) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of transportation of source material, by-product material, or special nuclear material to or from a production or utilization facility; or
                (iii) Arises out of or results from the possession, operation, or use by the Contractor or a subcontractor of a device utilizing special nuclear material or by-product material, during the course of the contract activity; or
                (iv) Arises out of, results from, or occurs in the course of nuclear waste activities, the Contractor, on behalf of itself and other persons indemnified, agrees to waive—
                (A) Any issue or defense as to the conduct of the claimant (including the conduct of persons through whom the claimant derives its cause of action) or fault of persons indemnified, including, but not limited to—
                (1) Negligence;
                (2) Contributory negligence;
                (3) Assumption of risk; or
                (4) Unforeseeable intervening causes, whether involving the conduct of a third person or an act of God;
                (B) Any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity; and
                (C) Any issue or defense based on any statute of limitations, if suit is instituted within 3 years from the date on which the claimant first knew, or reasonably could have known, of his injury or change and the cause thereof. The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. The waiver shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with its terms by the claimant against the person indemnified.
                (v) The term extraordinary nuclear occurrence means an event which DOE has determined to be an extraordinary nuclear occurrence as defined in the Act. A determination of whether or not there has been an extraordinary nuclear occurrence will be made in accordance with the procedures in 10 CFR part 840.
                (vi) For the purposes of that determination, offsite as that term is used in 10 CFR part 840 means away from “the contract location” which phrase means any DOE facility, installation, or site at which contractual activity under this contract is being carried on, and any contractor-owned or controlled facility, installation, or site at which the Contractor is engaged in the performance of contractual activity under this contract.
                (3) The waivers set forth above—
                
                (i) Shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action;
                (ii) Shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with its terms by the claimant against the person indemnified;
                (iii) Shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages;
                (iv) Shall not apply to injury or damage to a claimant or to a claimant's property which is intentionally sustained by the claimant or which results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully caused by the claimant;
                (v) Shall not apply to injury to a claimant who is employed at the site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary nuclear occurrence takes place, if benefits therefor are either payable or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or occupational disease law;
                (vi) Shall not apply to any claim resulting from a nuclear incident occurring outside the United States;
                (vii) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set forth in this clause and in insurance policies, contracts or other proof of financial protection; and
                (viii) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection afforded under (A) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 170e. of the Act, and (B) the terms of this agreement and the terms of insurance policies, contracts, or other proof of financial protection.
                (f) Notification and litigation of claims. The Contractor shall give immediate written notice to DOE of any known action or claim filed or made against the Contractor or other person indemnified for public liability as defined in paragraph (d)(2). Except as otherwise directed by DOE, the Contractor shall furnish promptly to DOE, copies of all pertinent papers received by the Contractor or filed with respect to such actions or claims. DOE shall have the right to, and may collaborate with, the Contractor and any other person indemnified in the settlement or defense of any action or claim and shall have the right to (1) require the prior approval of DOE for the payment of any claim that DOE may be required to indemnify hereunder; and (2) appear through the Attorney General on behalf of the Contractor or other person indemnified in any action brought upon any claim that DOE may be required to indemnify hereunder, take charge of such action, and settle or defend any such action. If the settlement or defense of any such action or claim is undertaken by DOE, the Contractor or other person indemnified shall furnish all reasonable assistance in effecting a settlement or asserting a defense.
                (g) Continuity of DOE obligations. The obligations of DOE under this clause shall not be affected by any failure on the part of the Contractor to fulfill its obligation under this contract and shall be unaffected by the death, disability, or termination of existence of the Contractor, or by the completion, termination or expiration of this contract.
                (h) Effect of other clauses. The provisions of this clause shall not be limited in any way by, and shall be interpreted without reference to, any other clause of this contract, including the clause entitled Contract Disputes, provided, however, that this clause shall be subject to the clauses entitled Covenant Against Contingent Fees, and Accounts, records, and inspection, and any provisions that are later added to this contract as required by applicable Federal law, including statutes, executive orders and regulations, to be included in Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreements.
                (i) Civil penalties. The Contractor and its subcontractors and suppliers who are indemnified under the provisions of this clause are subject to civil penalties, pursuant to 234A of the Act, for violations of applicable DOE nuclear-safety related rules, regulations, or orders.
                (j) Criminal penalties. Any individual director, officer, or employee of the Contractor or of its subcontractors and suppliers who are indemnified under the provisions of this clause are subject to criminal penalties, pursuant to 223(c) of the Act, for knowing and willful violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and applicable DOE nuclear safety-related rules, regulations or orders which violation results in, or, if undetected, would have resulted in a nuclear incident.
                (k) Inclusion in subcontracts. The Contractor shall insert this clause in any subcontract which may involve the risk of public liability, as that term is defined in the Act and further described in paragraph (d)(2) above. However, this clause shall not be included in subcontracts in which the subcontractor is subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) financial protection requirements under section 170b. of the Act or NRC agreements of indemnification under section 170c. or k. of the Act for the activities under the subcontract.

Pursuant to the Price-Anderson Amendments Act, this substitution must have taken place by February 20, 1989.
                (2) Those that contained, and continue to contain, either of the previous Nuclear Hazards Indemnity clauses, include the effective date provision above, inserting “August 20, 1988.”
                (3) Those with an effective date between August 20, 1988, and the date of the Final Rule, that (a) had “interim coverage” or (b) did not have “interim coverage” but have now been determined to be covered under the PAAA, include the effective date provision above, inserting the contract effective date.
                Note III
                The following alternate will be added to the above Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement clause for all contracts that contain a general authority indemnity pursuant to 950.7101. Caution: Be aware that for contracts that will have this provision added which do not contain an effective date provision, this paragraph shall be marked (1). In the event an Effective Date provision has been included, it shall be market (m).

              Scope of part.

              This part provides Departmental policies, procedures, provisions, and clauses that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (Chapter 1 of Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) and other parts of the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) (Chapter 9 of Title 48 CFR) for the award and administration of the Department's management and operating contracts, as defined at 48 CFR subpart 17.6. The FAR and other parts of the DEAR apply to management and operating contracts. See 970.5200 for guidance regarding which provisions and clauses (from FAR, part 970, or other parts of the DEAR) to include in management and operating contracts.
              [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 36370, July 22, 2009; 75 FR 68219, Nov. 5, 2010]

              Publication and codification.
              (a) Organization of Part 970. (1) To the extent possible, the titles and text of the subparts, sections, and subsections of this part are numbered to correspond with related material that is contained in the FAR.
              (2) The number to the left of the decimal point represents the DEAR part number (i.e., 970). The numbers to the right of the decimal point and to the left of the dash represent, in order, the DEAR subpart (first two digits), and the DEAR section number (second two digits). The numbers to the right of the dash represent the DEAR subsection. A second dash may follow the DEAR subsection number.

              970.0370-1
              Policy.
              (a) Management and operating contractors shall develop and maintain systems of management and quality control to discourage waste, fraud and abuse; and to ensure that components, products, and services that are provided to the Department of Energy (DOE) satisfy the contractor's obligations under the contract.
              (b) As a part of the required overall management structure, the contractor must maintain management control systems which, in compliance with the requirements of the clause at 970.5203-1—
              (1) Are documented and satisfactory to DOE;
              (2) Ensure that all levels of management are accountable for effective management systems and internal controls within their areas of assigned responsibility;
              (3) Cover both programmatic and administrative functions;
              (4) Provide reasonable assurance that Government resources are safeguarded against theft, fraud, waste, and unauthorized use;
              (5) Promote efficient and effective operations;
              (6) Ensure that all obligations and costs incurred are in compliance with the intended purposes and the terms and conditions of the contract;

              (7) Properly record, manage, and report all revenues, expenditures, transactions and assets;
              
              (8) Maintain financial, statistical and other reports necessary to maintain accurate, reliable, and timely accountability and management controls; and
              (9) Are periodically reviewed to ensure that the systems provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system are being accomplished and that these controls are working effectively.
              (c) Management and operating contractors shall also develop and maintain a baseline program of quality assurance that will implement documented performance and quality standards, and management controls and assessment techniques to ensure components, services, and products meet DOE's, design criteria and other governing and applicable specifications.
              (d) DOE expects all its contractors to seek to identify improvements in any aspect of performance. Management and operating contracts are very large and complex; therefore, the opportunities to identify changes in performance that will increase the effectiveness or efficiency of contract performance are more prevalent than under other contracts. The clause at 970.5203-2 requires DOE management and operating contractors to affirmatively seek to identify, evaluate, and institute, where appropriate, processes that will improve the effectiveness or efficiency of any aspect of contract performance. It further requires the contractor to communicate any such improvements to DOE, other management and operating contractors, and DOE major facilities contractors. The contractor is required to participate in efforts by those contractors to address common problems or the institution of improvements. It allows the contractor to enlist the aid of the DOE contracting officer where necessary to institute or communicate the improvements. The obligations under the clause in no way affect the contractor's obligations under other provisions of the contract to notify or acquire the approval of the contracting officer.

              970.0371-2
              Applicability.
              The policies in this section are applicable to all DOE management and operating contractors.
            
            
              970.0371-3
              Definition.
              
                Employees, as used in this section, are defined to mean individuals employed by the contractor, both full and part-time, who are assigned to work under a DOE management and operating contract.
            
            
              970.0371-4
              Gratuities.
              Employees of a management and operating contractor shall not, under circumstances which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence the recipients in the conduct of their duties, accept any gratuity or special favor from individuals or organizations with whom the contractor is doing business, or proposing to do business, in accomplishing the work under the contract. Reference is made to the requirements prescribed in 48 CFR 3.502.
            
            
              970.0371-5
              Use of privileged information.

              Management and operating contractor employees shall not use privileged information for personal gain, or make other improper use of privileged information which is acquired in connection with their employment on contract work. For the purposes of this subsection, the term “privileged information” includes but is not limited to, unpublished information relating to technological and scientific developments; medical, personnel, or security records of individuals; anticipated materials' requirements or pricing action; possible new sites for DOE program operations; internal DOE decisions; policy development; and knowledge of selections of contractors or subcontractors in advance of official announcement.
            
            
              970.0371-6
              Incompatibility between regular duties and private interests.
              (a) Employees of a management and operating contractor shall not be permitted to make or influence any decisions on behalf of the contractor which directly or indirectly affect the interest of the Government, if the employee's personal concern in the matter may be incompatible with the interest of the Government. For example: An employee of a contractor will not negotiate, or influence the award of, a subcontract with a company in which the individual has an employment relationship or significant financial interest; and an employee of a contractor will not be assigned the preparation of an evaluation for DOE or for any DOE contractor of some technical aspect of the work of another organization with which the individual has an employment relationship, or significant financial interest, or which is a competitor of an organization (other than the contractor who is the individual's regular employer) in which the individual has an employment relationship or significant financial interest.
              (b) The contractor shall be responsible for informing employees that they are expected to disclose any incompatibilities between duties performed for the contractor and their private interests and to refer undecided questions to the contractor.
            
            
              970.0371-7
              Outside employment of contractor employees.
              Employees of a management and operating contractor are entitled to the same rights and privileges with respect to outside employment as other citizens. Therefore, there is no general prohibition against contractor employees having outside employment. However, no employee of a contractor performing work on a full or part-time basis under a DOE management and operating contract may engage in employment outside official hours of duty or while on leave if such employment will:
              (a) In any manner interfere with the proper and effective performance of the duties of the position;
              (b) Appear to create a conflict-of-interest situation, or
              (c) Appear to subject DOE or the contractor to public criticism or embarrassment.
            
            
              970.0371-8
              Employee disclosure concerning other employment services.
              (a) Management and operating contractors are responsible for requiring its employees to file with the contractor, a written disclosure statement concerning outside employment services which involve the use of information in the area of the employee's employment with the contractor. The disclosure shall contain such information concerning the outside employment as the contractor may prescribe. As a minimum, the employee's disclosure shall:
              (1) Acknowledge that the employee has read and is familiar with:
              (i) The requirements and restrictions prescribed in this section,
              (ii) DOE publication entitled, “Reporting Results of Scientific and Technical Work Funded by DOE”, and
              (iii) The requirements of the contractor's contract with DOE relating to patents.
              (2) Include information concerning any rate of remuneration significantly in excess of the employee's regular rate of remuneration;
              (3) Identify any actual or potential conflicts with DOE's policies regarding conduct of employees of DOE's contractors set forth in this section;
              (4) Address any potential impacts that such employment may have on the contractor's responsibility to report fully and promptly to DOE all significant research and development information; and

              (5) Identify any potential conflicts such employment may have with the patent provisions of the contractor's contract with DOE.
              
              (b) The contractor shall provide a copy of all disclosures to the contracting officer.

The approval authority of the Secretary of Energy required in paragraph (c) may not be delegated. In paragraph (a) the words “and managerial personnel (see 970.5245-1(j))” may be inserted after “(see 952.215-70)”.

              (b) Executive Order 12333, United States Intelligence Activities, provides for the organization and control of United States foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities. DOE has established a counterintelligence program subject to this Executive Order which is described in DOE Order 475.1, Counterintelligence Program, or its successor. All DOE elements, including management and operating contractors and other contractors managing DOE-owned facilities which require access authorizations, should undertake the necessary precautions to ensure that DOE and covered Contractor personnel, programs and resources are properly protected from foreign intelligence threats and activities.

              (c) For DOE management and operating contracts and other contracts designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, the clause entitled, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts,” implements the requirements of section 234B of the Atomic Energy Act (see 904.402(c)(1)) for the use of a contract clause that provides for an appropriate reduction in the fee or amount paid to the contractor under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any rule, regulation, or order relating to the safeguarding or security of Restricted Data or other classified information. The clause, in part, provides for reductions in the amount of fee, profit, or share of cost savings that is otherwise earned by the contractor for performance failures relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.

              970.0470-1
              General.
              (a) The contractor is required to comply with the requirements of applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, unless relief has been granted by the appropriate authority. For informational purposes, the contracting officer may append the contract with a list of applicable laws or regulations (see 970.5204-2, Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives, paragraph (a)).
              (b) The Department of Energy Directives System is a system of instructions, including orders, notices, manuals, guides, and standards, for Departmental elements. In certain circumstances, requirements contained in these directives may apply to a contractor through operation of a contract clause. Program and requirements personnel are responsible for identifying requirements in the Directives Program which are applicable to a contract, and for developing a list of applicable requirements and providing it to the contracting officer for inclusion in the contract.
              (c) Where directives requirements are established using either the Standards/Requirements Identification Process or the Work Smart Standards Process, the applicable process should also be used to establish the environment, safety, and health portion of the list identified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (d) Environmental, safety, and health (ES&H) requirements appropriate for work conducted under a management and operating contract may be determined by a DOE approved process to evaluate the work and the associated hazards, and identify an appropriately tailored set of standards, practices, and controls, such as a tailoring process included in a DOE approved Safety Management System implemented under 970.5223-1, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution. When such a process is used, the contracting officer shall ensure that the set of tailored requirements, as approved by DOE pursuant to the process, is incorporated into the list identified in paragraph (b) of this section. These requirements shall supersede, in whole or in part, the contractual environmental, safety, and health requirements previously made applicable to the contract by List B. If the tailored set of requirements identifies an alternative requirement which varies from an ES&H requirement of an otherwise applicable law or regulation, the contractor must request an exemption or other appropriate regulatory relief that may be specified in the governing regulation.

              Organizational and consultant conflicts of interest.
              Management and operating contracts shall contain an organizational conflict of interest clause substantially similar to the clause at 952.209-72, Organizational Conflicts of Interest, and which is appropriate to the statement of work of the individual contract. In addition, the contracting officer shall assure that the clause contains appropriate restraints on intra-corporate relations between the contractor's organization and personnel operating the Department's facility and its parent corporate body and affiliates. Such restraints shall include personnel access to the facility, technical transfer of information from the facility, and the availability from the facility of other advantages flowing from performance of the contract. The contracting officer is responsible for ensuring that M&O contractors adopt policies and procedures in the award of subcontracts that will meet the Department's need to safeguard against a biased work product and an unfair competitive advantage. To this end, the organizational conflicts of interest clause in management and operating contracts shall include Alternate I.

              Determination of responsibility.
              (a) In the award of a management and operating contract, the contracting officer shall determine that the prospective contractor is a responsible contractor and is capable of providing all necessary financial, personnel, and other resources in performance of the contract.
              (b) Department of Energy (DOE) contracts with entities that have been created solely for the purpose of performing a specific management and operating contract. Generally, such newly created entities will have very limited financial and other resources. In such instances, when making the determination of responsibility required under this section, the contracting officer may evaluate the financial resources of other entities only to the extent that those entities are legally bound, jointly and severally if more than one, by means of a performance guarantee or other equivalent enforceable commitment to supply the necessary resources to the prospective contractor and to assume all contractual obligations of the prospective contractor. A performance guarantee should be the means used unless an equivalent degree of commitment can be obtained by an alternative means.
              (c) The guaranteeing corporate entity(ies) must be found to have sufficient resources in order to satisfy its guarantee.

              Performance-based contracting.

              (a) It is the policy of the Department of Energy (DOE) to use, to the maximum extent practicable, performance-based contracting methods in its management and operating contracts. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy's Seven Steps to Performance-Based Acquisition located at Web site http://www.acquisition.gov/comp/seven_steps/home.html provides guidance concerning the development and use of performance-based contracting concepts and methodologies that may be generally applied to management and operating contracts. Performance-based contracts: Describe performance requirements in terms of results rather than methods of accomplishing the work; use measurable (i.e., terms of quality, timeliness, quantity) performance standards and objectives and quality assurance surveillance plans; provide performance incentives (positive or negative) where appropriate; and specify procedures for award or incentive fee reduction when work activities are not performed or do not meet contract requirements.
              (b) The use of performance-based statements of work, where feasible, is the preferred method for establishing work requirements. Such statements of work and other documents used to establish work requirements (such as work authorization directives) should describe performance requirements and expectations in terms of outcome, results, or final work products, as opposed to methods, processes, or design.
              (c) Contract performance requirements and expectations should be consistent with the Department's strategic planning goals and objectives, as made applicable to the site or facility through Departmental programmatic and financial planning processes. Measurable performance criteria, objective measures, and where appropriate, performance incentives, shall be structured to correspond to the performance requirements established in the statement of work and other documents used to establish work requirements.
              (d) Quality assurance surveillance plans shall be developed to facilitate the assessment of contractor performance and ensure the appropriateness of any award or incentive fee payment. Such plans shall be tailored to the contract performance objectives, criteria, and measures, and shall, to the maximum extent practicable, focus on the level of performance required by the performance objectives rather than the methodology used by the contractor to achieve that level of performance.

              Additional considerations.
              (a) While it is not feasible to set forth standard language which would apply to every contract situation, language must be designed for inclusion in a management and operating contract to describe clearly the work being undertaken; the controls, as appropriate, to be exercised by DOE over the performance of that work; and the relationship contemplated between the parties.
              (b) The language shall also include the following with respect to subcontracting performance of the work described pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section: “The contractor shall, when directed by DOE and may, but only when authorized by DOE, enter into subcontracts for the performance of any part of the work under this clause.”
              (c) The provisions required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be set forth in the statement of work of the contract.

              Each contract for the management and operation of a DOE site or facility, and other contracts designated by the DOE or the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Senior Procurement Executive, must contain a scope of work section that describes, in general terms, work planned and/or required to be performed. Work to be performed under the contract shall be assigned through the use of a work authorization to control individual work activities performed within the scope of work. Work authorizations must be issued prior to the commencement of the work and incurrence of any costs.

              Fees for management and operating contracts.
              This subsection sets forth the Department's policies on fees for management and operating contracts and may be applied to other contracts as determined by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee.
              [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 36378, July 22, 2009]
            
            
              970.1504-1-2
              Fee policy.
              (a) DOE management and operating contractors may be paid a fee in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.
              (b) There are three basic principles underlying the Department's fee policy:
              (1) The amount of available fee should reflect the financial risk assumed by the contractor.
              (2) It is the policy of the Department, when work elements cannot be fixed price, incentive fees (including award fees) tied to objective measures should be used to the maximum extent appropriate.
              (3) When work elements cannot be fixed price and award fees are employed, they should be tied to either objective or subjective measures. Each measure should, to the maximum extent appropriate, be directly tied to a specific portion of the fee pool.
              (c) Fee objectives and amounts are to be determined for each contract. Standard fees or across-the-board fee agreements will not be used or made. Due to the nature of funding management and operating contracts, it is anticipated that fee shall be established in accordance with the annual funding cycle; however, with the prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, a longer period may be used where necessary to incentivize performance objectives that span funding cycles or to optimize cost reduction efforts.
              (d) Annual fee amounts shall be established in accordance with this subsection. Annual amounts shall not exceed maximum amounts derived from the appropriate fee schedule (and Classification Factor, if applicable) unless approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. In no event shall any fee exceed statutory limits imposed by 41 U.S.C. 254(b).
              (e)(1) Contracting Officers shall include negative fee incentives in contracts when appropriate. A negative fee incentive is one in which the contractor will not be paid the full target fee amount when the actual performance level falls below the target level established in the contract.
              (2) Negative fee incentives may only be used when—
              (i) A target level of performance can be established, which the contractor can reasonably be expected to reach;
              (ii) The value of the negative incentive is commensurate with the lower level of performance and any additional administrative costs;
              (iii) Factors likely to prevent attainment of the target level of performance are clearly within the control of the contractor; and
              (iv) The contract indicates clearly a level below which performance is not acceptable.

              (f) Prior to the issuance of a competitive solicitation or the initiation of negotiations for an extension of an existing contract, the HCA shall coordinate the maximum available fee, as allowed by 970.1504-1-1, and the fee amount targeted for negotiation, if less, with the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. Solicitations shall identify maximum available fee under the contract and may invite offerors to propose fee less than the maximum available.
              (g) When a contract subject to this subsection requires a contractor to use its own facilities or equipment, or other resources to make its own cost investment for contract performance, (e.g., when there is no letter-of-credit financing) consideration may be given, subject to approval by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, to increasing the total available fee amount above that otherwise provided by this subsection.
              (h) Multiple fee arrangements should be used in accordance with 970.1504-1-4.
              (i)(1) In addition to other performance requirements specified in the contract, DOE management and operating contractors and other contractors designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, are subject to performance requirements relating to: environment, safety, and health (ES&H), including worker safety and health (WS&H); and safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. Performance requirements relating to ES&H will be set forth in the contract's ES&H terms and conditions, including a DOE approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), or similar document. As applicable, performance requirements relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information will be set forth in the clauses of the contract entitled “Security” and “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” as well as in other terms and conditions that prescribe requirements for the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.
              (2) If the contractor does not meet the performance requirements of the contract relating to ES&H or to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information, otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings may be unilaterally reduced by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts.”
              (3) The clause entitled “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts,” provides for reductions of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings under the contract depending upon the severity of the contractor's performance failure relating to ES&H requirements and, if applicable, relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. When reviewing performance failures that would otherwise warrant a potential reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range specified in the clause. Some of the mitigating factors that must be considered are included in the clause.
              (4) The contracting officer must obtain the concurrence of the cognizant Program Secretarial Officer
              (i) Prior to effecting any reduction of fee or profit in accordance with the terms and conditions of the clause entitled, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts;” and
              (ii) For determinations that no reduction of fee or profit is warranted for a particular performance failure(s) that would otherwise be subject to a reduction.

              970.1504-1-3
              Special considerations: Laboratory management and operation.
              (a) For the management and operation of a laboratory, the contracting officer shall consider whether any fee is appropriate. Considerations should include:
              (1) The nature and extent of financial or other liability or risk assumed or to be assumed under the contract;
              (2) The proportion of retained earnings (as established under generally accepted accounting methods) that are utilized to fund the performance of work related to the DOE contracted effort;

              (3) Facilities capital or capital equipment acquisition plans;
              
              (4) Other funding needs, to include contingency funding, working capital funding, and provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed ordinary and necessary;
              (5) The utility of fee as a performance incentive; and
              (6) The need for fee to attract qualified contractors, organizations, and institutions.
              (b) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting officer shall determine the amount of fee in accordance with this subsection.
              (1) Costs incurred in the operation of a laboratory that are allowable and allocable under the cost principles (i.e., commercial using 48 CFR 31.2, nonprofit using OMB Circular A-122, or university-affiliated using OMB Circular A-21), regulations (including subpart 970.31), or statutes applicable to the operating contractor should be classified as direct or indirect (overhead or G&A) charges to the contract and not included as proposed fee. Exceptions must be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee.
              (2) Except as specified in 970.1504-1-3(c)(3), the maximum total amount of fee shall be calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5 or 970.1504-1-9, as appropriate. The total amount of fee under any laboratory management and operating contract or other designated contract shall not exceed, and may be significantly less than, the result of that calculation. In determining the total amount of fee, the contracting officer shall consider the evaluation of the factors in paragraph (a) of this subsection as well as any benefits the laboratory operator will receive due to its tax status.
              (c) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting officer shall establish the type of fee arrangement in accordance with this subsection.
              (1) The amount of fee may be established as total available fee with a base fee portion and a performance fee portion. Base fee, if any, shall be an amount in recognition of the risk of financial liability assumed by the contractor and shall not exceed the cost risk associated with those liabilities or the amount calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less. The total available fee, excepting any base fee, shall normally be associated with performance at or above the target level of performance as defined by the contract. If performance in either of the two general work categories appropriate for laboratories (science/technology and support) is rated at less than the target level of performance, the total amount of the available fee shall be subject to downward adjustment. Such downward adjustment shall be subject to the terms of the clause at 970.5215-3, Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts, if contained in the contract.
              (2) The amount of fee may be established as a fixed fee in recognition of the risk of financial liability to be assumed by the contractor, with such fixed fee amount not exceeding the cost risk associated with the liabilities assumed or the amount of fee calculated in accordance with 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less.
              (3) If the fixed fee or total available fee exceeds 75% of the fee that would be calculated per 970.1504-1-5 or 970.1504-1-9; or if a fee arrangement other than one of those set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) or (2) of this subsection is considered appropriate, the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, shall be obtained prior to its use.
              (4) Fee, if any, as well as the type of fee arrangement, will normally be established for the life of the contract. It will be established at time of award, as part of the extend/compete decision, at the time of option exercise, or at such other time as the parties can mutually reach agreement, e.g., negotiations. Such agreement shall require the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee.
              (5) Fee established for longer than one year shall be subject to adjustment in the event of a significant change (greater than ±10% or a lessor amount if appropriate) to the budget or work scope.
              (6) Retained earnings (reserves) shall be identified and a plan for their use and disposition developed.

              (7) The use of retained earnings as a result of performance of laboratory management and operation may be restricted if the operator is an educational institution.
              [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 68 FR 68781, Dec. 10, 2003; 74 FR 36371, 36378, July 22, 2009]
            
            
              970.1504-1-4
              Types of contracts and fee arrangements.
              (a) Contract types and fee arrangements suitable for management and operating contracts may include cost, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, firm-fixed-price or any combination thereof (see 48 CFR subpart 16.1). In accordance with 48 CFR 970.1504-1-2(b)(1), the fee arrangement chosen for each work element should reflect the financial risk for project failure that contractors are willing to accept. Contracting officials shall structure each contract and the elements of the work in such a manner that the risk is manageable and, therefore, assumable by the contractor.
              (b) Consistent with the concept of a performance-based management contract, those contract types which incentivize performance and cost control are preferred over a cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangement. Accordingly, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract in instances other than those set forth in 970.1504-1-3(c)(2) may only be used when approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee.
              (c) A cost-plus-award-fee contract is generally the appropriate contract type for a management and operating contract.
              (1) Where work cannot be adequately defined to the point that a fixed price contract is acceptable, the attainment of acquisition objectives generally will be enhanced by using a cost-plus-award-fee contract or other incentive fee arrangement to effectively motivate the contractor to superior performance and to provide the Department with flexibility to evaluate actual performance and the conditions under which it was achieved.
              (2) The construct of fee for a cost-plus-award-fee management and operating contract is that total available fee will equal a base fee amount and a performance fee amount. The total available fee amount including the performance fee amount the contractor may earn, in whole or in part during performance, shall be established annually (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee), in an amount sufficient to motivate performance excellence.
              (3) However, consistent with concepts of performance-based contracting, it is Departmental policy to place fee at risk based on performance. Accordingly, a base fee amount will be available only when approved in advance by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, except as permitted in 970.1504-1-3(c)(1). Any base fee amount shall be fixed, expressed as a percent of the total available fee at inception of the contract, and shall not exceed that percent during the life of the contract.
              (4) The performance fee amount may consist of an objective fee component and a subjective fee component. Objective performance measures, when appropriately applied, provide greater incentives for superior performance than do subjective performance measures and should be used to the maximum extent appropriate. Subjective measures should be used when it is not feasible to devise effective predetermined objective measures applicable to cost, technical performance, or schedule for particular work elements.
              (d) Consistent with performance-based contracting concepts, performance objectives and measures related to performance fee should be as clearly defined as possible and, where feasible, expressed in terms of desired performance results or outcomes. Specific measures for determining performance achievement should be used. The contract should identify the amount and allocation of fee to each performance result or outcome.

              (e) Because the nature and complexity of the work performed under a management and operating contract may be varied, opportunities may exist to utilize multiple contract types and fee arrangements. Consistent with paragraph (a) of this subsection and 48 CFR subpart 16.1, the contracting officer should apply that contract type or fee arrangement most appropriate to the work component. However, multiple contract types or fee arrangements—
              (1) Must conform to the requirements of 48 CFR part 915 and 48 CFR parts 15 and 16, and
              (2) Where appropriate to the type, must be supported by—
              (i) Negotiated costs subject to the requirements of the Truth in Negotiations Act,
              (ii) A pre-negotiation memorandum, and
              (iii) A plan describing how each contract type or fee arrangement will be administered.
              (f) Cost reduction incentives are addressed in the clause at 970.5215-4, Cost Reduction. This clause provides for incentives for quantifiable cost reductions associated with contractor proposed changes to a design, process, or method that has an established cost, technical, and schedule baseline, is defined, and is subject to a formal control procedure. The clause is to be included in management and operating contracts as appropriate. Proposed changes must be: Initiated by the contractor, innovative, applied to a specific project or program, and not otherwise included in an incentive under the contract. Such cost reduction incentives do not constitute fee and are not subject to statutory or regulatory fee limitations; however, they are subject to all appropriate requirements set forth in this subpart.
              (g) Operations and field offices shall take the lead in developing and implementing the most appropriate pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive for the requirements. Pricing arrangements which provide incentives for performance and cost control are preferred over those that do not. The operations and field offices are to ensure that the necessary resources and infrastructure exist within both the contractor's and government's organizations to prepare, evaluate, and administer the pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive prior to its implementation.

              970.1504-1-5
              General considerations and techniques for determining fixed fees.
              (a) The Department's fee policy recognizes that fee is remuneration to contractors for the entrepreneurial function of organizing and managing resources, the use of their resources (including capital resources), and, as appropriate, their assumption of the risk that some incurred costs (operating and capital) may not be reimbursed.
              (b) Use of a purely cost-based structured approach for determining fee objectives and amounts for DOE management and operating contracts is inappropriate considering the limited level of contractor cost, capital goods, and operating capital outlays for performance of such contracts. Instead of being solely cost-based, the desirable approach calls for a structure that allows evaluation of the following eight significant factors, as outlined in order of importance, and the assignment of appropriate fee values (subject to the limitations on fixed fee in 970.1504-1-6)—
              (1) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type and terms of the contract;
              (2) The relative difficulty of work, including specific performance objectives, environment, safety and health concerns, and the technical and administrative knowledge, and skill necessary for work accomplishment and experience;
              (3) Management risk relating to performance, including—
              (i) Composite risk and complexity of principal work tasks required to do the job;
              (ii) Labor intensity of the job;
              (iii) Special control problems; and
              (iv) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements;
              (4) Degree and amount of contract work required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources, as compared to the nature and degree of subcontracting and the relative complexity of subcontracted efforts, subcontractor management and integration;

              (5) Size and operation (number of locations, plants, differing operations, etc.);
              
              (6) Influence of alternative investment opportunities available to the contractor (i.e., the extent to which undertaking a task for the Government displaces a contractor's opportunity to make a profit with the same staff and equipment in some other field of activity);
              (7) Benefits which may accrue to the contractor from gaining experience and knowledge of how to do something, from establishing or enhancing a reputation, or from having the opportunity to hold or expand a staff whose loyalties are primarily to the contractor; and
              (8) Other special considerations, including support of Government programs such as those relating to small and minority business subcontracting, energy conservation, etc.
              (c) The total fee objective for a particular annual fixed fee negotiation is established by evaluating the factors in this subsection, assigning fee values to them, and totaling the resulting amounts (subject to limitations on total fixed fee in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-6).

              970.1504-1-6
              Calculating fixed fee.
              (a) In recognition of the complexities of the fee determination process, and to assist in promoting a reasonable degree of consistency and uniformity in its application, the following fee schedules set forth the maximum amounts of fee that contracting activities are allowed to award for a particular fixed fee transaction calculated annually.
              (b) Fee schedules representing the maximum allowable annual fixed fee available under management and operating contracts have been established for the following management and operating contract efforts—
              (1) Production;
              (2) Research and Development; and
              (3) Environmental Management.
              (c) The schedules are:

              970.1504-1-7
              Fee base.
              (a) The fee base is an estimate of necessary allowable costs, with some exclusions. It is used in the fee schedules to determine the maximum annual fee for a fixed fee contract. That portion of the fee base that represents the cost of the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed, shall be exclusive of the cost of source and special nuclear materials; estimated costs of land, buildings and facilities whether to be leased, purchased or constructed; depreciation of Government facilities; and any estimate of effort for which a separate fee is to be negotiated.
              (b) Such portion of the fee base, in addition to the adjustments in paragraph (a) of this subsection, shall exclude—
              (1) Any part of the estimated cost of capital equipment (other than special equipment) which the contractor procures by subcontract or other similar costs which is of such magnitude or nature as to distort the technical and management effort actually required of the contractor;
              (2) At least 20% of the estimated cost or price of subcontracts and other major contractor procurements;
              (3) Up to 100% of the estimated cost or price of subcontracts and other major contractor procurements if they are of a magnitude or nature as to distort the technical and management effort actually required of the contractor;
              (4) Special equipment as defined in 970.1504-1-8;
              (5) Estimated cost of Government-furnished property, services and equipment;
              (6) All estimates of costs not directly incurred by or reimbursed to the operating contractor;
              (7) Estimates of home office or corporate general and administrative expenses that shall be reimbursed through the contract;
              (8) Estimates of any independent research and development cost or bid and proposal expenses that may be approved under the contract;
              (9) Any cost of work funded with uncosted balances previously included in a fee base of this or any other contract performed by the contractor;
              (10) Cost of rework attributable to the contractor; and
              (11) State taxes.
              (c) In calculating the annual fee amounts associated with the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed, the fee base is to be allocated to the category reflecting the work to be performed and the appropriate fee schedule utilized.
              (d) The portion of the fee base associated with the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed and the associated schedules in this part are not intended to reflect the portion of the fee base or related compensation for unusual architect-engineer, construction services, or special equipment provided by the management and operating contractor. Architect-engineer and construction services are normally covered by special agreements based on the policies applying to architect-engineer or construction contracts. Fees paid for such services shall be calculated using the provisions of 915.404-4-71-5 relating to architect-engineer or construction fees and shall be in addition to the operating fees calculated for the Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed. Special equipment purchases shall be addressed in accordance with the provisions of 970.1504-1-8 relating to special equipment.
              (e) No schedule set forth in 915.404-4-71-5 or 970.1504-1-6 shall be used more than once in the determination of the fee amount for an annual period, unless prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, is obtained.
              [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 36371, 36378, July 22, 2009]
            
            
              970.1504-1-8
              Special equipment purchases.

              (a) Special equipment is sometimes procured in conjunction with management and operating contracts. When a contractor procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees for the equipment which shall not exceed the maximum fee allowable as established using the schedule in 915.404-4-71-5(h).
              
              (b) In determining appropriate fees, factors such as complexity of equipment, ratio of procurement transactions to volume of equipment to be purchased and completeness of services should be considered. Where possible, the reasonableness of the fees should be checked by their relationship to actual costs of comparable procurement services.
              (c) For purposes of this subsection, special equipment is equipment for which the purchase price is of such a magnitude compared to the cost of installation as to distort the amount of technical direction and management effort required of the contractor. Special equipment is of a nature that requires less management attention. When a contractor procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees for the equipment using the schedule in 915.404-4-71-5(h). The determination of specific items of equipment in this category requires application of judgment and careful study of the circumstances involved in each project. This category of equipment would generally include:
              (1) Major items of prefabricated process or research equipment; and
              (2) Major items of preassembled equipment such as packaged boilers, generators, machine tools, and large electrical equipment. In some cases, it would also include special apparatus or devices such as reactor vessels and reactor charging machines.

              970.1504-1-9
              Special considerations: Cost-plus-award-fee.
              (a) When a management and operating contract is to be awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis, several special considerations are appropriate.
              (b) All annual performance incentives identified under these contracts are funded from the annual total available fee, which consists of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (which typically will consist of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both).
              (c) The annual total available fee for the contract shall equal the product of the fee(s) that would have been calculated for an annual fixed fee contract and the classification factor(s) most appropriate for the facility/task. If more than one fee schedule is applicable to the contract, the annual total available fee shall be the sum of the available fees derived proportionately from each fee schedule; consideration of significant factors applicable to each fee schedule; and application of a Classification Factor(s) most appropriate for the work.
              (d) Classification Factors applied to each Facility/Task Category are:
              
                
                  Facility/task category

              (e) The contracting officer shall select the Facility/Task Category after considering the following:
              (1) Facility/Task Category A. The main focus of effort performed is related to—
              (i) The manufacture, assembly, retrieval, disassembly, or disposal of nuclear weapons with explosive potential;
              (ii) The physical cleanup, processing, handling, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals with consideration given to the degree the nature of the work advances state of the art technologies in cleanup, processing or storage operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is significantly demanding when compared to similar industrial/DOE settings (i.e., nuclear energy processing, industrial environmental cleanup);
              (iii) Construction of facilities such as nuclear reactors, atomic particle accelerators, or complex laboratories or industrial units especially designed for handling radioactive materials;
              (iv) Research and development directly supporting paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection and not conducted in a laboratory, or
              (v) As designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. (Classification factor 3.0)
              (2) Facility/Task Category B. The main focus of effort performed is related to—
              
              (i) The safeguarding and maintenance of nuclear weapons or nuclear material;
              (ii) The manufacture or assembly of nuclear components;
              (iii) The physical cleanup, processing, handling, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals, or other substances which pose a significant threat to the environment or the health and safety of workers or the public, if the nature of the work uses state of the art technologies or applications in such operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is more demanding than that found in similar industrial/DOE settings (i.e., nuclear energy, chemical or petroleum processing, industrial environmental cleanup);
              (iv) The detailed planning necessary for the assembly/disassembly of nuclear weapons/components;
              (v) Construction of facilities involving operations requiring a high degree of design layout or process control;
              (vi) Research and development directly supporting paragraphs (e)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this subsection and not conducted in a laboratory; or
              (vii) As designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. (Classification factor 2.5)
              (3) Facility/Task Category C. The main focus of effort performed is related to—
              (i) The physical cleanup, processing, or storage of nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals if the nature of the work uses routine technologies in cleanup, processing or storage operations and/or the inherent difficulty or risk of the work is similar to that found in similar industrial/DOE settings (i.e., nuclear energy, chemical processing, industrial environmental cleanup);
              (ii) Plant and facility maintenance;
              (iii) Plant and facility security (other than the safeguarding of nuclear weapons and material);
              (iv) Construction of facilities involving operations requiring normal processes and operations; general or administrative service buildings; or routine infrastructure requirements;
              (v) Research and development directly supporting paragraphs (e)(3)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this subsection and not conducted in a laboratory; or
              (vi) As designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. (Classification factor 2.0)
              (4) Facility/Task Category D. The main focus of the effort performed is research and development conducted at a laboratory. (Classification factor 1.25)
              (f) Where the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, has approved a base fee, the Classification Factors shall be reduced, as approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee.
              (g) Any risks which are indemnified by the Government (for example, by the Price-Anderson Act) will not be considered as risk to the contractor.
              (h) All management and operating contracts awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis shall set forth in the contract, or the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) required by the contract clause at 970.5215-1, Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount, a site specific method of rating the contractor's performance of the contract requirements and a method of fee determination tied to the method of rating.
              (i) Prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, is required for an annual total available fee amount exceeding the guidelines in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
              (j) DOE Operations/Field Office Managers must ensure that all important areas of contract performance are specified in the contract or Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s), even if such areas are not assigned specific weights or percentages of available fee.

              Special considerations: Fee limitations.

              In situations where the objective performance incentives are of unusual difficulty or where the successful completion of the performance incentives would provide extraordinary value to the Government, fees in excess of those allowed under 970.1504-1-5 and 970.1504-1-9 may be allowed with the approval of the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee. Requests to allow fees in excess of those provided under other provisions of this fee policy must be accompanied by a written justification with detailed supporting rationale as to how the specific circumstances satisfy the two criteria listed in this subsection.

              Award, renewal, and extension.
              (a) Contract term. Effective work performance under a management and operating contract is facilitated by the use of a relatively long contract term of up to ten (10) years. Accordingly, management and operating contracts shall provide for a basic contract term not to exceed five (5) years and may include an option(s) to extend the term for additional periods; provided, that no one option period exceeds five (5) years in duration and the total term of the contract, including any options exercised, does not exceed ten (10) years. The specific term of the base period and of any options periods shall be determined at the time of the authorization to compete or extend the contract. The term “option” as used in this subpart means a unilateral right in the contract by which the Government can extend the term of the contract. Accordingly, except as may be provided for through the inclusion of an option(s) in the contract to extend the term, any extension to continue the contract with the incumbent contractor beyond its term shall only occur when such extension can be justified under one of the statutory authorities identified in 48 CFR 6.302 and when authorized by the Head of the Agency.
              (b) Exercise of option. As part of the review required by 48 CFR 17.605(b), the contracting officer shall assess whether competing the contract will produce a more advantageous offer than exercising the option. The incumbent contractor's past performance under the contract, the extent to which performance-based management contract provisions are present, or can be negotiated into, the contract, and the impact of a change in a contractor on the Department's discharge of its programs are considerations that shall be addressed in the contracting officer's decision that the exercise of the option is in the Government's best interest. The contracting officer's decision shall be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive and the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s).
              (c) Conditional Authorization of Non-competitive Extension Made Pursuant to Authority Under CICA. Authorization to extend a management and operating contract by the Head of the Agency shall be considered conditional upon the successful negotiation of the contract to be extended in accordance with the Department's negotiation objectives. The Head of the Contracting Activity shall advise the Senior Procurement Executive no later than 6 months after receipt of the conditional authorization as to whether the Department's objectives will be met and, if not, the contracting activity's plans for competing the requirement.

              970.1707-2
              Purpose.
              The purpose of DOE's Strategic Partnership Projects Program is to—
              (a) Provide access for non-DOE entities to highly specialized or unique DOE facilities, services, or technical expertise, when private facilities are inadequate;
              (b) Increase research and development interactions among DOE's management and operating contractors and industry in order to transfer DOE technologies to industry for further development or commercialization;
              (c) Maintain facility core competencies;
              (d) Enhance the science and technology capabilities at DOE facilities; and
              (e) Provide assistance to other Federal agencies and non-Federal entities in accomplishing goals that may otherwise be unattainable and to avoid the possible duplication of effort at Federal facilities.

              970.1707-3
              Terms governing Strategic Partnership Projects.
              (a) DOE's internal review and approval procedural requirements for individual strategic partnership projects agreements are set forth in DOE Order 481.1C (as supplemented by DOE Manual 481.1-1A for agreements with non-Federal entities), which may be amended from time to time, and such other guidance as may be issued by DOE. Contracting officers must ensure that the contractor's procedures for its operations are consistent with DOE's procedural requirements.
              (b) A contractor may perform work for other Federal or non-Federal sponsors only if—
              (1) The contractor is authorized by contract clause to perform such work;
              (2) The work is not directly funded by DOE appropriations and is fully reimbursed by the sponsor;
              (3) The DOE Contracting Officer or authorized designee approves the work in advance; and

              (4) The work is performed in accordance with DOE policies, procedures and directives applicable to the contract.
              
              (c) Contracting officers must ensure that the requesting Federal entity certifies that—
              (1) The interagency agreement with DOE complies with the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.S.C. 1535) and other applicable statutory authorities and 48 CFR 6.002, which prohibits the use of an Interagency Agreement for the purpose of avoiding the competition requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and
              (2) The work to be performed will not place the DOE contractor in direct competition with the domestic private sector.

              Contracting officers shall, in appropriate circumstances, follow the requirements in 48 CFR subpart 22.1, as supplemented in this section, in the award and administration of management and operating contracts.
              [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 23126, May 18, 2009; 75 FR 68220, Nov. 5, 2010]
            
            
              970.2201-1-2
              Policies.
              (a) The extent of Government ownership of the nation's energy plant and materials, and the overriding concerns of national defense and security, impose special conditions on personnel and labor relations in the energy program. Such special conditions include the need for continuity of vital operations at DOE installations; retention by DOE of absolute authority on all questions of security; and DOE review of labor expenses under management and operating contracts as a part of its responsibility for assuring judicious expenditure of public funds. It is the intent of DOE that personnel and labor policies throughout the energy program reflect the best experience of American industry in aiming to achieve the type of stable labor-management relations that are essential to the proper development of the energy program. The following enunciates the principles upon which the DOE policy is based:
              (1) Employment standards. (i) Management and operating contractors are expected to bring experienced, proven personnel from their private operations to staff key positions on the contract and to recruit other well-qualified personnel as needed. Such personnel should be employed and treated during employment without discrimination by reason of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin. Contractors shall be required to take affirmative action to achieve these objectives.
              (ii) The Contractor must conduct a thorough review, as defined at 904.401, of an uncleared applicant's or uncleared employee's background, and test the individual for illegal drugs, as part of its determination to select that individual for a position requiring a DOE access authorization.
              (A) A review must— Verify an uncleared applicant's or uncleared employee's educational background, including any high school diploma obtained within the past five years, and degrees or diplomas granted by an institution of higher learning; contact listed employers for the last three years and listed personal references; conduct local law enforcement checks when such checks are not prohibited by state or local law or regulation and when the uncleared applicant or uncleared employee resides in the jurisdiction where the contractor is located; and conduct a credit check and other checks as appropriate.
              (B) Contractor reviews are not required for an applicant for DOE access authorization who possesses a current access authorization from DOE or another federal agency, or whose access authorization may be reapproved without a federal background investigation pursuant to Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information (August 4, 1995), Sections 3.3(c) and (d).
              (C) In collecting and using this information to make a determination as to whether it is appropriate to select an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee for a position requiring an access authorization, the contractor must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those—
              (1) Governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information by employers, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; and
              (2) Prohibiting discrimination in employment, such as under the ADA, Title VII and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, including with respect to pre- and post-offer of employment disability related questioning.

              (iii) In addition to a review, each candidate for a DOE access authorization must be tested to demonstrate the absence of any illegal drug, as defined in 10 CFR 707.4. All positions requiring access authorizations are deemed testing designated positions in accordance with 10 CFR part 707. All employees possessing access authorizations are subject to applicant, random or for cause testing for use of illegal drugs. DOE will not process candidates for a DOE access authorization unless their tests confirm the absence of any illegal drug.
              (iv) When an uncleared applicant or uncleared employee is hired specifically for a position that requires a DOE access authorization, the contractor shall not place that individual in that position prior to the access authorization being granted by DOE, unless an approval has been obtained from the contracting officer, acting in consultation for these purposes with the head of the cognizant local security office. If an uncleared employee is placed in that position prior to an access authorization being granted by the contracting officer, the uncleared employee may not be afforded access to classified information or matter or special nuclear material (in categories requiring access authorization) until the contracting officer notifies the employer that an access authorization has been granted.
              (v)(A) The contractor must furnish to the head of the cognizant local DOE Security Office, in writing, the following information concerning each uncleared applicant or uncleared employee who is selected for a position requiring an access authorization—
              (1) The date(s) each review was conducted;
              (2) Each entity contacted that provided information concerning the individual;
              (3) A certification that the review was conducted in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders, including those governing the processing and privacy of an individual's information collected during the review;
              (4) A certification that all information collected during the review was reviewed and evaluated in accordance with the contractor's personnel policies; and
              (5) The results of the test for illegal drugs.
              When a DOE access authorization will be required, the aforementioned review must be conducted and the required information forwarded to DOE before a request is made to DOE to process the individual for an access authorization.
              (vi) Management and operating contractors and other contractors operating DOE facilities shall include the requirements set forth in this subsection in subcontracts (appropriately modified to identify the parties) wherein subcontract employees will be required to hold DOE access authorizations in order to perform on-site duties, such as protective force operations.
              (2) Security. On all matters of security at its facilities, DOE retains absolute authority and neither the regulations and policies pertaining to security, nor their administration, are matters for collective bargaining between the contractor's management and labor. Insofar as DOE security regulations affect the collective bargaining process, the security policies and regulations will be made known to both parties. To the fullest extent feasible, DOE will consult with representatives of the contractor's management and labor when formulating security regulations and policies that may affect the collective bargaining process.
              (3) Wages, salaries, and employee benefits. (i) Wages, salaries, and employee benefits shall be administered in a manner designated to adapt the normal practices and conditions of industry or institutions of higher education to the contract work, and to provide for appropriate review by DOE. Area practices, valid patterns, and well-established commercial or academic practices of the contractors, as appropriate, form the criteria for the establishment and adjustment of compensation schedules.
              (ii) The aspects of wages, hours, and working conditions which are the substance of collective bargaining in normal organized industries will be left to the orderly processes of negotiation and agreement between DOE contractor management and employee representatives with maximum possible freedom from Government interference.
              (4) Employee relations. The handling of employee relations on contract work, including such matters as the conduct and discipline of the work force and the handling of employee grievances, is part of the normal management responsibility of the contractor.
              (5) Collective bargaining. (i) DOE review of collective bargaining practices will be premised on the view that management's trusteeship for the operation of the Government facilities includes the duty to adopt practices which are fundamental to the friendly adjustment of disputes, and which experience has shown, promote orderly collective bargaining relationships. Practices inconsistent with this view may be objected to if not found to be otherwise clearly warranted.
              (ii) Consistent with the policy of assuring continuity of operation of vital facilities, all collective bargaining agreements at DOE-owned facilities should provide that grievances and disputes involving the interpretation or application of the agreement will be settled without resorting to strike, lockout, or other interruption of normal operations. For this purpose, each collective bargaining agreement entered into during the period of performance of this contract should provide an effective grievance procedure with arbitration as its final step, unless the parties mutually agree upon some other method of assuring continuity of operation for the term of the collective bargaining agreement.
              (iii) DOE expects its management and operating contractors and the unions representing the contractor's employees to cooperate fully with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
              (6) Personnel training. DOE encourages and supports personnel training programs aimed at improving work efficiency or developing needed skills which are not otherwise obtainable.
              (7) Working conditions. Accident, fire, health, and occupational hazards associated with DOE activities will be held to a practical minimum level and controlled in the interest of maintenance of health and prevention of accidents. Subject to DOE control, contractors shall be required to maintain comprehensive continuous preventive and protective programs appropriate to the particular activities throughout all operations. Appropriate financial protection in case of occupational disability must be provided to employees on DOE projects.
              (b) Title to payroll and associated records under certain contracts for the management and operation of DOE facilities, and for necessary miscellaneous construction incidental to the function of these facilities, shall vest in the Government. Such records are to be disposed of in accordance with DOE directions. For such contracts, the Solicitor of Labor has granted a tolerance from the Department of Labor Regulations to omit from the prescribed labor clauses the requirement for the retention of payrolls and associated records for a period of three years after completion of the contract. Under this tolerance, the records retention requirements for all labor clauses in the contract and the Fair Labor Standards Act are satisfied by disposal of such records in accordance with applicable DOE directives.

              Administrative controls and criteria for application of the Davis-Bacon Act in operational or maintenance activities.
              (a) Particular work items falling within one or more of the following criteria normally will be classified as non-covered by the Davis-Bacon Act, hereinafter referred to in this section as the “Act.”
              (1) Individual work items estimated to cost $2,000 or less. The total dollar amount of the management and operating contract is not a factor to be considered and bears no relation to individual work items classified as construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating. However, no item of work, the cost of which is estimated to be in excess of $2,000, shall be artificially divided into portions less than $2,000 for the purpose of avoiding the application of the Act.

              (2) Work and services that are a part of operational and maintenance activities or which, being very closely and directly involved therewith, are more in the nature of operational activities than construction, alteration, and/or repair work. This includes work and services which would involve a material risk to continuity of operations, to life or property, or to DOE operating requirements, if performed by persons other than the contractor's regular production and maintenance forces. However, any decision that contracts or work items are non-covered for these reasons must be made by the Head of the Contracting Activity without power of delegation.
              
              (3) Assembly, modification, setup, installation, replacement, removal, rearrangement, connection, testing, adjustment, and calibration of machinery and equipment. However, it is noted that these activities are covered if they are part of, or would be a logical part of, the construction of a facility, or if construction-type work which is not “incidental” to the overall effort is involved.
              (4) Experimental development of equipment, processes, or devices, including assembly, fitting, installation, testing, reworking, and disassembly. This refers to equipment, processes, and devices which are assembled for the purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The design may be only conceptual in character, and professional personnel who are responsible for the experiment participate in the assembly. Specifically excluded from the category of experimental development are buildings and building utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections thereto. Also specifically excluded from this category is equipment to be used for continuous testing (e.g., a machine to be continuously used for testing the tensile strength of structural members).
              (5) Experimental work in connection with peaceful uses of nuclear energy. This refers to equipment, processes and devices which are assembled and/or set in place and interconnected for the purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The nature of the test or experiment is such that professional personnel who are responsible for the test or experiment and/or data to be derived therefrom must, by necessity, participate in the assembly and interconnections. Specifically excluded from experimental work are buildings, building utility services, structural changes, drilling, tunneling, excavation, and back-filling work which can be performed according to customary drawings and specifications, and utility services of modifications to utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections thereto. Work in this category may be performed in mines or in other locations specifically constructed for tests or experiments.
              (6) Emergency work to combat the effects of fire, flood, earthquake, equipment failure, accident, or other casualties, and to restart the operational activity following the casualty. Work which is not directly related to restarting the activity or which involves rebuilding or replacement of a structure, structural components, or equipment is excluded from this category.
              (7) Decontamination, including washing, scrubbing, and scraping to remove contamination; removal of contaminated soil or other material; and painting or other resurfacing, provided that such painting or resurfacing is an integral part of the decontamination activity and performed by the employees of the contractors performing the decontamination.
              (8) Burial of contaminated soil waste or contained liquid; however, initial preparatory work readying the burial ground for use (e.g., any grading or excavating that is a part of initial site preparation, fencing, drilling wells for continued monitoring of contamination, construction of guard or other office space) is covered. Work performed subsequent to burial which involves the placement of concrete or other like activity is also covered.
              (b) The classification of a contract as a contract for operational or maintenance activities does not necessarily mean that all work and activities at the contract location are classifiable as outside coverage of the Act since it may be necessary to separate work which should be classified as covered. Therefore, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall establish and maintain controls for the careful scrutiny of proposed work assignments under such contracts to assure that:
              (1) Contractors whose contracts do not contemplate the performance of work covered by the Act with the contractor's own forces are neither asked nor authorized to perform work within the scope of the Act. If the actual work assignments do involve covered work, the contract should be modified to include applicable provisions of the Act.

              (2) Where covered work is performed by a contractor whose contract contains provisions required by the Act, such work is performed as required by law and the contract. After the contractor has been informed, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this subsection, that certain work is covered, the responsibilities of the Head of the Contracting Activity to assure compliance is the same as it would be if the work were being performed under a separate construction contract.
              (3) Controls provided for above include consideration by the Head of the Contracting Activity and the contractor, before work is begun or contracted out, of the relation of the Act to the annual programming of work; the contractor's work orders; and work contracted out in excess of $2,000. The Head of the Contracting Activity may, if consistent with DOE's responsibilities as described in this subsection, prescribe from time to time classes of work as to which applicability or nonapplicability of the Act is clear, for which the Head of the Contracting Activity will require no further DOE determination on coverage in advance of the work. For all work, controls to be established by the Head of the Contracting Activity should provide for notification to the contractor before work is begun as to whether such work is covered. The Head of the Contracting Activity is responsible for submitting to the Wage and Hours Division, Employment Standards Administration, Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. 20210, all DOE requests for project area or installation wage determinations, or individual determinations, or extensions or modification thereto. Requests for such determinations shall be made on Standard Form 308, at least 30 calendar days before they are required for use in advertising for bids or requests for proposals.
              (c) Experimental installations. Within DOE programs, a variety of experiments are conducted involving materials, fuels, coolants, and processing equipment. Certain types of situations where tests and experiments have presented coverage questions are described as follows:
              (1) Set-ups of device and/or processes. The proving out of investigative findings and theories of a scientific and technical nature may require the set-up of various devices and/or processes at an early, pre-prototype stage of development. These may range from laboratory bench size to much larger set-ups. As a rule, these set-ups are made within established facilities (normally laboratories), required utility connections are made to services provided as a part of the basic facilities, and the activity as a whole falls within the functional purpose of the facility. Such set-ups are generally not covered. However, the erection of structures which are public works is covered if construction type work, other than incidental work, is involved. Preparatory work for the set-up requiring structural changes or modifications of basic utility services, as distinguished from connections thereto, is covered. The following are illustrations of non-covered set-ups of devices and/or processes:
              (i) Assembly of piping and equipment within existing “hot cell” facilities for proving out a conceptual design of a chemical processing unit.
              (ii) Assembly of equipment, including adaptation and modification thereof, in existing “hot cell” facilities to prove out a conceptual design for remotely controlled machining equipment.
              (iii) Assembly of the first graphite pile in a stadium at Stagg Field in Chicago.
              (iv) Assembly of materials and equipment for particular aspects of the direct current thermonuclear experiments to explore feasibility and to study other ramifications of the concept of high energy injection and to collect data thereon.
              (2) Loops. Many experiments are carried on in equipment assemblies, called loops, in which liquids or gases are circulated under monitored and controlled conditions. For purposes of determining coverage under the Act, loops may be classed as loop facilities or as loop set-ups. Both of these classes of loops can include in-reactor loops and out-of-reactor loops. In differentiating between clearly identified loop set-ups and loop facilities, an area exists in which there have been some questions of coverage, such as certain loops at the Material Test Reactor and at Engineering Test Reactor and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory site. Upon clarification of this area, further illustrations will be added. In the meantime, the differentiation between loop set-ups and loop facilities must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the total criteria set forth in this subpart.
              (i) Loop set-ups. The assembly, erection, modification, and disassembly of a loop set-up is non-covered. A noncontroversial example of a loop set-up is one which is assembled in a laboratory, e.g., Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, or Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for a particular test and thereafter disassembled. However, preparatory work for a loop set-up requiring structural changes or modifications of basic utility services as distinguished from connections thereto is covered, as are material and equipment that are installed for a loop set-up which is a permanent part of the facility or which is use for a succession of experimental programs.
              (ii) Loop facilities. A loop facility differs from a loop set-up in that it is of a more permanent character. It is usually, but not always, of greater size. It normally involves the building or modification of a structure. Sometimes it is installed as a part of construction of the facility. It may be designed for use in a succession of experimental programs over a longer period of time. Examples of loop facilities are the in-reactor “K” loops at Hanford and the large Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion loop at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory site. The on-site assembly and erection of such loop facilities are covered. However, once a loop facility is completed and becomes operational, the criteria set forth in this paragraph for operational and maintenance activities apply.
              (3) Reactor component experiments. Other experiments are carried on by insertion of experimental components within reactor systems without the use of a loop assembly. An example of reactor facilities erected for such experimental purposes are the special power excursion test reactors (SPETRs) at the National Reactor Test Site which are designed for studying reactor behavior and performance characteristics of certain reactor components. Such a facility may consist of a reactor vessel, pressurizing tank, coolant loops, pumps, heat exchangers, and other auxiliary equipment as needed. The facility also may include sufficient shielding to permit work on the reactor to proceed following a short period of power interruption, and buildings as needed to house the reactor and its auxiliary equipment. The erection and on-site assembly of such a reactor facility is covered, but the components whose characteristics are under study are excluded from coverage. To illustrate, one of the SPETRs planned for studies of nuclear reactor safety is designed to accommodate various internal fuel and control assemblies. The internal structure of the pressure vessel is designed so that cores of different shapes and sizes may be placed in the vessel for investigation, or the entire internal structure may be easily removed and replaced by a structure which will accept a different core design. Similarly, the control rod assembly is arranged to provide for flexibility in the removal of instrument leads and experimental assemblies from within the core.
              (4) Tests or experiments in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. These tests or experiments are varied in nature and some are only in a planning stage. They consist of one or more nuclear or nonnuclear detonations for the purposes of acquiring data. The data can include seismic effects, radiation effects, amount of heat generated, amount of material moved and so forth. Some of these tests are conducted in existing mines, while others are conducted in facilities specifically constructed for the tests or experiments. In general, all work which can be performed in accordance with customary drawings and specifications, as well as other work in connection with preparation of facilities is treated as covered work. Such work includes tunneling, drilling, excavation and back-filling, erection of buildings or other structures, and installation of utilities. The installation of the nonnuclear material or nuclear device to be detonated, and the instrumentation and connection between such material or device and the instrumentation are treated as non-covered work.
              (5) Tests or experiments in military uses of nuclear energy. As in 970.2204-1-1(c)(4), these tests or experiments can be varied in nature. However, under this category it is intended to include only detonation of nonnuclear material or nuclear devices. The material or devices can be detonated either underground, at ground level, or above the ground. These tests or experiments have been conducted in, on, or in connection with facilities specifically constructed for such tests or experiments. As in tests or experiments in peaceful uses of nuclear energy, all work which can be performed in accord with customary drawings and specifications, as well as other work in connection with preparation of facilities are treated as covered work. Such work includes building towers or similar structures, tunneling, drilling, excavation and backfilling, erection of buildings or other structures, and installation of utilities. The installation of the nonnuclear material or nuclear devices and instrumentation are treated as non-covered work.
              (d) Construction site contiguous to an established manufacturing facility. As DOE-owned property sometimes encompasses several thousand acres of real estate, a number of separate facilities may be located in areas contiguous to each other on the same property. These facilities may be built over a period of years, and established manufacturing activities may be regularly carried on at one site at the same time that construction of another facility is underway at another site. On occasion, the regular manufacturing activities of the operating contractor at the first site may include the manufacture, assembly, and reconditioning of components and equipment which in other industries would normally be done in established commercial plants. While the manufacture of components and equipment in the manufacturing plant is non-covered, the installation of any such manufactured items on a construction job is covered.

              970.2270
              Unemployment compensation.
              (a) Each state has its own unemployment compensation system to provide payments to workers who become unemployed involuntarily and through no fault of their own. Funds are provided for unemployment compensation benefits through a payroll tax on employers. Most DOE contractors are subject to the unemployment compensation tax laws of the states in which they are located. It is the policy to assure, both in the negotiation and administration of cost-reimbursement type contracts, that economical and practical arrangements are made and practiced with respect to unemployment compensation.
              (b) Contract exempt from state laws. (1) Some contractors are exempt from state unemployment compensation laws, usually on grounds that they are nonprofit organizations or subdivisions of State governments. Most states, however, permit such employers to elect unemployment compensation coverage on a voluntary basis. Under such circumstances, all existing or prospective cost-reimbursement contractors shall be encouraged to provide unemployment compensation coverage or equivalent substitutes.

              (2) It is also DOE policy that, prior to the award or extension of a management and operating contract, exempt contractors or prospective contractors shall be required to submit to the contracting officer a statement that they will either elect coverage or provide equivalent substitutes for unemployment compensation, or in the alternative, submit evidence that it is impractical to do so. If any exempt contractor or prospective contractor submits that it is impractical to elect coverage or to provide an equivalent substitute, appropriate Office of Contract and Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, staff shall review that position prior to recommending an award or extension of the contract. If there are substantial reasons for not electing coverage or for not providing equivalent substitutes, a contract may be awarded or extended. Headquarters' staff review and recommendation shall be based on such factors as—
              (i) The specific provisions of the unemployment compensation law of the State;
              (ii) The extent to which the establishment of special conditions on DOE work may have an adverse effect on the contractor's general policies and operating costs in its private operations;
              (iii) The numerical relationship between the contractor's private work force and its employees performing only work for DOE;
              (iv) The contractor's record with respect to work force stability and the general outlook with respect to future work force stability;
              (v) In a replacement contractor situation, whether or not the prior contractor had coverage or suitable substitutes; and
              (vi) The particular labor relations implications involved.

              (a) The Department of Energy regulates the nuclear safety of its major facilities under its own statutory authority derived from the Atomic Energy Act and other legislation. The Department also regulates, under certain specific conditions, the use by its contractors of radioactive materials and ionizing radiation producing machines.
              (b) The inclusion of environmental, safety and health clauses in DOE contracts shall be made by the contracting officer in accordance with this subpart and in consultation with appropriate environmental, safety and health program management personnel.
              (c)(1) For DOE management and operating contracts and other contracts designated by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, the clause entitled “970.5215-3 Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts” implements the requirements of section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act for the use of a contract clause that provides for an appropriate reduction in the fee or amount paid to the contractor under the contract in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any Departmental regulation relating to the enforcement of worker safety and health concerns. The clause, in part, provides for reductions in the amount of fee, profit, or share of cost savings that is otherwise earned by the contractor for performance failures relating to worker safety and health violations under the Department's regulations.
              (2)(i) Section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act states that DOE shall either pursue civil penalties (implemented at 10 CFR part 851) for a violation under section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2282c) or a contract fee reduction, but not both.
              (ii) The contracting officer must coordinate with the Office of Price Anderson Enforcement within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Safety and Security (or with any designated successor office) before pursuing contract fee reduction in the event of a violation by the contractor or any contractor employee of any Departmental regulation relating to the enforcement of worker safety and health concerns.

              970.2703-1
              Purposes of patent rights clauses.
              (a) DOE sites and facilities are managed and operated on behalf of the Department of Energy by a contractor, pursuant to management and operating contracts that are generally awarded for a five (5) year term, with the possibility for renewal. Special provisions relating to patent rights are appropriately incorporated into an M&O contract because of the unique circumstances and responsibilities of managing and operating a Government-owned facility, as compared to other federally funded research and development contracts.
              (b)(1) Technology transfer mission clause. In accordance with Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), DOE may grant technology transfer authority to M&O contractors operating a DOE facility. Generally, M&O contractors have the right to elect to retain title to inventions made under the contract, whether a nonprofit or educational organizations, as a result of 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq. (Bayh-Dole Act), or a large business, as a result of a class patent waiver issued pursuant to 10 CFR part 784. Under such contracts, the M&O contractor assumes responsibilities for commercializing retained inventions, in accordance with the Technology Transfer Mission clause provided at 970.5227-3. That clause also governs such activities as the distribution of royalties earned from inventions made under the contract and the transfer of patent rights in inventions made under the contract to successor contractors.

              (2) If the M&O contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business firm having technology transfer authority, the following clauses are inserted into the M&O contract: 970.5227-3 and 970.5227-10.
              (3) If the M&O contract has technology transfer as a mission and is to be performed by a for-profit, large business firm that has been granted an advance class waiver, the following clauses are inserted into the M&O contract: 970.5227-3 and 970.5227-12. The terms of the clause at 970.5227-12 are subject to modification to conform to the terms of the class waiver.
              (4) If the M&O contract does not have a technology transfer mission and is to be performed by a for-profit, large business firm and does not have advance class waiver under 10 CFR part 784, the patent rights clause at 970.5227-11 is inserted into the M&O contract, and the Technology Transfer Mission clause is inapplicable.
              (5) If the contractor is an educational institution, a non-profit organization or a small business firm and is conducting privately funded technology transfer activities, involving the use of private funds to conduct licensing and marketing activities related to inventions made under the contract in accordance with the Bayh-Dole Act, DOE may modify the patent rights clause (970.5227-10) to address issues such as the disposition of royalties earned under the privately funded technology transfer program, the transfer of patent rights to a successor contractor, allowable cost restrictions concerning privately funded technology transfer activities, and the Government's freedom from any liability related to licensing under the contractor's privately funded technology transfer program.
              (c) Contracting officers must consult with DOE patent counsel assisting the contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in selecting for use in the solicitation, negotiating, or approving appropriate patent rights clauses for a M&O contract. It may be appropriate to include more than one patent rights clause in a solicitation if the successful contractor could, for instance, be either an educational or a large business. If a large business may be selected for performance of a contract that will include a technology transfer clause, the solicitation must include the clause at 970.5227-12 to reflect the waiver that will likely be granted. If the solicitation includes more than one patent clause, it must include an explanation of the circumstances under which the appropriate clause will be used. The final award must contain only one patent rights clause.
            
            
              970.2703-2
              Patent rights clause provisions for management and operating contractors.
              (a) Allocation of Principal Rights: Bayh-Dole provisions. If the management and operating contractor is an educational institution or nonprofit organization, the patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-10 must be inserted into the M&O contract. Such entities are beneficiaries of Bayh-Dole Act, including the paramount right of the contractor to elect to retain title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance of work under the contract, except in DOE-exempted areas of technology or in operation of DOE facilities primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs.
              (b) Allocation of Principal Rights: Government title. (1) The patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-11 must be incorporated into the M&O contract if the contractor is a for-profit, large business firm and the contract does not have a technology transfer mission or if, without regard to the type of contractor, the contract is for the operation of a DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs. That clause provides for DOE's statutory obligation to take title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under an M&O contract, and does not contemplate an advance class waiver of Government rights in inventions, or participation by the contractor in technology transfer activities.

              (2) While only in rare circumstances does a for-profit large business contractor whose contract contains no technology transfer mission receive rights in or title to inventions made under the contract, the contractor does have the right to request a license or foreign patent rights in inventions made under the contract, and may petition for a waiver of Government rights in identified inventions. The patent rights clause 970.5227-11 does not include many of the provisions of patent rights clauses 970.5227-10 and 970.5227-12, related to the filing of patent applications by the contractor, the granting of rights in inventions by the contractor to third parties (preference for United States industry), and conditions allowing the Government to grant licenses to third parties in inventions retained by the contractor (march-in rights). Any instrument granting rights in inventions made under a contract governed by patent rights clause 970.5227-11 must include these additional provisions within its terms and conditions.
              (c) Allocation of Principal Rights: Contractor right to elect title under an advance class waiver. If the M&O contractor is a for-profit, large business firm and the Government has granted an advance class waiver of Government rights in inventions made in the course of or under the M&O contract, under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2182) and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5908(c)), the patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-12 must be inserted into the M&O contract, unless the terms and conditions of such an approved waiver alter or replace the patent rights clause provisions pursuant to 10 CFR part 784.
              (d) Extensions of time—DOE discretion. The patent rights clauses for M&O contracts require the contractor to take certain actions within prescribed time periods to comply with the contract and preserve its rights in inventions. The M&O contractor may request extensions of time in which to take such actions by submitting written justification to DOE, and DOE may grant the contractor's requests, on a case-by-case basis. If the time period expired due to negligence by the contractor, DOE may grant a request for an extension of time upon a showing by the contractor that corrective procedures are in place to avoid such negligence in the future. If a contractor is requesting an extension of time in which to elect to retain title to an invention, DOE may grant the request if the extension allows the contractor to conduct further experimentation, market research, or other analysis helpful to determine contractor interest in electing title to the invention, among other considerations. Generally, the extensions of time are for periods of between six (6) months to one (1) year.
              (e) Facilities license. These include the rights to make, use, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all articles, materials, products, or processes embodying inventions or discoveries used or embodied in the facility regardless of whether or not conceived or first actually reduced to practice under or in the course of such a contract. The patent rights clauses, 970.5227-10, 970.5227-11, 970.5227-12, each contain a provision granting the Government this facilities license.
              (f) Deletion of classified inventions provision. If DOE determines that the research, development, demonstration or production work to be performed during the course of a management and operating contract most probably will not involve classified subject matter or result in any inventions that require security classification, DOE patent counsel may advise the contracting officer to delete the patent rights clause provision entitled, “Classified Inventions” from the M&O contract.
              (g) Alternate 1—Weapons Related Research or Production. If DOE grants technology transfer authority to a DOE facility, pursuant to Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), and the DOE owned facility is involved in weapons related research and development, or production, then Alternate 1 of the patent rights clauses must be inserted into the M&O contract. Alternate 1 defines weapons related subject inventions and restricts the contractor's rights with respect to such inventions.
            
            
              970.2704
              Rights in data.
            
            
              970.2704-1
              General.

              (a) Rights in data relating to the performance of the contract and to all facilities are significant in assuring continuity of the management and operation of DOE facilities. It is crucial in assuring DOE's continuing ability to perform its statutory missions that DOE obtain rights to all data produced or specifically used by its management and operating contractors and appropriate subcontractors. In order to obtain the necessary rights in technical data, DOE contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contracts contain either the Rights in Data clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, or the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer. Selection of the appropriate clause is dependent upon whether technology transfer is a mission of the management and operating contract pursuant to the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 et seq., as amended). If technology transfer is not a mission of the management and operating contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, shall be used. In those instances in which technology transfer is a mission of the contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, shall be used.
              (b) Employees of the management and operating contractor may not be used to assist in the preparation of a proposal or bid for services which are similar or related to those being performed under the contract, which are to be performed by the contractor or its parent or affiliate organization for commercial customers unless the employee has been separated from work under the DOE contract for such period as the Head of the Contracting Activity or designee shall have directed.
            
            
              970.2704-2
              Procedures.
              (a) The clauses at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data-Facilities, and 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, both provide generally for Government ownership and for unlimited rights in the Government for all data first produced in the performance of the contract and unlimited rights in data specifically used in the performance of the contract. Both clauses provide that, subject to patent, security, and other provisions of the contract, the contractor may use contract data for its private purposes. The contractor, under either clause, must treat any data furnished by DOE or acquired from other Government agencies or private entities in the performance of their contracts in accordance with any restrictive legends contained therein.
              (b) Since both clauses secure access to and, if requested, delivery of technical data used in the performance of the contract, there is generally no need to use the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in the management and operating contract.
              (c)(1) Paragraph (d) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and paragraph (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provide for the inclusion in subcontracts of the Rights in Technical Data—General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, with Alternate V, and modified in accordance with DEAR 927.409. Those clauses also provide for the inclusion in appropriate subcontracts Alternates II, III, and IV to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14 with DOE's prior approval and the inclusion of the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in all subcontracts for research, development, or demonstration and all other subcontracts having special requirements for the production or delivery of data. In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated by the contractor under its contract with DOE, the management and operating contractor shall use the Rights in Data—Facilities clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1.

              (2) Where, however, a subcontract is to be awarded by the management and operating contractor in connection with a program, as discussed at 927.404-70, which provides statutory authority to protect from public disclosure, data first produced under contracts awarded pursuant to the program, contracting officers shall ensure that the management and operating contractor includes in that subcontract the rights in data clause provided by DOE Patent Counsel, consistent with any accompanying guidance.
              
              (3) Management and operating contractors and higher-tier subcontractors shall not use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use, nor may they acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software except through the use of Alternate II or III to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, respectively, without the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel.
              (d)(1) Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, and paragraphs (g) and (h) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provide for the contractor's granting a nonexclusive license in any limited rights data and restricted computer software specifically used in performance of the contract.
              (2) In certain instances the objectives of DOE would be frustrated if the Government did not obtain, at the time of contracting, limited license rights on behalf of responsible third parties and the Government, and to limited rights data or restricted computer software or both necessary for the practice of subject inventions or data first produced or delivered in the performance of the contract. This situation may arise in the performance of management and operating contracts and contracts for the management or operation of a DOE facility or site. Contracting officers should consult with program officials and Patent Counsel. No such rights should be obtained from a small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in background inventions of the small business or non-profit organization have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). Where such a background license is in DOE's interest, a provision that provides substantially as Alternate VI at 48 CFR 952.227-14 should be added to the appropriate clause, 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, or 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer.
              (e) The Rights in Data—Technology Transfer clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2 differs from the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data—Facilities, in the context of its more detailed treatment of copyright. In management and operating contracts that have technology transfer as a mission, the right to assert copyright in data first produced under the contract will be a valuable right, and commercialization of such data, including computer software, will assist the management and operating contractor in advancing the technology transfer mission of the contract. The clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, provides for DOE approval of DOE's taking a limited copyright license for a period of five years, and, in certain rare cases, specified longer periods in order to contribute to commercialization of the data.
              (f) Contracting officers should consult with Patent Counsel to assure that requirements regarding royalties and conflicts of interest associated with asserting copyright in data first produced under the contract are appropriately addressed in the Technology Transfer Mission clause (48 CFR 970.5227-3) of the management and operating contract. Where it is not otherwise clear which DOE program funded the development of a computer software package, such as where the development was funded out of a contractor's overhead account, the DOE program which was the primary source of funding for the entire contract is deemed to have administrative responsibility. This issue may arise, among others, in the decision whether to grant the contractor permission to assert copyright. See paragraph (e) of the Rights in Data—Technology Transfer clause at 970.5227-2.
              (g) In management and operating contracts involving access to DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related restricted data and technology. Alternate I to each clause shall be used where access to Category C-24 restricted data is contemplated in the performance of a contract.

The contracting officer shall include the clause with its Alternate I in contracts where access to Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, is to be provided to contractors.
              (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-2, Rights in Data—Technology Transfer, in management and operating contracts which contain the clause at 970.5227-3, Technology Transfer Mission. The contracting officer shall include the clause with its Alternate I in contracts where access to Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, is to be provided to contractors.

              General.

              This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementing the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 et seq., as amended). The Act requires that technology transfer be established as a mission of each Government-owned laboratory operated under contract by a non-Federal entity. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 expanded the definition of “laboratory” to include weapon production facilities that are operated for national security purposes and are engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a nuclear weapon or its components.
            
            
              970.2770-2
              Policy.

              All new awards for or extensions of existing DOE laboratory or weapon production facility management and operating contracts shall have technology transfer, including authorization to award Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), as a laboratory or facility mission under Section 11(a)(1) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, Public Law 96-480 (15 U.S.C. 3701 et seq., as amended). A management and operating contractor for a facility not deemed to be a laboratory or weapon production facility may be authorized on a case-by-case basis to support the DOE technology transfer mission including, but not limited to, participating in CRADAs awarded by DOE laboratories and weapon production facilities.
            
            
              970.2770-3
              Technology transfer and patent rights.
              The National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 (NCTTA) established technology transfer as a mission for Government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories, including weapons production facilities, and authorizes those laboratories to negotiate and award cooperative research and development agreements with public and private entities for purposes of conducting research and development and transferring technology to the private sector. In implementing the NCTTA, DOE has negotiated technology transfer clauses with the contractors managing and operating its laboratories. Those technology transfer clauses must be read in concert with the patent rights clause required by this subpart. Thus, each management and operating contractor holds title to subject inventions for the benefit of the laboratory or facility being managed and operated by that contractor.
            
            
              970.2770-4
              Contract clause.
              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-3, Technology Transfer Mission, in each solicitation for a new or an extension of an existing laboratory or weapon production facility management and operating contract.

              (b) If the contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business eligible under 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq., to receive title to any inventions under the contract and proposes to fund at private expense the maintaining, licensing, and marketing of the inventions, the contracting officer shall use the basic clause with its Alternate I.
              (c) If the facility is operated for national security purposes and engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a nuclear weapon or its components, the contracting officer shall use the basic clause with its Alternate II.
            
          
          
            
            Subpart 970.28—Bonds and Insurance

              Insurance.
            
            
              970.2803-1
              Workers' Compensation Insurance.
              (a) Policies and requirements. (1) Workers' compensation insurance protects employers against liability imposed by workers' compensation laws for injury or death to employees arising out of, or in the course of, their employment. This type of insurance is required by state laws unless employers have acceptable programs of self-insurance.
              (2) Special requirements. Certain workers' compensation laws contain provisions which result in limiting the protection afforded persons subject to such laws. The policy with respect to these limitations as they affect persons employed by management and operating contractors is set forth as follows:
              (i) Elective provisions. Some worker's compensation laws permit an employer to elect not to be subject to its provisions. It is DOE policy to require these contractors to be subject to workers' compensation laws in jurisdictions permitting election.
              (ii) Statutory immunity. Under the provisions of some workers' compensation laws, certain types of employers; e.g., nonprofit educational institutions, are relieved from liability. If a contractor has a statutory option to accept liability, it is DOE policy to require the contractor to do so.
              (iii) Limited medical benefits. Some workers' compensation laws limit the liability of the employer for medical care to a maximum dollar amount or to a specified period of time. In such cases, a contractor's workers' compensation insurance policy should contain a standard extra-statutory medical coverage endorsement.
              (iv) Limits on occupational disease coverage and employers' liability. Some workers' compensation laws do not provide coverage for all occupational diseases. In such situations, a contractor's workers' compensation insurance policy should contain voluntary coverage for all occupational diseases.
              (3) Contractor “employees' benefit plan”—self-insurers. The policies and requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply where management and operating contractors purchase workers' compensation insurance. With respect to self-insured contractors, the objectives specified in paragraph (a)(2) also shall be met through primary or excess workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance policy(ies) or an approved combination thereof. “Employees” benefit plans” which were established in prior years may be continued to contrast termination at existing benefit levels.
              (b) Assignment of responsibilities. (1) Office of Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, other officials, and the Heads of Contracting Activities, consistent with their delegations of responsibility, shall assure management and operating contracts are consistent with the policies and requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
              (2) In discharging assigned responsibility, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall—
              (i) Periodically review workers' compensation insurance programs of management and operating contractors in the light of applicable workers' compensation statutes to assure conformance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
              (ii) Evaluate the adequacy of coverage of “self-insured” workers” compensation programs;
              (iii) Provide arrangements for the administration of any existing “employees” benefit plans until such plans” are terminated; and
              (iv) Submit to the Office of Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, all proposals for the modification of existing “employees' benefit plans.”
              (3) The Office of Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, is responsible for approving management and operating contractor “employees' benefit plans.”

              970.2803-2
              Contract clause.

              The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5228-1, Insurance—Litigation and Claims, instead of the clause at 48 CFR 52.228-7, in all management and operating contracts. Paragraphs (f)(3)(C) and (g)(2) of that clause apply to a nonprofit contractor only to the extent specifically provided in the individual contract.

              Other Federal tax exemptions.
              (a) The exemption respecting taxes on communication services or facilities has been held to extend to such services when furnished to Department of Energy (DOE) management and operating contractors who pay for such services or facilities from advances made to them by DOE under their contracts.
              (c) Where it is considered that a request for an additional exemption in the performance of a management and operating contract would be justified, a recommendation that such a request be made should be forwarded to the Chief Financial Officer, Headquarters.
              (d) Where tax exemption certificates are required in connection with the taxes cited in this section, the Head of the Contracting Activity will supply standard Government forms (SF 1094, U.S. Tax Exemption Certificate) on request.

              Application of State and local taxes to the Government.
              It is DOE policy to secure those immunities or exemptions from state and local taxes to which it is entitled under the Federal Constitution or state laws. In carrying out this policy, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall—
              (a) Take all necessary steps to preclude payment of any taxes for which any of the immunities or exemptions cited in this subpart are available. Advice of Counsel should be sought as to the availability of such immunities or exemptions; and
              (b) Acquire directly and furnish to contractors as Government furnished property, equipment, material, or services when, in the opinion of the Head of the Contracting Activity—
              (1) Such direct acquisition will result in substantial savings to the Government, taking into consideration any additional administrative costs;
              (2) Such direct acquisition will not have a substantial adverse effect on the relationship between DOE and its contractor; and
              (3) Such direct acquisition will not have a substantial adverse effect on the DOE program or schedules.

              970.3102-3-70
              Home office expenses.
              (a) For on-site work, DOE's fee for management and operating contracts, determined under the policy of and calculated per the procedures in 970.1504-1-3, generally provides adequate compensation for home or corporate office general and administrative expenses incurred in the general management of the contractor's business as a whole.
              (1) DOE recognizes that some Home Office Expenses are incurred for the benefit of a management and operating contract. DOE has elected to recognize that benefit through fee due to the difficulty of determining the dollar value applicable to any management and operating contract. The difficulty arises because:
              (i) The general construct of a management and operating contract results in minimal Home Office involvement in the contract work, and
              (ii) Conventional Home Office Expense allocation techniques that use bases such as total operating costs, labor dollars, hours etc., are not appropriate because they inherently assume significant contractor investment (in terms of its own resources, such as, labor, material, overhead, etc.). Contractor investments are minimal under DOE's operating and management contracts. The contracts are totally financed by DOE advance payments, and DOE provides government-owned facilities, property, and other needed resources.
              (2) From time to time, the fee for a management and operating contract may not be adequate compensation for Home Office Expenses incurred for the benefit of the contract. An indication that such a case exists is the need for significant home office support to deal with issues at the site that occur without the fault or negligence of the contractor, for example, the need for home office legal support to deal with third party, environmental, safety, or health issues.
              (3) In such a case, the contracting officer, after obtaining the HCA's approval, may consider a contractor request for additional compensation. The contractor may request—
              (i) Fee in addition to its normal fee (but see 970.1504-1-3(b)(1) if the contract is for the management and operation of a laboratory); or
              (ii) Compensation on the basis of actual cost.
              (4) Because the contract's fee provides some compensation for Home Office Expenses, the contractor's request for additional compensation must always be for an amount less than the Home Office Expenses that are incurred for the benefit of the management and operating contract.

              (b) For off-site work, the DOE allows Home Office Expenses under architect-engineer, supply and research contracts with commercial contractors performing the work in their own facilities. Home Office Expenses may, however, be included for reimbursement under such DOE off-site architect-engineer, supply and research contracts, only to the extent that they are determined, after careful examination, to be allowable, reasonable, and properly allocable to the work. Work performed in a contractor's own facilities under a management and operating or construction contract may likewise be allowed to bear the properly allocable portion of allowable Home Office Expenses.

              Compensation for personal services.
              (a)(6) In determining the reasonableness of compensation, the compensation of each individual contractor employee normally need not be subjected to review and approval. Generally, the compensation paid individual employees should be left to the judgment of contractors subject to the limitations of DOE-approved compensation policies, programs, classification systems, and schedules, and amounts of money authorized for wage and salary increases for groups of employees. However, the contracting officer shall designate a compensation threshold appropriate for the particular situation. The contract shall specifically provide that contracting officer approval is required for compensating an individual contractor employee above the threshold if a total of 50 percent or more of such compensation is reimbursed under DOE cost-type contracts. For purposes of designating the threshold, total compensation includes only the employee's salary and cash bonus or incentive compensation.
              (7)(i) Reimbursable costs for compensation for personal services are to be set forth in the contract. This compensation shall be set forth using the principles and policies of 48 CFR 31.205-6, Compensation, as supplemented by this section, 970.3102-05-6, and other pertinent parts of the DEAR. Costs that are unallowable under other contract terms shall not be allowable as compensation for personnel services.
              (ii) The contract sets forth, in detail, personnel costs and related expenses allowable under the contract and documents personnel policies, practices and plans which have been found acceptable by the contracting officer. The contractor will advise DOE of any proposed changes in any matters covered by these policies, practices, or plans which relate to personnel costs. Types of personnel costs and related expenses addressed in the contract are as follows: Salaries and wages; bonuses and incentive compensation; overtime, shift differential, holiday, and other premium pay for time worked; welfare benefits and retirement programs; paid time off, and salaries and wages to employees in their capacity as union stewards and committeemen for time spent in handling grievances, or serving on labor management (contractor) committees provided, however, that the contracting officer's approval is required in each instance of total compensation to an individual employee above an annual rate as specified in the contract.
              (p)(1) Notwithstanding the costs cited in this subsection, incurred for compensation of a senior executive in excess of the benchmark compensation amount determined applicable for the contractor fiscal year by the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, are unallowable. Allowable costs of executive compensation shall be determined pursuant to 48 CFR 31.205-6(p).

              (a) Costs for transportation, lodging, meals, and incidental expenses. (1) Costs incurred by contractor personnel on official company business are allowable, subject to the limitations contained in this subsection. Costs for transportation may be based on mileage rates, actual costs incurred, or on a combination thereof, provided the method used results in a reasonable charge. Costs for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses may be based on per diem, actual expenses, or a combination thereof, provided the method used results in a reasonable charge.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection, costs incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses (as defined in the regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this subsection) shall be considered to be reasonable and allowable only to the extent that they do not exceed on a daily basis the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the—
              (i) Federal Travel Regulation, prescribed by the General Services Administration (41 CFR chapters 300 through 304), for travel in the conterminous 48 United States, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 922-002-00000-2;
              (ii) Joint Travel Regulations, DoD Civilian Personnel, Appendix A, prescribed by the Department of Defense, for travel in Alaska, Hawaii, The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories and possessions of the United States, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 908-010-00000-1; or
              (iii) Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), section 925, “Maximum Travel Per Diem Allowances for Foreign Areas,” prescribed by the Department of State, for travel in areas not covered in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 744-008-00000-0.
              (3) In special or unusual situations, actual costs in excess of the maximum per diem rates are allowable provided that such amounts do not exceed the higher amounts authorized for Federal civilian employees as permitted in the regulations referenced in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection. For such higher amounts to be allowable, all of the following conditions must be met:
              (i) One of the conditions warranting approval of the actual expense method, as set forth in the regulations referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, must exist.
              (ii) A written justification for use of the higher amounts must be approved by an officer of the contractor's organization or designee to ensure that the authority is properly administered and controlled to prevent abuse.
              (iii) If it becomes necessary to exercise the authority to use the higher actual expense method repetitively or on a continuing basis in a particular area, the contractor must obtain advance approval from the contracting officer.
              (iv) Documentation to support actual costs incurred shall be in accordance with the contractor's established practices, subject to paragraph (a)(7) of this subsection, and provided that a receipt is required for each expenditure of $75.00 or more. The approved justification required by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) and, if applicable, paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this subsection must be retained.
              (4) Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this subsection do not incorporate the regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this subsection in their entirety. Only the maximum per diem rates, the definitions of lodging, meals, and incidental expenses, and the regulatory coverage dealing with special or unusual situations are incorporated in this subsection.

              (5) An advance agreement (see 48 CFR 31.109 and 970.3101-9) with respect to compliance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this subsection may be useful and desirable.
              (6)(i) The maximum per diem rates referenced in paragraph (a)(2) of this subsection generally would not constitute a reasonable daily charge—
              (A) When no lodging costs are incurred; and/or
              (B) On partial travel days (e.g., day of departure and return).
              (ii) Appropriate downward adjustments from the maximum per diem rates would normally be required under these circumstances. While these adjustments need not be calculated in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation or Joint Travel Regulations, they must result in a reasonable charge.
              (7) Costs shall be allowable only if the following information is documented:
              (i) Date and place (city, town, or other similar designation) of the expenses;
              (ii) Purpose of the trip; and
              (iii) Name of person on trip and that person's title or relationship to the contractor.
              (b) Travel costs incurred in the normal course of overall administration of the business are allowable and shall be treated as indirect costs.
              (c) Travel costs directly attributable to specific contract performance are allowable and may be charged to the contract under 48 CFR 31.202.
              (d) Airfare costs in excess of the lowest customary standard, coach, or equivalent airfare offered during normal business hours are unallowable except when such accommodations require circuitous routing, require travel during unreasonable hours, excessively prolong travel, result in increased cost that would offset transportation savings, are not reasonably adequate for the physical or medical needs of the traveler, or are not reasonably available to meet mission requirements. However, in order for airfare costs in excess of the standard airfare to be allowable, the applicable condition(s) must be documented and justified.
              (e)(1) “Cost of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft,” as used in this paragraph, includes the cost of lease, charter, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs.
              (2) The costs of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft are limited to the standard airfare described in paragraph (d) of this subsection for the flight destination unless travel by such aircraft is specifically required by contract specification, term, or condition, or a higher amount is approved by the contracting officer. A higher amount may be agreed to when one or more of the circumstances for justifying higher than standard airfare listed in paragraph (d) of this subsection are applicable, or when an advance agreement under paragraph (e)(3) of this subsection has been executed. In all cases, travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft must be fully documented and justified. For each contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft used for any business purpose which is charged or allocated, directly or indirectly, to a Government contract, the contractor must maintain and make available manifest/logs for all flights on such company aircraft. As a minimum, the manifest/log shall indicate—
              (i) Date, time, and points of departure;
              (ii) Destination, date, and time of arrival;
              (iii) Name of each passenger and relationship to the contractor;
              (iv) Authorization for trip; and
              (v) Purpose of trip.
              (3) Where an advance agreement is proposed (see 48 CFR 31.109), consideration may be given to the following:
              (i) Whether scheduled commercial airlines or other suitable, less costly, travel facilities are available at reasonable times, with reasonable frequency, and serve the required destinations conveniently;
              (ii) Whether increased flexibility in scheduling results in time savings and more effective use of personnel that would outweigh additional travel costs.

              (f) Costs of contractor-owned or -leased automobiles, as used in this paragraph, include the costs of lease, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, etc. These costs are allowable, if reasonable, to the extent that the automobiles are used for company business. That portion of the cost of company-furnished automobiles that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is compensation for personal services and is unallowable as stated in 48 CFR 31.205-6(m)(2).

              970.4102-1
              Policy.
              (a) Utility services defined at 48 CFR 41.101 for the furnishing of electricity, gas (natural or manufactured), steam, water, and/or sewerage to facilities owned or leased by Department of Energy (DOE) shall be acquired directly by DOE and not by a contractor using a subcontractor arrangement, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection.
              (b) Where it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, a DOE contracting activity may authorize a management and operating contractor for a facility to acquire such utility service for the facility, after requesting and receiving concurrence to make such an authorization from the Director, Public Utilities Branch, Headquarters. Any request for such concurrence should be included in the Utility Service Requirements and Options Studies required by DOE Order 430.2, or its successor. Alternatively, it may be made in a separate document submitted to the Director of that office early in the acquisition cycle. Any request shall set forth why it is in the best interest of the DOE to acquire utility service(s) by subcontract, i.e., what the benefits are, such as economic advantage.
              (c) The requirements of 48 CFR part 41, this section, and DOE Order 430.2, or its successor, shall be applied to a subcontract level acquisition for furnishing utility services to a facility owned or leased by DOE.

              970.4207-03-02
              Certificate of costs.

              (a) The contracting officer shall require that management and operating contractors provide a submission, pursuant to 970.5232-2-(j), for settlement of costs incurred during the period stipulated on the submission and a certification that the costs included in the submission are allowable. The contracting officer shall assess a penalty pursuant to 970.5242-1 if unallowable costs are included in the submission. Unallowable costs are either expressly unallowable or determined unallowable.
              (1) An expressly unallowable cost is a particular item or type of cost which, under the express provisions of an applicable law, regulation, or this contract, is specifically named and stated to be unallowable.
              (2) A cost determined unallowable is one which, for that contractor—
              (i) Was subject to a contracting officer's final decision and not appealed;
              (ii) The Civilian Board of Contract Appeals or a court has previously ruled as unallowable; or
              (iii) Was mutually agreed to be unallowable.
              (b) If, during the review of the submission, the contracting officer determines that the submission contains an expressly unallowable cost or a cost determined to be unallowable prior to the submission, the contracting officer shall assess a penalty.
              (c) If the contracting officer determines that a cost submitted by the contractor in its submission for settlement is:
              (1) Expressly unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to the contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost. Interest shall be computed from the date of overpayment to the date of repayment using the interest rate specified by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97).
              (2) Determined unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to two times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to the contract.
              (d) The contracting officer may waive the penalty provisions when:
              (1) The contractor withdraws the submission before the formal initiation of an audit of the submission and submits a revised submission;
              (2) The amount of the unallowable costs allocated to covered contracts is $10,000 or less; or
              (3) The contractor demonstrates to the contracting officer's satisfaction that:
              (i) It has established appropriate policies, personnel training, and an internal control and review system that provides assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from the contractor's submission for settlement of costs; and
              (ii) The unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the submission.
              (e) The Head of the Contracting Activity may waive the certification when—
              (1) It determines that it would be in the best interest of the United States to waive such certification; and
              (2) It states in writing the reasons for that determination and makes such determination available to the public.

              (5) The contracting officer shall ensure that the documentation supporting the final settlement addresses the amount of the questioned costs and the subsequent disposition of such questioned costs.

              (6) The contracting officer shall ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the Department of Energy's auditor is afforded an opportunity to attend any negotiation or meeting with the contractor regarding a determination of allowability.

              970.4400
              Scope.
              This subpart prescribes policies and procedures concerning the purchasing systems and activities of management and operating contractors.
            
            
              970.4401

              970.4401-1
              General.
              (a) In the Department of Energy (DOE), overall responsibility for the oversight of the performance of management and operating contractors, including their purchasing activities, rests with the cognizant DOE contracting activity and, in particular, the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA). Contracting officers are responsible for the management and operating contractors' conformance with this subpart and the applicable terms and conditions of their contracts, and for determining whether those purchasing activities provide timely and effective support to DOE programs.
              (b) In carrying out their overall responsibilities, HCAs shall—
              (1) Require management and operating contractors to maintain written descriptions of their individual purchasing systems and methods and further require that, upon award or extension of the contract, the entire written description be submitted to the contracting officer for review and acceptance;
              (2) Require that any changes to the management and operating contractor's written description having any substantive impact upon the contractor's purchasing system and methods be submitted to the contracting officer for review and acceptance prior to issuance;
              (3) Ensure the review of individual purchasing actions of certain types, or above stated dollar levels, by the contracting officer pursuant to 48 CFR subpart 44.2 or as set forth in the contractor's approved system and methods; and
              (4) Ensure that periodic appraisals of the contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function, including compliance with the contractor's approved system and methods, are performed by the contracting officer. Such appraisals shall be performed through either of the following methodologies—
              (i) Contractor Purchasing System Reviews, conducted in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 44.3; or
              (ii) When approved by the contracting officer, contractor participation in the conduct of the Balanced Scorecard performance measurement and performance management system.
              (c) In performing the reviews required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2), and the appraisals required by paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection, HCAs shall assure that contracting officers determine that the contractors' written systems and methods are consistent with this subpart and the applicable terms and conditions of their contracts.

              970.4401-2
              Review and approval.

              (a) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall establish thresholds, by subcontract type and dollar level, for the review and approval of proposed subcontracting actions by each management and operating contractor under their cognizance. Such thresholds may not exceed the authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive. In establishing these thresholds, the Heads of the Contracting Activities should consider such factors as the following—
              
              (1) The nature of work to be performed under the management and operating contract;
              (2) The size, experience, ability, reliability, and organization of the management and operating contractor's purchasing function;
              (3) The internal controls, procedures, and organizational stature of the management and operating contractor's purchasing function; and
              (4) Policies with respect to such reviews and approvals established by the Senior Procurement Executive.
              (b) Prior approval shall be required for the subcontracting of any work a contractor is obligated to perform under a contract entered into under section 41, entitled Production of Special Nuclear Material, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
              (c) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall take such action as may be required to insure compliance with the procedure for purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources or the purchase of specific items, or classes of items, which by the terms of the contract may require DOE approval.
              (d) The Heads of the Contracting Activities may raise or lower the review and approval thresholds established pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection at any time. Such action may be considered upon the periodic review of the contractor's purchasing system, but in any case those adjusted thresholds may not exceed the approval authority delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement Executive.
              (e) DOE approvals of specific proposed purchases pursuant to this subpart shall communicate that such approval does not relieve the management and operating contractor of any obligation under its prime contract with DOE; is given without prejudice to any rights or claims of the Government thereunder; creates no obligation on the part of the Government to the subcontractor, and is not a predetermination of the allowability of costs to be incurred under the subcontract.
              (f) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors establish and maintain subcontract files which contain those documents essential to present an accurate and adequate record of all purchasing transactions.
              (g) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating contractors document purchases in writing, setting forth the information and data used in determining that the purchases are in the best interest of the Government. The scope and detail of this documentation shall be consistent with the nature, dollar value, and complexity of the purchase.
              (h) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall assure that the contracting activity establishes and maintains files of the documents associated with the review and approval of subcontract actions subject to DOE review and approval. Those files shall include, among other necessary documentation, an appraisal of the proposed action by the contracting activity and a copy of the approving or disapproving document forwarded to the management and operating contractor, including a listing of any deficiencies, a listing of any required corrective actions, any suggestions, or other relevant comments.

              970.4401-3
              Advance notification.
              (a) Contracting officers shall assure that the written description of the management and operating contractor's purchasing system and methods provides for advance notice to the DOE contracting officer of the proposed award of the following specified types of subcontracts, except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subsection—
              (1) Pursuant to section 304(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Service Act of 1949, as amended (41 U.S.C. 254(b)):
              (i) Cost reimbursement-type subcontracts of any award value; and
              (ii) Fixed price-type subcontracts which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the prime contract.
              (2) Purchases from contractor-affiliated sources over a value established by the HCA.

              (b) Pursuant to section 602(d)13 of the Act (40 U.S.C. 474(13)) referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the advance notification requirement for the types of purchases listed in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply to subcontracts relating to functions derived from the Atomic Energy Commission.
              (c) The advance notice shall contain, at a minimum, a description of work, estimated cost, type of contract or reimbursement provisions, and extent of competition, or justification for a noncompetitive purchase procurement. The contracting officer may at any time request additional information that must be furnished promptly and prior to award of the subcontract.

              970.4402-1
              Policy.
              (a) DOE contracts for the management and operation of its facilities, the design and production of nuclear weapons, energy research and development, and the performance of other services. These management and operating (M&O) contractors have been selected for their technical and managerial expertise and are expected to bring to bear these technical and managerial skills to accomplish the significant Federal mission(s) described in their contracts with, and work plans approved by, DOE.
              (b) Purchasing done by management and operating contractors is one area in which the particular skills of the contractors will be brought to bear in order to more readily accomplish the contractors' assigned missions. The contracting procedures of the contractor's organization, therefore, form the basis for the development of a purchasing system and methods that will comply with its contract with DOE and this subpart.
            
            
              970.4402-2
              General requirements.
              The following shall apply to the purchasing systems of management and operating contractors:
              (a) The objective of a management and operating contractor's purchasing system is to deliver to its customers on a timely basis those best value products and services necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Government's contract. To achieve this objective, contractors are expected to use their experience, expertise and initiative consistent with this subpart.
              (b) The purchasing systems and methods used by management and operating contractors shall be well-defined, consistently applied, and shall follow purchasing practices appropriate for the requirement and dollar value of the purchase. It is anticipated that purchasing practices and procedures will vary among contractors and according to the type and kinds of purchases to be made.
              (c) Contractor purchases are not Federal procurements, and are not directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may affect contractor purchasing, as required by statute, regulation, or contract terms and conditions.
              (d) Contractor purchasing systems shall identify and apply the best in commercial purchasing practices and procedures (although nothing precludes the adoption of Federal procurement practices and procedures) to achieve system objectives. Where specific requirements do not otherwise apply, the contractor purchasing system shall provide for appropriate measures to ensure the—
              (1) Acquisition of quality products and services at fair and reasonable prices;
              (2) Use of capable and reliable subcontractors who either—
              (i) Have track records of successful past performance, or
              (ii) Can demonstrate a current superior ability to perform;
              (3) Minimization of acquisition lead-time and administrative costs of purchasing;
              (4) Use of effective competitive techniques;
              (5) Reduction of performance risks associated with subcontractors, and facilitation of quality relationships which can include techniques such as partnering agreements, ombudsmen, and alternative disputes procedures;

              (6) Use of self-assessment and benchmarking techniques to support continuous improvement in purchasing;
              (7) Maintenance of the highest professional and ethical standards;
              (8) Maintenance of file documentation appropriate to the value of the purchase and which is adequate to establish the propriety of the transaction and the price paid; and
              (9) Maximization of opportunities for small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and woman-owned small business concerns to participate in contract performance.

              970.4402-3
              Purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources.
              (a) A management and operating contractor may purchase from sources affiliated with the contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate of the contractor or its parent company) in the same manner as from other sources, provided—
              (1) The management and operating contractor's purchasing function is independent of the proposed contractor-affiliated source;
              (2) The same terms and conditions would apply if the purchase were from a third party;
              (3) Award is made in accordance with policies and procedures designed to permit effective competition which have been approved by the contracting officer. (This requirement for competition shall not preclude acquisition of technical services from contractor-affiliated entities where those entities have a special expertise, and the basis therefore is documented.); and
              (4) The award is legally enforceable where the entities are separately incorporated.
              (b) Subcontracts for performance of contract work itself (as distinguished from the purchase of supplies and services needed in connection with the performance of work) require DOE authorization and may involve an adjustment of the contractor's fee, if any. If the management and operating contractor seeks authorization to have some part of the contract work performed by a contractor-affiliated source, and that contractor's performance of that work was a factor in the negotiated fee, DOE approval would normally require—
              (1) That the contractor-affiliated source perform such work without fee or profit; or
              (2) An equitable downward adjustment to the management and operating contractor's fee, if any.
              (c) Determination on cost of money allowance as prescribed at 48 CFR 31.225-10 shall be treated as follows:
              (1) When a purchase from a contractor-affiliated source results from competition and is in accord with provisions and conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this subsection, the contractor-affiliated source may include cost of money as an allowable element of the costs of its goods or services supplied to the contractor; provided—
              (i) The purchase is based on cost as set forth in 48 CFR 31.205-26(e); and
              (ii) The cost of money amount is computed in accordance with 48 CFR 31.205-10 and related procedures (see 970.30).
              (2) When a purchase from a contractor-affiliated source is made non-competitively, cost of money shall not be considered an allowable element of the cost of the contractor-affiliated source purchase.

              Nuclear material transfers.
              (a) Management and operating contractors, in preparing subcontracts or other agreements in which monetary payments or credits depend on the quantity and quality of nuclear material, shall be required to assure that each such subcontract or agreement contains a—
              (1) Description of the material to be transferred;
              (2) Provision specifying the method by which the quantities are to be measured and reported;
              (3) Provision specifying the procedures to be used in resolving any differences arising as a result of such measurements;

              (4) Provision for the use of an independent third party as an umpire to settle unresolved differences in the analytical samples; and
              
              (5) Provision specifying in detail which party shall bear the costs of resolving a difference and what constitutes such costs.
              (b) The provisions providing for resolution of measurement differences must be such that resolution is always accomplished, while at the same time minimizing any advantage one party may have over the other.

              DOE contractors with whom statutory nuclear hazards indemnity agreements under the authority of section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, are executed will not normally be required or permitted to furnish financial protection by purchase of insurance to cover public liability for nuclear incidents. However, if authorized by the DOE Headquarters office having responsibility for contractor casualty insurance programs, DOE contractors may be—

              (a) Permitted to furnish financial protection to themselves; or
              
              (b) Permitted to continue to carry such insurance at cost to the Government if they currently maintain insurance for such liability.

              Contract clauses.
              (a) The clause at 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement, shall be included in all management and operating contracts involving the risk of public liability for the occurrence of a nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation arising out of or in connection with the contract work, including such events caused by a product delivered to a DOE-owned, facility for use by DOE or its contractors. The clause at 952.250-70 also shall be included in any management and operating contract for the design of a DOE facility, the construction or operation of which may involve the risk of public liability for a nuclear incident or a precautionary evacuation.
              (b) The clause at 952.250-70 shall not be included in contracts in which the contractor is subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) financial protection requirements under section 170b. of the Act or NRC agreements of indemnification under section 170 c. or k. of the Act for activities to be performed under the contract.

              970.5200
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart prescribes some of the solicitation provisions and contract clauses for use in management and operating contracts. The provisions and clauses contained in this subpart supplement the provisions and clauses prescribed in the FAR and in other parts of the DEAR (48 CFR 901 through 48 CFR 952), and, pursuant to the individual provision or clause prescription, are to be used in addition to or in place of such clauses. Management and operating contracts are hybrid contracts, in some cases including aspects of several FAR contract types, for example, supplies and construction. For some FAR solicitation provisions and contract clauses, this subpart prescribes their use despite the hybrid nature of the work required. To assist Departmental contracting personnel in determining the applicability of FAR and DEAR clauses to management and operating contracts, additional guidance is published and made available by the Office of Procurement and Assistance Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.

                Management Controls (JUN 2007)
                (a)(1) The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining, as an integral part of its organization, effective systems of management controls for both administrative and programmatic functions. Management controls comprise the plan of organization, methods, and procedures adopted by management to reasonably ensure that: the mission and functions assigned to the Contractor are properly executed; efficient and effective operations are promoted including consideration of outsourcing of functions; resources are safeguarded against waste, loss, mismanagement, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; all encumbrances and costs that are incurred under the contract and fees that are earned are in compliance with applicable clauses and other current terms, conditions, and intended purposes; all collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, expenditures, and all other transactions and assets are properly recorded, managed, and reported; and financial, statistical, and other reports necessary to maintain accountability and managerial control are accurate, reliable, and timely.
                (2) The systems of controls employed by the Contractor shall be documented and satisfactory to DOE.
                (3) Such systems shall be an integral part of the Contractor's management functions, including defining specific roles and responsibilities for each level of management, and holding employees accountable for the adequacy of the management systems and controls in their areas of assigned responsibility.

                (4) The Contractor shall, as part of the internal audit program required elsewhere in this contract, periodically review the management systems and controls employed in programs and administrative areas to ensure that they are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the systems are being accomplished and that these systems and controls are working effectively. Annually, or at other intervals directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall supply to the Contracting Officer copies of the reports reflecting the status of recommendations resulting from management audits performed by its internal audit activity and any other audit organization. This requirement may be satisfied in part by the reports required under paragraph (i) of 48 CFR 970.5232-3, Accounts, records, and inspection.
                (b) The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining, as a part of its operational responsibilities, a baseline quality assurance program that implements documented performance, quality standards, and control and assessment techniques.

                Performance Improvement and Collaboration (MAY 2006)
                (a) The Contractor agrees that it shall affirmatively identify, evaluate, and institute practices, where appropriate, that will improve performance in the areas of environmental and health, safety, scientific and technical, security, business and administrative, and any other areas of performance in the management and operation of the contract. This may entail the alteration of existing practices or the institution of new procedures to more effectively or efficiently perform any aspect of contract performance or reduce overall cost of operation under the contract. Such improvements may result from changes in organization, outsourcing decisions, simplification of systems while retaining necessary controls, or any other approaches consistent with the statement of work and performance measures of this contract.
                (b) The Contractor agrees to work collaboratively with the Department, all other management and operating, DOE major facilities management contractors and affiliated contractors which manage or operate DOE sites or facilities for the following purposes: (i) to exchange information generally, (ii) to evaluate concepts that may be of benefit in resolving common issues, in confronting common problems, or in reducing costs of operations, and (iii) to otherwise identify and implement DOE-complex-wide management improvements discussed in paragraph (a). In doing so, it shall also affirmatively provide information relating to its management improvements to such contractors, including lessons learned, subject to security considerations and the protection of data proprietary to third parties.
                (c) The Contractor may consult with the Contracting Officer in those instances in which improvements being considered pursuant to paragraph (a) involve the cooperation of the DOE. The Contractor may request the assistance of the Contracting Officer in the communication of the success of improvements to other management and operating contractors in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause.
                (d) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and seek approval where necessary to fulfill its obligations under the contract. Compliance with this clause in no way alters the obligations of the Contractor under any other provision of this contract.

                Contractor's Organization (DEC 2000)
                (a) Organization chart. As promptly as possible after the execution of this contract, the Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a chart showing the names, duties, and organization of key personnel (see 48 CFR 952.215-70) to be employed in connection with the work, and shall furnish supplemental information to reflect any changes as they occur.
                (b) Supervisory representative of Contractor. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, a competent full-time resident supervisory representative of the Contractor satisfactory to the Contracting Officer shall be in charge of the work at the site, and any work off-site, at all times.
                (c) Control of employees. The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards of employee competency, conduct, and integrity and shall be responsible for taking such disciplinary action with respect to its employees as may be necessary. In the event the Contractor fails to remove any employee from the contract work whom DOE deems incompetent, careless, or insubordinate, or whose continued employment on the work is deemed by DOE to be inimical to the Department's mission, the Contracting Officer may require, with the approval of the Secretary of Energy, the Contractor to remove the employee from work under the contract. This includes the right to direct the Contractor to remove its most senior key person from work under the contract for serious contract performance deficiencies.
                (d) Standards and procedures. The Contractor shall establish such standards and procedures as are necessary to implement the requirements set forth in 48 CFR 970.0371. Such standards and procedures shall be subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

                Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives (DEC 2000)
                (a) In performing work under this contract, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations (including DOE regulations), unless relief has been granted in writing by the appropriate regulatory agency. A List of Applicable Laws and regulations (List A) may be appended to this contract for information purposes. Omission of any applicable law or regulation from List A does not affect the obligation of the Contractor to comply with such law or regulation pursuant to this paragraph.

                (b) In performing work under this contract, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of those Department of Energy directives, or parts thereof, identified in the List of Applicable Directives (List B) appended to this contract. Except as otherwise provided for in paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may, from time to time and at any time, revise List B by unilateral modification to the contract to add, modify, or delete specific requirements. Prior to revising List B, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the Department's intent to revise List B and provide the Contractor with the opportunity to assess the effect of the Contractor's compliance with the revised list on contract cost and funding, technical performance, and schedule; and identify any potential inconsistencies between the revised list and the other terms and conditions of the contract. Within 30 days after receipt of the Contracting Officer's notice, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer in writing of the potential impact of the Contractor's compliance with the revised list. Based on the information provided by the Contractor and any other information available, the Contracting Officer shall decide whether to revise List B and so advise the Contractor not later than 30 days prior to the effective date of the revision of List B. The Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall identify and, if appropriate, agree to any changes to other contract terms and conditions, including cost and schedule, associated with the revision of List B pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled, “Changes.”
                
                (c) Environmental, safety, and health (ES&H) requirements appropriate for work conducted under this contract may be determined by a DOE approved process to evaluate the work and the associated hazards and identify an appropriately tailored set of standards, practices, and controls, such as a tailoring process included in a DOE approved Safety Management System implemented under the clause entitled “Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution.” When such a process is used, the set of tailored (ES&H) requirements, as approved by DOE pursuant to the process, shall be incorporated into List B as contract requirements with full force and effect. These requirements shall supersede, in whole or in part, the contractual environmental, safety, and health requirements previously made applicable to the contract by List B. If the tailored set of requirements identifies an alternative requirement varying from an ES&H requirement of an applicable law or regulation, the Contractor shall request an exemption or other appropriate regulatory relief specified in the regulation.

                (b) Cost estimates. The Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall establish a budget of estimated costs, description of work, and schedule of performance for each work assignment. If agreement cannot be reached as to scope, schedule, and estimated cost, the Contracting Officer may issue a unilateral work authorization, pursuant to this clause. The work authorization, whether issued bilaterally or unilaterally shall become part of the contract. No activities shall be authorized or costs incurred prior to Contracting Officer issuance of a work authorization or direction concerning continuation of activities of the contract.
                (c) Performance. The Contractor shall perform work as specified in the work authorization, consistent with the terms and conditions of this contract.
                (d) Modification. The Contracting Officer may at any time, without notice, issue changes to work authorizations within the overall scope of the contract. A proposal for adjustment in estimated costs and schedule for performance of work, recognizing work made unnecessary as a result, along with new work, shall be submitted by the Contractor in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause. Resolution shall be in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause.
                (e) Increase in estimated cost.

              Total available fee: Base fee amount and performance fee amount.
              As prescribed in 970.1504-5(a), insert the following clause. The clause should be tailored to reflect the contract's actual inclusion of base fee amount and performance fee amount.
              
                Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount (DEC 2000)
                (a) Total available fee. Total available fee, consisting of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (consisting of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both) determined in accordance with the provisions of this clause, is available for payment in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Payments and advances.”
                (b) Fee negotiations. Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year under this contract, or other appropriate period as mutually agreed upon and, if exceeding one year, approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, the Contracting Officer and Contractor shall enter into negotiation of the requirements for the year or appropriate period, including the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee, and the allocation of fee. The Contracting Officer shall modify this contract at the conclusion of each negotiation to reflect the negotiated requirements, evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee, and the allocation of fee. In the event the parties fail to agree on the requirements, the evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee, or the allocation of fee, a unilateral determination will be made by the Contracting Officer. The total available fee amount shall be allocated to a twelve month cycle composed of one or more evaluation periods, or such longer period as may be mutually agreed to between the parties and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee.
                (c) Determination of total available fee amount earned. (1) The Government shall, at the conclusion of each specified evaluation period, evaluate the Contractor's performance of all requirements, including performance based incentives completed during the period, and determine the total available fee amount earned. At the Contracting Officer's discretion, evaluation of incentivized performance may occur at the scheduled completion of specific incentivized requirements.
                (2) The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, will be (insert title of DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee). The Contractor agrees that the determination as to the total available fee earned is a unilateral determination made by the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee.
                (3) The evaluation of Contractor performance shall be in accordance with the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) described in subparagraph (d) of this clause unless otherwise set forth in the contract. The Contractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the fee determination, and the basis of the fee determination. In the event that the Contractor's performance is considered to be less than the level of performance set forth in the Statement of Work, as amended to include the current Work Authorization Directive or similar document, for any contract requirement, it will be considered by the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, who may at his/her discretion adjust the fee determination to reflect such performance. Any such adjustment shall be in accordance with the clause entitled, “Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts” if contained in the contract.
                (d) Performance evaluation and measurement plan(s). To the extent not set forth elsewhere in the contract:
                (1) The Government shall establish a Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) upon which the determination of the total available fee amount earned shall be based. The Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) will address all of the requirements of contract performance specified in the contract directly or by reference. A copy of the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) shall be provided to the Contractor—
                (i) Prior to the start of an evaluation period if the requirements, evaluation areas, specific incentives, amount of fee, and allocation of fee to such evaluation areas and specific incentives have been mutually agreed to by the parties; or
                (ii) Not later than thirty days prior to the scheduled start date of the evaluation period, if the requirements, evaluation areas, specific incentives, amount of fee, and allocation of fee to such evaluation areas and specific incentives have been unilaterally established by the Contracting Officer.
                (2) The Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) will set forth the criteria upon which the Contractor will be evaluated relating to any technical, schedule, management, and/or cost objectives selected for evaluation. Such criteria should be objective, but may also include subjective criteria. The Plan(s) shall also set forth the method by which the total available fee amount will be allocated and the amount earned determined.
                (3) The Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) may, consistent with the contract statement of work, be revised during the period of performance. The Contracting Officer shall notify the contractor—
                (i) Of such unilateral changes at least ninety calendar days prior to the end of the affected evaluation period and at least thirty calendar days prior to the effective date of the change;
                (ii) Of such bilateral changes at least sixty calendar days prior to the end of the affected evaluation period; or
                (iii) If such change, whether unilateral or bilateral, is urgent and high priority, at least thirty calendar days prior to the end of the evaluation period.
                (e) Schedule for total available fee amount earned determinations. The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, shall issue the final total available fee amount earned determination in accordance with: the schedule set forth in the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s); or as otherwise set forth in this contract . However, a determination must be made within sixty calendar days after the receipt by the Contracting Officer of the Contractor's self-assessment, if one is required or permitted by paragraph (f) of this clause, or seventy calendar days after the end of the evaluation period, whichever is later, or a longer period if the Contractor and Contracting Officer agree. If the Contracting Officer evaluates the Contractor's performance of specific requirements on their completion, the payment of any earned fee amount must be made within seventy calendar days (or such other time period as mutually agreed to between the Contracting Officer and the Contractor) after such completion. If the determination is delayed beyond that date, the Contractor shall be entitled to interest on the determined total available fee amount earned at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the payment date. This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest on any late total available fee amount earned determination will accrue daily and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the schedule determination date through the actual date the determination is issued. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the determined amount of fee earned and be subject to interest if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period.

                (f) Contractor self-assessment. Following each evaluation period, the Contractor shall submit a self-assessment within (Insert Number) calendar days after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall address both the strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the Contractor shall describe the actions planned or taken to correct such deficiencies and avoid their recurrence. The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, will review the Contractor's self-assessment, if submitted, as part of its independent evaluation of the Contractor's management during the period. A self-assessment, in and of itself may not be the only basis for the award fee determination.

                (f) Contractor self-assessment. Following each evaluation period, the Contractor may submit a self-assessment, provided such assessment is submitted within (Insert Number) calendar days after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall address both the strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the Contractor shall describe the actions planned or taken to correct such deficiencies and avoid their recurrence. The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, will review the Contractor's self-assessment, if submitted, as part of its independent evaluation of the Contractor's management during the period.

              Conditional payment of fee, profit, and other incentives—facility management contracts
              As prescribed in 970.1504-5(b)(1), insert the following clause:
              
                Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, and Other Incentives—Facility Management Contracts (AUG 2009)
                (a) General. (1) The payment of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings under this contract is dependent upon—
                
                (i) The Contractor's or Contractor employees' compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to environment, safety and health (ES&H), which includes worker safety and health (WS&H), including performance under an approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS); and
                (ii) The Contractor's or Contractor employees' compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information.
                (2) The ES&H performance requirements of this contract are set forth in its ES&H terms and conditions, including the DOE approved contractor ISMS or similar document. Financial incentives for timely mission accomplishment or cost effectiveness shall never compromise or impede full and effective implementation of the ISMS and full ES&H compliance.
                (3) The performance requirements of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information are set forth in the clauses of this contract entitled, “Security” and “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives,” as well as in other terms and conditions.
                (4) If the Contractor does not meet the performance requirements of this contract relating to ES&H or to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information during any performance evaluation period established under the contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled, “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount,” otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit or share of cost savings may be unilaterally reduced by the contracting officer.
                (b) Reduction amount. (1) The amount of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings that may be unilaterally reduced will be determined by the severity of the performance failure pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause.
                (2) If a reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings is warranted, unless mitigating factors apply, such reduction shall not be less than 26 percent nor greater than 100 percent of the amount of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or the Contractor's share of cost savings for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11 percent nor greater than 25 percent for a second degree performance failure, and up to 10 percent for a third degree performance failure.
                (3) In determining the amount of the reduction and the applicability of mitigating factors, the contracting officer must consider the Contractor's overall performance in meeting the ES&H or security requirements of the contract. Such consideration must include performance against any site specific performance criteria/requirements that provide additional definition, guidance for the amount of reduction, or guidance for the applicability of mitigating factors. In all cases, the contracting officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range (see 48 CFR 970.1504-1-2). The mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, the following ((v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) apply to ES&H only).
                (i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.
                (ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance.
                (iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.
                (iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of: ES&H and compliance in related areas; or of safeguarding Restricted Data and other classified information and compliance in related areas.
                (v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial ES&H standards are routinely practiced (e.g., Voluntary Protection Program, ISO 14000).
                (vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor (e.g., offsite emergency response).
                (vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain ES&H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making (e.g., policy, ES&H programs). * * *
                (viii) Contractor demonstration that an Operating Experience and Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in ES&H by use of lessons-learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.
                (4)(i) The amount of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings that is otherwise earned by a contractor during an evaluation period may be reduced in accordance with this clause if it is determined that a performance failure warranting a reduction under this clause occurs within the evaluation period.
                (ii) The amount of reduction under this clause, in combination with any reduction made under any other clause in the contract, shall not exceed the amount of fee, fixed fee, profit, or the Contractor's share of cost savings that is otherwise earned during the evaluation period.

                (iii) For the purposes of this clause, earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings for the evaluation period shall mean the amount determined by the Contracting Officer or fee determination official as otherwise payable based on the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. Where the contract provides for financial incentives that extend beyond a single evaluation period, this amount shall also include: any provisional amounts determined otherwise payable in the evaluation period; and, if provisional payments are not provided for, the allocable amount of any incentive determined otherwise payable at the conclusion of a subsequent evaluation period. The allocable amount shall be the total amount of the earned incentive divided by the number of evaluation periods over which it was earned.
                (iv) The Government will effect the reduction as soon as practicable after the end of the evaluation period in which the performance failure occurs. If the Government is not aware of the failure, it will effect the reduction as soon as practical after becoming aware. For any portion of the reduction requiring an allocation the Government will effect the reduction at the end of the evaluation period in which it determines the total amount earned under the incentive. If at any time a reduction causes the sum of the payments the Contractor has received for fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings to exceed the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned (provisionally or otherwise), the Contractor shall immediately return the excess to the Government. (What the Contractor “has earned” reflects any reduction made under this or any other clause of the contract.)
                (v) At the end of the contract—
                (A) The Government will pay the Contractor the amount by which the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned exceeds the sum of the payments the Contractor has received; or
                (B) The Contractor shall return to the Government the amount by which the sum of the payments the Contractor has received exceeds the sum of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings the Contractor has earned. (What the Contractor “has earned” reflects any reduction made under this or any other clause of the contract.)
                (c) Environment, Safety and Health (ES&H). Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the contract's ES&H terms and conditions, including the DOE approved Contractor ISMS. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of earned or fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings will be determined are:
                (1) First Degree: Performance failures that are most adverse to ES&H. Failure to develop and obtain required DOE approval of an ISMS is considered first degree. The Government will perform necessary review of the ISMS in a timely manner and will not unreasonably withhold approval of the Contractor's ISMS. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered first degree.
                (i) Type A accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1B, or successor version).
                (ii) Two Second Degree performance failures during an evaluation period.
                (2) Second Degree: Performance failures that are significantly adverse to ES&H. They include failures to comply with an approved ISMS that result in an actual injury, exposure, or exceedence that occurred or nearly occurred but had minor practical long-term health consequences. They also include breakdowns of the Safety Management System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered second degree:
                (i) Type B accident (defined in DOE Order 225.1B, or successor version).
                (ii) Non-compliance with an approved ISMS that results in a near miss of a Type A or B accident. A near miss is a situation in which an inappropriate action occurs, or a necessary action is omitted, but does not result in an adverse effect.
                (iii) Failure to mitigate or notify DOE of an imminent danger situation after discovery, where such notification is a requirement of the contract.
                (3) Third Degree: Performance failures that reflect a lack of focus on improving ES&H. They include failures to comply with an approved ISMS that result in potential breakdown of the System. The following performance failures or performance failures of similar import will be considered third degree:
                (i) Failure to implement effective corrective actions to address deficiencies/non-compliances documented through: external (e.g., Federal) oversight and/or reported per DOE Order 232.1-2 requirements; or internal oversight of DOE Order 440.1A requirements.
                (ii) Multiple similar non-compliances identified by external (e.g., Federal) oversight that in aggregate indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.
                (iii) Non-compliances that either have, or may have, significant negative impacts to the worker, the public, or the environment or that indicate a significant programmatic breakdown.
                (iv) Failure to notify DOE upon discovery of events or conditions where notification is required by the terms and conditions of the contract.
                (d) Safeguarding restricted data and other classified information. Performance failures occur if the Contractor does not comply with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to the safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. The degrees of performance failure under which reductions of fee, profit, or share of cost savings will be determined are as follows:
                (1) First Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, DOE regulation, or directive, to have resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered first degree:
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating a risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a Special Access Program (SAP), information identified as sensitive compartmented information (SCI), or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Top Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Top Secret, any classification level of information in a SAP, information identified as SCI, or high risk nuclear weapons-related data.
                (2) Second Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, DOE regulation, or directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, serious damage to the national security. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered second degree:
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other information classified as Secret.
                (ii) Contractor actions that result in a breakdown of the safeguards and security management system that can reasonably be expected to result in the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data, or other information classified as Secret.
                (iii) Failure to promptly report the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other classified information regardless of classification (except for information covered by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this clause).
                (iv) Failure to timely implement corrective actions stemming from the loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Secret Restricted Data or other classified information classified as Secret.
                (3) Third Degree: Performance failures that have been determined, in accordance with applicable law, regulation, or DOE directive, to have actually resulted in, or that can reasonably be expected to result in, undue risk to the common defense and security. In addition, this category includes performance failures that result from a lack of Contractor management and/or employee attention to the proper safeguarding of Restricted Data and other classified information. These performance failures may be indicators of future, more severe performance failures and/or conditions, and if identified and corrected early would prevent serious incidents. The following are examples of performance failures or performance failures of similar import that will be considered third degree:
                (i) Non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and DOE directives actually resulting in, or creating risk of, loss, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure of Restricted Data or other information classified as Confidential.
                (ii) Failure to promptly report alleged or suspected violations of laws, regulations, or directives pertaining to the safeguarding of Restricted Data or other classified information.
                (iii) Failure to identify or timely execute corrective actions to mitigate or eliminate identified vulnerabilities and reduce residual risk relating to the protection of Restricted Data or other classified information in accordance with the Contractor's Safeguards and Security Plan or other security plan, as applicable.
                (iv) Contractor actions that result in performance failures which unto themselves pose minor risk, but when viewed in the aggregate indicate degradation in the integrity of the Contractor's safeguards and security management system relating to the protection of Restricted Data and other classified information.

                Alternate I (AUG 2009). As prescribed in 970.1504-5(b)(2), replace paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of the basic clause with the following paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) and delete paragraph (d).
              
              
                (a) General. (1) The payment of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings under this contract is dependent upon the Contractor's or Contractor employees' compliance with the terms and conditions of this contract relating to environment, safety and health (ES&H), which includes worker safety and health (WS&H), including performance under an approved Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS).
                (2) The ES&H performance requirements of this contract are set forth in its ES&H terms and conditions, including the DOE approved contractor ISMS or similar document. Financial incentives for timely mission accomplishment or cost effectiveness shall never compromise or impede full and effective implementation of the ISMS and full ES&H compliance.
                (3) If the Contractor does not meet the performance requirements of this contract relating to ES&H during any performance evaluation period established under the contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled, “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount,” otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit or share of cost savings may be unilaterally reduced by the Contracting Officer.
                (b) Reduction amount. (1) The amount of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings that may be unilaterally reduced will be determined by the severity of the performance failure pursuant to the degrees specified in paragraph (c) of this clause.
                (2) If a reduction of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings is warranted, unless mitigating factors apply, such reduction shall not be less than 26 percent nor greater than 100 percent of the amount of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or the Contractor's share of cost savings for a first degree performance failure, not less than 11 percent nor greater than 25 percent for a second degree performance failure, and up to 10 percent for a third degree performance failure.
                (3) In determining the amount of the reduction and the applicability of mitigating factors, the Contracting Officer must consider the Contractor's overall performance in meeting the ES&H requirements of the contract. Such consideration must include performance against any site specific performance criteria/requirements that provide additional definition, guidance for the amount of reduction, or guidance for the applicability of mitigating factors. In all cases, the Contracting Officer must consider mitigating factors that may warrant a reduction below the applicable range (see 48 CFR 970.1504-1-2). The mitigating factors include the following.
                (i) Degree of control the Contractor had over the event or incident.
                (ii) Efforts the Contractor had made to anticipate and mitigate the possibility of the event in advance.
                (iii) Contractor self-identification and response to the event to mitigate impacts and recurrence.
                (iv) General status (trend and absolute performance) of ES&H and compliance in related areas.
                (v) Contractor demonstration to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that the principles of industrial ES&H standards are routinely practiced (e.g., Voluntary Protection Program Star Status, or ISO 14000 Certification).
                (vi) Event caused by “Good Samaritan” act by the Contractor (e.g., offsite emergency response).
                (vii) Contractor demonstration that a performance measurement system is routinely used to improve and maintain ES&H performance (including effective resource allocation) and to support DOE corporate decision-making (e.g., policy, ES&H programs).
                (viii) Contractor demonstration that an Operating Experience and Feedback Program is functioning that demonstrably affects continuous improvement in ES&H by use of lessons-learned and best practices inter- and intra-DOE sites.
              
              
              
                Alternate II (AUG 2009). As prescribed in 970.1504-5(b)(3), insert the following as paragraphs (e) and (f), incentive fee or multiple fee basis (if Alternate I is also used, redesignate the following as paragraphs (d) and (e)).
              
              
                (e) Minimum requirements for specified level of performance. (1) At a minimum the Contractor must perform the following—
                (i) The requirements with specific incentives which do not require the achievement of cost efficiencies in order to be performed at the level of performance set forth in the Statement of Work, Work Authorization Directive, or similar document unless an otherwise minimum level of performance has been established in the specific incentive;
                (ii) All of the performance requirements directly related to requirements specifically incentivized which do not require the achievement of cost efficiencies in order to be performed at a level of performance such that the overall performance of these related requirements is at an acceptable level; and
                (iii) All other requirements at a level of performance such that the total performance of the contract is not jeopardized.
                (2) The evaluation of the Contractor's achievement of the level of performance shall be unilaterally determined by the Government. To the extent that the Contractor fails to achieve the minimum performance levels specified in the Statement of Work, Work Authorization Directive, or similar document, during the performance evaluation period, the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, may reduce any otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net savings for the performance evaluation period. Such reduction shall not result in the total of earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net savings being less than 25 percent of the total available fee amount. Such 25 percent shall include base fee, if any.
                (f) Minimum requirements for cost performance. (1) Requirements incentivized by other than cost incentives must be performed within their specified cost constraint and must not adversely impact the costs of performing unrelated activities.
                (2) The performance of requirements with a specific cost incentive must not adversely impact the costs of performing unrelated requirements.
                (3) The Contractor's performance within the stipulated cost performance levels for the performance evaluation period shall be determined by the Government. To the extent the Contractor fails to achieve the stipulated cost performance levels, the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, may reduce in whole or in part any otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net savings for the performance evaluation period. Such reduction shall not result in the total of earned fee, fixed fee, profit or shared net savings being less than 25 percent of the total available fee amount. Such 25 percent shall include base fee, if any.

              970.5215-4
              Cost reduction.
              As prescribed in 970.1504-5(c), insert the following clause:
              
                Cost Reduction (AUG 2009)
                (a) General. It is the Department of Energy's (DOE's) intent to have its facilities and laboratories operated in an efficient and effective manner. To this end, the Contractor shall assess its operations and identify areas where cost reductions would bring cost efficiency to operations without adversely affecting the level of performance required by the contract. The Contractor, to the maximum extent practical, shall identify areas where cost reductions may be effected, and develop and submit Cost Reduction Proposals (CRPs) to the Contracting Officer. If accepted, the Contractor may share in any shared net savings from accepted CRPs in accordance with paragraph (g) of this clause.
                (b) Definitions. Administrative cost is the Contractor cost of developing and administering the CRP.
                
                  Design, process, or method change is a change to a design, process, or method which has established cost, technical and schedule baseline, is defined, and is subject to a formal control procedure. Such a change must be innovative, initiated by the Contractor, and applied to a specific project or program.
                
                  Development cost is the Contractor cost of up-front planning, engineering, prototyping, and testing of a design, process, or method.
                
                  DOE cost is the Government cost incurred implementing and validating the CRP.
                
                  Implementation cost is the Contractor cost of tooling, facilities, documentation, etc., required to effect a design, process, or method change once it has been tested and approved.
                
                  Net Savings means a reduction in the total amount (to include all related costs and fee) of performing the effort where the savings revert to DOE control and may be available for deobligation. Such savings may result from a specific cost reduction effort which is negotiated on a cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price basis, or may result directly from a design, process, or method change. They may also be savings resulting from formal or informal direction given by DOE or from changes in the mission, work scope, or routine reorganization of the Contractor due to changes in the budget.
                
                  Shared Net Savings are those net savings which result from—
                (1) A specific cost reduction effort which is negotiated on a cost-plus-incentive-fee or fixed-price incentive basis, and is the difference between the negotiated target cost of performing an effort as negotiated and the actual allowable cost of performing that effort; or
                (2) A design, process, or method change, which occurs in the fiscal year in which the change is accepted and the subsequent fiscal year, and is the difference between the estimated cost of performing an effort as originally planned and the actual allowable cost of performing that same effort utilizing a revised plan intended to reduce costs along with any Contractor development costs, implementation costs, administrative costs, and DOE costs associated with the revised plan. Administrative costs and DOE costs are only included at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Savings resulting from formal or informal direction given by the DOE or changes in the mission, work scope, or routine reorganization of the Contractor due to changes in the budget are not to be considered as shared net savings for purposes of this clause and do not qualify for incentive sharing.
                (c) Procedure for submission of CRPs. (1) CRPs for the establishment of cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price efforts or for design, process, or methods changes submitted by the Contractor shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
                (i) Current Method (Baseline)—A verifiable description of the current scope of work, cost, and schedule to be impacted by the initiative, and supporting documentation.
                (ii) New Method (New Proposed Baseline)—A verifiable description of the new scope of work, cost, and schedule, how the initiative will be accomplished, and supporting documentation.

                (iii) Feasibility Assessment—A description and evaluation of the proposed initiative and benefits, risks, and impacts of implementation. This evaluation shall include an assessment of the difference between the current method (baseline) and proposed new method including all related costs.
                (2) In addition, CRPs for the establishment of cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price efforts shall contain, at a minimum, the following—
                (i) The proposed contractual arrangement and the justification for its use; and
                (ii) A detailed cost/price estimate and supporting rationale. If the approach is proposed on an incentive basis, minimum and maximum cost estimates should be included along with any proposed sharing arrangements.
                (d) Evaluation and decision. All CRPs must be submitted to and approved by the Contracting Officer. Included in the information provided by the CRP must be a discussion of the extent the proposed cost reduction effort may—
                (1) Pose a risk to the health and safety of workers, the community, or to the environment;
                (2) Result in a waiver or deviation from DOE requirements, such as DOE Orders and joint oversight agreements;
                (3) Require a change in other contractual agreements;
                (4) Result in significant organizational and personnel impacts;
                (5) Create a negative impact on the cost, schedule, or scope of work in another area;
                (6) Pose a potential negative impact on the credibility of the Contractor or the DOE; and
                (7) Impact successful and timely completion of any of the work in the cost, technical, and schedule baseline.
                (e) Acceptance or rejection of CRPs. Acceptance or rejection of a CRP is a unilateral determination made by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor that a CRP has been accepted, rejected, or deferred within (Insert Number) days of receipt. The only CRPs that will be considered for acceptance are those which the Contractor can demonstrate, at a minimum, will—
                (1) Result in net savings (in the sharing period if a design, process, or method change);
                (2) Not reappear as costs in subsequent periods; and
                (3) Not result in any impairment of essential functions.
                (f) The failure of the Contracting Officer to notify the Contractor of the acceptance, rejection, or deferral of a CRP within the specified time shall not be construed as approval.
                (g) Adjustment to original estimated cost and fee. If a CRP is established on a cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive or firm-fixed-price basis, the originally estimated cost and fee for the total effort shall be adjusted to remove the estimated cost and fee amount associated with the CRP effort.
                (h) Sharing arrangement. If a CRP is accepted, the Contractor may share in the shared net savings. For a CRP negotiated on a cost-plus-incentive-fee or fixed-price incentive basis, with the specific incentive arrangement (negotiated target costs, target fees, share lines, ceilings, profit, etc.) set forth in the contractual document authorizing the effort, the Contractor's share shall be the actual fee or profit resulting from such an arrangement. For a CRP negotiated as a cost savings incentive resulting from a design, process, or method change, the Contractor's share shall be a percentage, not to exceed 25% of the shared net savings. The specific percentage and sharing period shall be set forth in the contractual document.
                (i) Validation of Shared Net Savings. The Contracting Officer shall validate actual shared net savings. If actual shared net savings cannot be validated, the Contractor will not be entitled to a share of the net shared savings.
                (j) Relationship to other incentives. Only those benefits of an accepted CRP not awardable under other clauses of this contract shall be considered under this clause.
                (k) Subcontracts. The Contractor may include a clause similar to this clause in any subcontract. In calculating any estimated shared net savings in a CRP under this contract, the Contractor's administration, development, and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's allowable costs, and any CRP incentive payments to a subcontractor resulting from the acceptance of such CRP. The Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor CRP incentive payments, provided that the payments not reduce the DOE's share of shared net savings.

                Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health Into Work Planning and Execution (DEC 2000)
                (a) For the purposes of this clause,
                (1) Safety encompasses environment, safety and health, including pollution prevention and waste minimization; and
                (2) Employees include subcontractor employees.

                (b) In performing work under this contract, the Contractor shall perform work safely, in a manner that ensures adequate protection for employees, the public, and the environment, and shall be accountable for the safe performance of work. The Contractor shall exercise a degree of care commensurate with the work and the associated hazards. The Contractor shall ensure that management of environment, safety and health (ES&H) functions and activities becomes an integral but visible part of the Contractor's work planning and execution processes. The Contractor shall, in the performance of work, ensure that:
                (1) Line management is responsible for the protection of employees, the public, and the environment. Line management includes those Contractor and subcontractor employees managing or supervising employees performing work.
                (2) Clear and unambiguous lines of authority and responsibility for ensuring ES&H are established and maintained at all organizational levels.
                (3) Personnel possess the experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities that are necessary to discharge their responsibilities.
                (4) Resources are effectively allocated to address ES&H, programmatic, and operational considerations. Protecting employees, the public, and the environment is a priority whenever activities are planned and performed.
                (5) Before work is performed, the associated hazards are evaluated and an agreed-upon set of ES&H standards and requirements are established which, if properly implemented, provide adequate assurance that employees, the public, and the environment are protected from adverse consequences.
                (6) Administrative and engineering controls to prevent and mitigate hazards are tailored to the work being performed and associated hazards.

The System shall also describe how the Contractor will measure system effectiveness.
                (e) The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer documentation of its System for review and approval. Dates for submittal, discussions, and revisions to the System will be established by the Contracting Officer. Guidance on the preparation, content, review, and approval of the System will be provided by the Contracting Officer. On an annual basis, the Contractor shall review and update, for DOE approval, its safety performance objectives, performance measures, and commitments consistent with and in response to DOE's program and budget execution guidance and direction. Resources shall be identified and allocated to meet the safety objectives and performance commitments as well as maintain the integrity of the entire System. Accordingly, the System shall be integrated with the Contractor's business processes for work planning, budgeting, authorization, execution, and change control.
                (f) The Contractor shall comply with, and assist the Department of Energy in complying with, ES&H requirements of all applicable laws and regulations, and applicable directives identified in the clause of this contract entitled “Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives.” The Contractor shall cooperate with Federal and non-Federal agencies having jurisdiction over ES&H matters under this contract.

                (g) The Contractor shall promptly evaluate and resolve any noncompliance with applicable ES&H requirements and the System. If the Contractor fails to provide resolution or if, at any time, the Contractor's acts or failure to act causes substantial harm or an imminent danger to the environment or health and safety of employees or the public, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping work in whole or in part. Any stop work order issued by a contracting officer under this clause (or issued by the Contractor to a subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (i) of this clause) shall be without prejudice to any other legal or contractual rights of the Government. In the event that the Contracting Officer issues a stop work order, an order authorizing the resumption of the work may be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or additional fee or damages by reason of, or in connection with, any work stoppage ordered in accordance with this clause.
                (h) Regardless of the performer of the work, the Contractor is responsible for compliance with the ES&H requirements applicable to this contract. The Contractor is responsible for flowing down the ES&H requirements applicable to this contract to subcontracts at any tier to the extent necessary to ensure the Contractor's compliance with the requirements.
                (i) The Contractor shall include a clause substantially the same as this clause in subcontracts involving complex or hazardous work on site at a DOE-owned or -leased facility. Such subcontracts shall provide for the right to stop work under the conditions described in paragraph (g) of this clause. Depending on the complexity and hazards associated with the work, the Contractor may choose not to require the subcontractor to submit a Safety Management System for the Contractor's review and approval.

                (7) International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130);
                (8) Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR parts 730 through 774); and
                (9) Regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (31 CFR parts 500 through 598).
                (d) In addition to the Federal laws and regulations cited above, National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189, National Policy on the Transfer of Scientific, Technical, and Engineering Information establishes a national policy that, to the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental research shall remain unrestricted. NSDD 189 provides that no restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. statutes. As a result, contracts confined to the performance of unclassified fundamental research generally do not involve any export-controlled activities.

                NSDD 189 does not take precedence over statutes. NSDD 189 does not exempt any research from statutes that apply to export controls such as the Atomic Energy Act, as amended; the Arms Export Control Act; the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended; or the U.S. International Emergency Economic Powers Act; or the regulations that implement those statutes (e.g., the ITAR, the EAR, 10 CFR part 110 and 10 CFR part 810). Thus, if items (e.g., commodities, software or technologies) that are controlled by U.S. export control laws or regulations are used to conduct research or are generated as part of the research efforts, the export control laws and regulations apply to the controlled items.
                (e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all solicitations and subcontracts.

                (i) Promptly submit written notice to the contracting officer setting forth reasons or the subcontractor's refusal and other pertinent information which may expedite disposition of the matter, and
                (ii) Not proceed with the subcontract without the written authorization of the contracting officer.
                (3) Neither the Contractor nor higher-tier subcontractors shall use their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for their private use.
                (e) Rights in Limited Rights Data. Except as may be otherwise specified in this Contract as data which are not subject to this paragraph, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license by or for the Government, in any limited rights data of the Contractor specifically used in the performance of this Contract, provided, however, that to the extent that any limited rights data when furnished or delivered is specifically identified by the Contractor at the time of initial delivery to the Government or a representative of the Government, such data shall not be used within or outside the Government except as provided in the “Limited Rights Notice” set forth. All such limited rights data shall be marked with the following “Limited Rights Notice”:
                Limited Rights Notice
                These data contain “limited rights data,” furnished under Contract No. ________ with the United States Department of Energy which may be duplicated and used by the Government with the express limitations that the “limited rights data” may not be disclosed outside the Government or be used for purposes of manufacture without prior permission of the Contractor, except that further disclosure or use may be made solely for the following purposes:

                (c) Copyright (General). (1) The Contractor agrees not to mark, register, or otherwise assert copyright in any data in a published or unpublished work, other than as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.
                (2) Except for material to which the Contractor has obtained the right to assert copyright in accordance with either paragraph (d) or (e) of this clause, the Contractor agrees not to include in the data delivered under this Contract any material copyrighted by the Contractor and not to knowingly include any material copyrighted by others without first granting or obtaining at no cost a license therein for the benefit of the Government of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (d) of this clause. If the Contractor believes that such copyrighted material for which the license cannot be obtained must be included in the data to be delivered, rather than merely incorporated therein by reference, the Contractor shall obtain the written authorization of the contracting officer to include such material in the data prior to its delivery.
                (d) Copyrighted works (scientific and technical articles). (1) The Contractor shall have the right to assert, without prior approval of the contracting officer, copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles composed under this contract or based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this Contract, and published in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia, proceedings, or similar works. When assertion of copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) on the data when such data are delivered to the Government as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government.
                (2) The contractor shall mark each scientific or technical article first produced or composed under this Contract and submitted for journal publication or similar means of dissemination with a notice, similar in all material respects to the following, on the front reflecting the Government's non-exclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license in the copyright.
                Notice: This manuscript has been authored by [insert the name of the Contractor] under Contract No. [insert the contract number] with the U.S. Department of Energy. The United States Government retains and the publisher, by accepting the article for publication, acknowledges that the United States Government retains a non-exclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license to publish or reproduce the published form of this manuscript, or allow others to do so, for United States Government purposes.
                (End of notice)
                (3) The title to the copyright of the original of unclassified graduate theses and the original of related unclassified scientific papers shall vest in the author thereof, subject to the right of DOE to retain duplicates of such documents and to use such documents for any purpose whatsoever without any claim on the part of the author or the contractor for additional compensation.
                (e) Copyrighted works (other than scientific and technical articles and data produced under a CRADA). The Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subsisting in technical data and computer software first produced by the Contractor in performance of this Contract, where the Contractor can show that commercialization would be enhanced by such copyright protection, subject to the following:
                (1) Contractor Request to Assert Copyright.

                (i) For data other than scientific and technical articles and data produced under a CRADA, the Contractor shall submit in writing to Patent Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the performance of this Contract pursuant to this clause. The right of the Contractor to copyright data first produced under a CRADA is as described in the individual CRADA. Each request by the Contractor must include:
                (A) The identity of the data (including any computer program) for which the Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as an abstract which is descriptive of the data and is suitable for dissemination purposes, (B) The program under which it was funded, (C) Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to an international treaty or agreement, (D) Whether the data is subject to export control, (E) A statement that the Contractor plans to commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract entitled, “Technology Transfer Mission,” within five (5) years after obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer period, and (F) For data other than computer software, a statement explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination responsibilities.
                (ii) For data that is developed using other funding sources in addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such permission has been obtained.
                (iii) Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted categories of data as determined by DOE will be expressly withheld. Such excepted categories include data whose release (A) would be detrimental to national security, i.e., involve classified information or data or sensitive information under Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation and other nuclear-related national security purposes, (B) would not enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization of such data, (C) would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial competitiveness, (D) would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations under treaties and international agreements, or (E) would be detrimental to one or more of DOE's programs. Additional excepted categories may be added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, all data developed with Naval Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international agreements identified under this Contract as well as those additional treaties and international agreements which DOE may from time to time identify by unilateral amendment to the Contract; such amendment listing added treaties and international agreements is effective only for data which is developed after the date such treaty or international agreement is added to this Contract. Also, the Contractor will not be permitted to assert copyright in data in the form of various technical reports generated by the Contractor under the Contract without first obtaining the advanced written permission of the contracting officer.
                (2) DOE Review and Response to Contractor's Request. The Patent Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 90 days of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor.
                (3) Permission for Contractor to Assert Copyright.
                (i) For computer software, the Contractor shall furnish to the DOE designated, centralized software distribution and control point, the Energy Science and Technology Software Center, at the time permission to assert copyright is given under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause: (A) An abstract describing the software suitable for publication, (B) the source code for each software program, and (C) the object code and at least the minimum support documentation needed by a technically competent user to understand and use the software. The Patent Counsel, for good cause shown by the Contractor, may allow the minimum support documentation to be delivered within 60 days after permission to assert copyright is given or at such time the minimum support documentation becomes available. The Contractor acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control point may provide a technical description of the software in an announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder.

                (ii) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, for data other than computer software to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause above, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such permission furnish to DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the copyright holder.
                (iii) For a five year period or such other specified period as specifically approved by Patent Counsel beginning on the date the Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Upon request, the initial period may be extended after DOE approval. The DOE approval will be based on the standard that the work is still commercially available and the market demand is being met.
                (iv) After the period approved by Patent Counsel for application of the limited Government license described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this clause, or if, prior to the end of such period(s), the Contractor abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so.
                (v) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of paragraphs (e)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this clause. Such action shall be taken when the data are delivered to the Government, published, licensed or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights shall be as follows: Notice: These data were produced by (insert name of Contractor) under Contract No. _______ with the Department of Energy. For (period approved by DOE Patent Counsel) from (date permission to assert copyright was obtained), the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. There is provision for the possible extension of the term of this license. Subsequent to that period or any extension granted, the Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data , apparatus, product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not infringe privately owned rights.
                (End of notice)
                (vi) With respect to any data to which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright, the DOE has the right, during the five (5) year or specified longer period approved by Patent Counsel as provided for in paragraph (e) of this clause, to request the Contractor to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor refuses such request, to grant such license itself, if the DOE determines that the Contractor has not made a satisfactory demonstration that either it or its licensee(s) is actively pursuing commercialization of the data as set forth in subparagraph (e)(1)(A) of this clause. Before licensing under this subparagraph (vi), DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65—”Appeals.”
                (vii) No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing by the contracting officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty income to effect such maintenance costs.
                (viii) At any time the Contractor abandons commercialization activities for data for which the Contractor has received permission to assert copyright in accordance with this clause, it shall advise OSTI and Patent Counsel and upon request assign the copyright to the Government so that the Government can distribute the data to the public.

                (4) The following notice may be placed on computer software prior to any publication and prior to the Contractor's obtaining permission from the Department of Energy to assert copyright in the computer software pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
                Notice: This computer software was prepared by [insert the Contractor's name and the individual author], hereinafter the Contractor, under Contract [insert the Contract Number] with the Department of Energy (DOE). All rights in the computer software are reserved by DOE on behalf of the United States Government and the Contractor as provided in the Contract. You are authorized to use this computer software for Governmental purposes but it is not to be released or distributed to the public. NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE CONTRACTOR MAKES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR ASSUMES ANY LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE. This notice including this sentence must appear on any copies of this computer software.
                (End of notice)
                (5) a similar notice can be used for data, other than computer software, upon approval of DOE Patent Counsel.
                (f) Subcontracting. (1) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the Contractor agrees to use in subcontracts in which technical data or computer software is expected to be produced or in subcontracts for supplies that contain a requirement for production or delivery of data in accordance with the policy and procedures of 48 CFR Subpart 27.4 as supplemented by 48 CFR 927.401 through 927.409, the clause entitled, “Rights in Data-General” at 48 CFR 52.227-14 modified in accordance with 927.409(a) and including Alternate V. Alternates II through IV of that clause may be included as appropriate with the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel, and the Contractor shall not acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software, except through the use of Alternates II or III, respectively, without the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel. The clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, shall be included in subcontracts in accordance with 48 CFR 927.409(h). The Contractor shall use instead the Rights in Data-Facilities clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1 in subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated under its contract with DOE.
                (2) It is the responsibility of the Contractor to obtain from its subcontractors technical data and computer software and rights therein, on behalf of the Government, necessary to fulfill the Contractor's obligations to the Government with respect to such data. In the event of refusal by a subcontractor to accept a clause affording the Government such rights, the Contractor shall:

(1) The Contractor shall establish and carry out its technology transfer efforts through appropriate organizational elements consistent with the requirements for an Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA) pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 11 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710). The costs associated with the conduct of technology transfer through the ORTA including activities associated with obtaining, maintaining, licensing, and assigning Intellectual Property rights, increasing the potential for the transfer of technology, widespread notice of technology transfer opportunities, and early stage and precommercial technology demonstration to remove barriers that limit private sector interest and demonstrate potential commercial applications of any research and technologies arising from Laboratory activities, shall be deemed allowable provided that such costs meet the other requirements of the allowable cost provisions of this Contract. In addition to any separately designated funds, these costs in any fiscal year shall not exceed an amount equal to 0.5 percent of the operating funds included in the Federal research and development budget (including Strategic Partnership Projects) of the Laboratory for that fiscal year without written approval of the contracting officer.
                (2) The Contractor's participation in litigation to enforce or defend Intellectual Property claims incurred in its technology transfer efforts shall be as provided in the clause entitled “Insurance—Litigation and Claims” of this contract.
                (d) Conflicts of Interest—Technology Transfer. The Contractor shall have implementing procedures that seek to avoid employee and organizational conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, in the conduct of its technology transfer activities. These procedures shall apply to other persons participating in Laboratory research or related technology transfer activities. Such implementing procedures shall be provided to the contracting officer for review and approval within sixty (60) days after execution of this contract. The contracting officer shall have thirty (30) days thereafter to approve or require specific changes to such procedures. Such implementing procedures shall include procedures to:
                (1) Inform employees of and require conformance with standards of conduct and integrity in connection with the CRADA activity in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (n)(5) of this clause;
                (2) Review and approve employee activities so as to avoid conflicts of interest arising from commercial utilization activities relating to Contractor-developed Intellectual Property;
                (3) Conduct work performed using royalties so as to avoid interference with or adverse effects on ongoing DOE projects and programs;
                (4) Conduct activities relating to commercial utilization of Contractor-developed Intellectual Property so as to avoid interference with or adverse effects on user facility or SPP activities of the Contractor;
                (5) Conduct DOE-funded projects and programs so as to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest or actual conflicts of interest with non-Government funded work;
                (6) Notify the contracting officer with respect to any new work to be performed or proposed to be performed under the Contract for DOE or other Federal agencies where the new work or proposal involves Intellectual Property in which the Contractor has obtained or intends to request or elect title;
                (7) Except as provided elsewhere in this Contract, obtain the approval of the contracting officer for any licensing of or assignment of title to Intellectual Property rights by the Contractor to any business or corporate affiliate of the Contractor;
                (8) Obtain the approval of the contracting officer prior to any assignment, exclusive licensing, or option for exclusive licensing, of Intellectual Property to any individual who has been a Laboratory employee within the previous two years or to the company in which the individual is a principal; and
                (9) Notify non-Federal sponsors of SPP activities, or non-Federal users of user facilities, of any relevant Intellectual Property interest of the Contractor prior to execution of SPPs or user agreements.

                (10) Notify DOE prior to evaluating a proposal by a third party or DOE, when the subject matter of the proposal involves an elected or waived subject invention under this contract or one in which the Contractor intends to elect to retain title under this contract.
                
                (e) Fairness of Opportunity. In conducting its technology transfer activities, the Contractor shall prepare procedures and take all reasonable measures to ensure widespread notice of availability of technologies suited for transfer and opportunities for exclusive licensing and joint research arrangements. The requirement to widely disseminate the availability of technology transfer opportunities does not apply to a specific application originated outside of the Laboratory and by entities other than the Contractor.
                (f) U.S. Industrial Competitiveness. (1) In the interest of enhancing U.S. Industrial Competitiveness, the Contractor shall, in its licensing and assignments of Intellectual Property, give preference in such a manner as to enhance the accrual of economic and technological benefits to the U.S. domestic economy. The Contractor shall consider the following factors in all of its licensing and assignment decisions involving Laboratory intellectual property where the Laboratory obtains rights during the course of the Contractor's operation of the Laboratory under this contract:
                (i) whether any resulting design and development will be performed in the United States and whether resulting products, embodying parts, including components thereof, will be substantially manufactured in the United States; or
                (ii) (A) whether the proposed licensee or assignee has a business unit located in the United States and whether significant economic and technical benefits will flow to the United States as a result of the license or assignment agreement; and
                (B) in licensing any entity subject to the control of a foreign company or government, whether such foreign government permits United States agencies, organizations or other persons to enter into cooperative research and development agreements and licensing agreements, and has policies to protect United States Intellectual Property rights.
                (2) If the Contractor determines that neither of the conditions in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this clause are likely to be fulfilled, the Contractor, prior to entering into such an agreement, must obtain the approval of the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall act on any such requests for approval within thirty (30) days.
                (3) The Contractor agrees to be bound by the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 204 (Preference for United States industry).
                (g) Indemnity—Product Liability. In entering into written technology transfer agreements, including but not limited to, research and development agreements, licenses, assignments and CRADAs, the Contractor agrees to include in such agreements a requirement that the U.S. Government and the Contractor, except for any negligent acts or omissions of the Contractor, be indemnified for all damages, costs, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising from personal injury or property damage occurring as a result of the making, using or selling of a product, process or service by or on behalf of the Participant, its assignees or licensees which was derived from the work performed under the agreement. The Contractor shall identify and obtain the approval of the contracting officer for any proposed exceptions to this requirement such as where State or local law expressly prohibit the Participant from providing indemnification or where the research results will be placed in the public domain.
                (h) Disposition of Income. (1) Royalties or other income earned or retained by the Contractor as a result of performance of authorized technology transfer activities herein shall be used by the Contractor for scientific research, development, technology transfer, and education at the Laboratory, consistent with the research and development mission and objectives of the Laboratory and subject to Section 12(b)(5) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710a(b)(5)) and Chapter 38 of the Patent Laws (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.) as amended through the effective date of this contract award or modification. If the net amounts of such royalties and income received from patent licensing after payment of patenting costs, licensing costs, payments to inventors and other expenses incidental to the administration of Subject Inventions during any fiscal year exceed 5 percent of the Laboratory's budget for that fiscal year, 75 percent of such excess amounts shall be paid to the Treasury of the United States, and the remaining amount of such excess shall be used by the Contractor for the purposes as described above in this paragraph. Any inventions arising out of such scientific research and development activities shall be deemed to be Subject Inventions under the Contract.
                (2) The Contractor shall include as a part of its annual Laboratory Institutional Plan or other such annual document a plan setting out those uses to which royalties and other income received as a result of performance of authorized technology transfer activities herein will be applied at the Laboratory, and at the end of the year, provide a separate accounting for how the funds were actually used. Under no circumstances shall these royalties and income be used for an illegal augmentation of funds furnished by the U.S. Government.
                (3) The Contractor shall establish subject to the approval of the contracting officer a policy for making awards or sharing of royalties with Contractor employees, other coinventors and coauthors, including Federal employee coinventors when deemed appropriate by the contracting officer.
                (i) Transfer to successor contractor. In the event of termination or upon the expiration of this Contract, any unexpended balance of income received for use at the Laboratory shall be transferred, at the contracting officer's request, to a successor contractor, or in the absence of a successor contractor, to such other entity as designated by the contracting officer. The Contractor shall transfer title, as one package, to the extent the Contractor retains title, in all patents and patent applications, licenses, accounts containing royalty revenues from such license agreements, including equity positions in third party entities, and other Intellectual Property rights which arose at the Laboratory, to the successor contractor or to the Government as directed by the contracting officer.
                (j) Technology transfer affecting the national security. (1) The Contractor shall notify and obtain the approval of the contracting officer, prior to entering into any technology transfer arrangement, when such technology or any part of such technology is classified or sensitive under Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2168). Such notification shall include sufficient information to enable DOE to determine the extent that commercialization of such technology would enhance or diminish security interests of the United States, or diminish communications within DOE's nuclear weapon production complex. DOE shall use its best efforts to complete its determination within sixty (60) days of the Contractor's notification, and provision of any supporting information, and DOE shall promptly notify the Contractor as to whether the technology is transferable.
                (2) The Contractor shall include in all of its technology transfer agreements with third parties, including, but not limited to, CRADAs, licensing agreements and assignments, notice to such third parties that the export of goods and/or Technical Data from the United States may require some form of export control license or other authority from the U.S. Government and that failure to obtain such export control license may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws.
                (3) For other than fundamental research as defined in National Security Decision Directive 189, the Contractor is responsible to conduct internal export control reviews and assure that technology is transferred in accordance with applicable law.
                (k) Records. The Contractor shall maintain records of its technology transfer activities in a manner and to the extent satisfactory to the DOE and specifically including, but not limited to, the licensing agreements, assignments and the records required to implement the requirements of paragraphs (e), (f), and (h) of this clause and shall provide reports to the contracting officer to enable DOE to maintain the reporting requirements of Section 12(c)(6) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710a(c)(6)). Such reports shall be made annually in a format to be agreed upon between the Contractor and DOE and in such a format which will serve to adequately inform DOE of the Contractor's technology transfer activities while protecting any data not subject to disclosure under the Rights in Technical Data clause and paragraph (n) of this clause. Such records shall be made available in accordance with the clauses of this Contract pertaining to inspection, audit and examination of records.
                (l) Reports to Congress. To facilitate DOE's reporting to Congress, the Contractor is required to submit annually to DOE a technology transfer plan for conducting its technology transfer function for the upcoming year, including plans for securing Intellectual Property rights in Laboratory innovations with commercial promise and plans for managing such innovations so as to benefit the competitiveness of United States industry. This plan shall be provided to the contracting officer on or before October 1st of each year.
                (m) Oversight and appraisal. The Contractor is responsible for developing and implementing effective internal controls for all technology transfer activities consistent with the audit and record requirements of this Contract. Laboratory Contractor performance in implementing the technology transfer mission and the effectiveness of the Contractor's procedures will be evaluated by the contracting officer as part of the annual appraisal process, with input from the cognizant Secretarial Officer or program office.
                (n) Technology transfer through cooperative research and development agreements. Upon approval of the contracting officer and as provided in a DOE approved Joint Work Statement (JWS), the Laboratory Director, or designee, may enter into CRADAs on behalf of the DOE subject to the requirements set forth in this paragraph.
                (1) Review and approval of CRADAs. (i) Except as otherwise directed in writing by the contracting officer, each JWS shall be submitted to the contracting officer for approval. The Contractor's Laboratory Director or designee shall provide a program mission impact statement and shall include an impact statement regarding related Intellectual Property rights known by the Contractor to be owned by the Government to assist the contracting officer in the approval determination.
                (ii) The Contractor shall also include (specific to the proposed CRADA), a statement of compliance with the Fairness of Opportunity requirements of paragraph (e) of this clause.

                (iii) Within thirty (30) days after submission of a JWS or proposed CRADA, the contracting officer shall approve, disapprove or request modification to the JWS or CRADA. The contracting officer shall provide a written explanation to the Contractor's Laboratory Director or designee of any disapproval or requirement for modification of a JWS or proposed CRADA.
                (iv) Except as otherwise directed in writing by the contracting officer, the Contractor shall not enter into, or begin work under, a CRADA until approval of the CRADA has been granted by the contracting officer. The Contractor may submit its proposed CRADA to the contracting officer at the time of submitting its proposed JWS or any time thereafter.
                (2) Selection of participants. The Contractor's Laboratory Director or designee in deciding what CRADA to enter into shall:
                (i) Give special consideration to small business firms, and consortia involving small business firms;
                (ii) Give preference to business units located in the United States which agree that products or processes embodying Intellectual Property will be substantially manufactured or practiced in the United States and, in the case of any industrial organization or other person subject to the control of a foreign company or government, take into consideration whether or not such foreign government permits United States agencies, organizations, or other persons to enter into cooperative research and development agreements and licensing agreements;
                (iii) Provide Fairness of Opportunity in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this clause; and
                (iv) Give consideration to the Conflicts of Interest requirements of paragraph (d) of this clause.
                (3) Withholding of data. (i) Data that is first produced as a result of research and development activities conducted under a CRADA and that would be a trade secret or commercial or financial data that would be privileged or confidential, if such data had been obtained from a non-Federal third party, may be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act as provided in the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710a(c)(7)) for a period as agreed in the CRADA of up to five (5)years from the time the data is first produced. The DOE shall cooperate with the Contractor in protecting such data.
                (ii) Unless otherwise expressly approved by the contracting officer in advance for a specific CRADA, the Contractor agrees, at the request of the contracting officer, to transmit such data to other DOE facilities for use by DOE or its Contractors by or on behalf of the Government. When data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause is so transferred, the Contractor shall clearly mark the data with a legend setting out the restrictions against private use and further dissemination, along with the expiration date of such restrictions.
                (iii) In addition to its authority to license Intellectual Property, the Contractor may enter into licensing agreements with third parties for data developed by the Contractor under a CRADA subject to other provisions of this Contract. However, the Contractor shall neither use the protection against dissemination nor the licensing of data as an alternative to the submittal of invention disclosures which include data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause.
                (4) Strategic Partnership Projects and user facility programs. (i) SPP and User Facility Agreements (UFAs) are not CRADAs and will be available for use by the Contractor in addition to CRADAs for achieving utilization of employee expertise and unique facilities for maximizing technology transfer. The Contractor agrees form prospective CRADA participants, which are intending to substantially pay full cost recovery for the effort under a proposed CRADA, of the availability of alternative forms of agreements, i.e., SPP and UFA, and of the Class Patent Waiver provisions associated therewith.
                (ii) Where the Contractor believes that the transfer of technology to the U.S. domestic economy will benefit from, or other equity considerations dictate, an arrangement other than the Class Waiver of patent rights to the sponsor in SPP and UFAs, a request may be made to the contracting officer for an exception to the Class Waivers.
                (iii) Rights to inventions made under agreements other than funding agreements with third parties shall be governed by the appropriate provisions incorporated, with DOE approval, in such agreements, and the provisions in such agreements take precedence over any disposition of rights contained in this Contract. Disposition of rights under any such agreement shall be in accordance with any DOE class waiver (including Strategic Partnership Projects and User Class Waivers) or individually negotiated waiver which applies to the agreement.
                (5) Conflicts of interest. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (n)(5)(iii) of this clause, the Contractor shall assure that no employee of the Contractor shall have a substantial role (including an advisory role) in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of a CRADA, if, to such employee's knowledge:
                (A) Such employee, or the spouse, child, parent, sibling, or partner of such employee, or an organization (other than the Contractor) in which such employee serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee—
                (1) Holds financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of the CRADA;
                (2) Receives a gift or gratuity from any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of the CRADA; or
                
                (B) A financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of the CRADA, is held by any person or organization with whom such employee is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment.
                (ii) The Contractor shall require that each employee of the Contractor who has a substantial role (including an advisory role) in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of a CRADA certify through the Contractor to the contracting officer that the circumstances described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause do not apply to that employee.
                (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (n)(5)(i) and (n)(5)(ii) of this clause shall not apply in a case where the contracting officer is advised by the Contractor in advance of the participation of an employee described in those paragraphs in the preparation, negotiation or approval of a CRADA of the nature of and extent of any financial interest described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause, and the contracting officer determines that such financial interest is not so substantial as to be considered likely to affect the integrity of the Contractor employee's participation in the process of preparing, negotiating, or approving the CRADA.
                (o) Technology transfer in other cost-sharing agreements. In conducting research and development activities in cost-shared agreements not covered by paragraph (n) of this clause, the Contractor, with prior written permission of the contracting officer, may provide for the withholding of data produced thereunder in accordance with the applicable provisions of paragraph (n)(3) of this clause.
              
              (End of clause)

                (b) Allocation of Principal Rights. (1) Retention of title by the Contractor. Except for exceptional circumstance subject inventions, the contractor may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the Contractor retains title, the Federal government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world.
                (2) Exceptional circumstance subject inventions. Except to the extent that rights are retained by the Contractor in a determination of exceptional circumstances or granted to a contractor through a determination of greater rights in accordance with subparagraph (b)(4) of this clause, the Contractor does not have a right to retain title to any exceptional circumstance subject inventions and agrees to assign to the Government the entire right, title, and interest, throughout the world, in and to any exceptional circumstance subject inventions.

                (3) Treaties and international agreements. Any rights acquired by the Contractor in subject inventions are subject to any disposition of right, title, or interest in or to subject inventions provided for in treaties or international agreements identified at Appendix [Insert Reference] to this contract. DOE reserves the right to unilaterally amend this contract to identify specific treaties or international agreements entered into or to be entered into by the Government after the effective date of this contract and to effectuate those license or other rights which are necessary for the Government to meet its obligations to foreign governments, their nationals and international organizations under such treaties or international agreements with respect to subject inventions made after the date of the amendment.
                (4) Contractor request for greater rights in exceptional circumstance subject inventions. The Contractor may request rights greater than allowed by the exceptional circumstance determination in an exceptional circumstance subject invention by submitting such a request in writing to Patent Counsel at the time the exceptional circumstance subject invention is disclosed to DOE or within eight (8) months after conception or first actual reduction to practice of the exceptional circumstance subject invention, whichever occurs first, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Patent Counsel for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. DOE may, in its discretion, grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor.
                (5) Contractor employee-inventor rights. If the Contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention or does not request greater rights in an exceptional circumstance subject invention, a Contractor employee-inventor, after consultation with the Contractor and with written authorization from the Contractor in accordance with 10 CFR 784.9(b)(4), may request greater rights, including title, in the subject invention or the exceptional circumstance invention from DOE, and DOE may, in its discretion, grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor employee-inventor.
                (6) Government assignment of rights in Government employees' subject inventions. If a Government employee is a joint inventor of a subject invention or of an exceptional circumstance subject invention to which the Contractor has rights, the Government may assign or refuse to assign to the Contractor any rights in the subject invention or exceptional circumstance subject invention acquired by the Government from the Government employee, in accordance with 48 CFR 27.304-1(d). The rights assigned to the Contractor are subject to any provision of this clause that is applicable to subject inventions in which the Contractor retains title, including reservation by the Government of a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license, except that the Contractor shall file its initial patent application claiming the subject invention or exceptional circumstance invention within one (1) year after the assignment of such rights. The Contractor shall share royalties collected for the manufacture, use or sale of the subject invention with the Government employee.
                (c) Subject invention disclosure, election of title and filing of patent application by contractor—(1) Subject invention disclosure. The contractor will disclose each subject invention to the Patent Counsel within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s) and all sources of funding by B&R code for the invention. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. The disclosure shall include a written statement as to whether the invention falls within an exceptional circumstance field. DOE will make a determination and advise the Contractor within 30 days of receipt of an invention disclosure as to whether the invention is an exceptional circumstance subject invention. In addition, after disclosure to the Patent Counsel, the Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the contractor. The Contractor shall obtain approval from Patent Counsel prior to any release or publication of information concerning any nonelectable subject invention such as an exceptional circumstance subject invention or any subject invention related to a treaty or international agreement.
                (2) Election by the Contractor. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying the Federal agency within two years of disclosure to the Federal agency. However, in any case where publication, on sale or public use has initiated the one year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.
                (3) Filing of patent applications by the Contractor. The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, or prior to the end of any 1-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent application or six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
                (4) Contractor's request for an extension of time. Requests for an extension of the time for disclosure, election, and filing under subparagraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) may, at the discretion of Patent Counsel, be granted.
                (5) Publication approval. During the course of the work under this contract, the Contractor or its employees may desire to release or publish information regarding scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract. In order that public disclosure of such information will not adversely affect the patent interest of DOE or the Contractor, approval for release or publication shall be secured from the Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters prior to any such release or publication. Where DOE's approval of publication is requested, DOE's response to such requests for approval shall normally be provided within 90 days except in circumstances in which a domestic patent application must be filed in order to protect foreign rights. In the case involving foreign patent rights, DOE shall be granted an additional 180 days with which to respond to the request for approval, unless extended by mutual agreement.
                (d) Conditions when the Government may obtain title. The Contractor will convey to the DOE, upon written request, title to any subject invention—
                (1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain title; provided, that DOE may only request title within sixty (60) days after learning of the failure of the Contractor to disclose or to elect within the specified times.
                (2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a patent application within the times specified in subparagraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in subparagraph (c) above, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the DOE, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country.
                (3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.
                (4) If the Contractor requests that DOE acquire title or rights from the Contractor in a subject invention to which the Contractor had initially retained title or rights, or in an exceptional circumstance subject invention to which the Contractor was granted greater rights, DOE may acquire such title or rights from the Contractor, or DOE may decide against acquiring such title or rights from the Contractor, at DOE's sole discretion.
                (e) Minimum rights of the Contractor and protection of the Contractor's right to file—(1) Request for a Contractor license. The Contractor may request the right to reserve a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. DOE may grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. When DOE approves such reservation, the Contractor's license will normally extend to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
                (2) Revocation or modification of a Contractor license. The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR Part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR Part 781. This license will not be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application of the subject invention in that foreign country.
                (3) Notice of revocation of modification of a Contractor license. Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.
                (f) Contractor action to protect the Government's interest—(1) Execution of delivery of title or license instruments. The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed, and promptly deliver to the Patent Counsel all instruments necessary to accomplish the following actions:
                (i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title, and
                (ii) Convey title to DOE when requested under subparagraphs (b) or paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.
                (2) Contractor employee agreements. The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to Contractor personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each subject invention made under this contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
                (3) Notification of discontinuation of patent protection. The contractor will notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than thirty days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.
                (4) Notification of Government rights. The contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent applications and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the Federal agency). The government has certain rights in the invention.”
                (5) Invention identification procedures. The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to ensure that subject inventions are promptly identified and timely disclosed and shall submit a written description of such procedures to the Contracting Officer so that the Contracting Officer may evaluate and determine their effectiveness.
                (6) Invention filing documentation. If the Contractor files a domestic or foreign patent application claiming a subject invention, the Contractor shall promptly submit to Patent Counsel, upon request, the following information and documents:
                (i) The filing date, serial number, title, and a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English);
                (ii) An executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all Government rights in the subject invention; and
                (iii) The patent number, issue date, and a copy of any issued patent claiming the subject invention.
                (7) Duplication and disclosure of documents. The Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause; provided, however, that any such duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject to the confidentiality provision at 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR part 40.
                (g) Subcontracts—(1) Subcontractor subject inventions. The Contractor shall not obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions as part of the consideration for awarding a subcontract.
                (2) Inclusion of patent rights clause—non-profit organization or small business firm subcontractors. Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, at any tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except subcontracts which are subject to exceptional circumstances in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202 and subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause. The subcontractor retains all rights provided for the contractor in the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11.
                (3) Inclusion of patent rights clause—subcontractors other than non-profit organizations and small business firms. Except for the subcontracts described in subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, suitably modified to identify the parties, in any contract for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work. For subcontracts subject to exceptional circumstances, the contractor must consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent clause.
                (4) DOE and subcontractor contract. With respect to subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.
                (5) Subcontractor refusal to accept terms of patent clause. If a prospective subcontractor refuses to accept the terms of a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer stating the subcontractor's reasons for such a refusal, including any relevant information for expediting disposition of the matter, and the Contractor shall not proceed with the subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.
                (6) Notification of award of subcontract. Upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of a subcontract.
                (7) Identification of subcontractor subject inventions. If the Contractor in the performance of this contract becomes aware of a subject invention made under a subcontract, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel and identify the subject invention.
                (h) Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor agrees to submit to DOE on request, periodic reports, no more frequently than annually, on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.
                (i) Preference for United States Industry. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
                (j) March-in Rights. The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any DOE supplemental regulations to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that—
                (1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;
                (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees;
                (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
                (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived, or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.

                (viii) The identification of any agreement relating to the subject invention, including Cooperative Research and Development Agreements and Strategic Partnership Projects agreements.
                Unless the Contractor contends otherwise in writing at the time the invention is disclosed, inventions disclosed to DOE under this paragraph are deemed made in the manner specified in Sections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 42 U.S.C. 5908.
                (2) Publication after disclosure. After disclosure of the subject invention to the DOE, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel of the acceptance for publication of any manuscript describing the subject invention or of any expected or on sale or public use of the subject invention, known by the Contractor. The Contractor shall obtain approval from Patent Counsel prior to any release or publication of information concerning an exceptional circumstance subject invention or any subject invention related to a treaty or international agreement.
                (3) Election by the Contractor under an advance class waiver. If the Contractor has the right to elect to retain title to subject inventions under an advance class waiver granted in accordance with subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause, and unless otherwise provided for by the terms of the advance class waiver, the Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any subject invention by notifying DOE within two (2) years of the date of the disclosure of the subject invention to DOE, in accordance with subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The notification shall identify the advance class waiver, state the countries, including the United States, in which rights are retained, and certify that the subject invention is not an exceptional circumstance subject invention or subject to a treaty or international agreement. If a publication, on sale or public use of the subject invention has initiated the 1-year statutory period under 35 U.S.C. 102(b), the period for election may be shortened by DOE to a date that is no more than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the 1-year statutory period.
                (4) Filing of patent applications by the Contractor under an advance class waiver. If the Contractor has the right to retain title to a subject invention in accordance with an advance class waiver pursuant to subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause or a determination of greater rights pursuant to paragraph (b)(7) of this clause, and unless otherwise provided for by the terms of the advance class waiver or greater rights determination, the Contractor shall file an initial patent application claiming the subject invention to which it retains title either within one (1) year after the Contractor's election to retain or grant of title to the subject invention or prior to the end of any 1-year statutory period under 35 U.S.C. 102(b), whichever occurs first. Any patent applications filed by the Contractor in foreign countries or international patent offices shall be filed within either ten (10) months of the corresponding initial patent application or, if such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order, within six (6) months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications.
                (5) Submission of patent information and documents. If the Contractor files a domestic or foreign patent application claiming a subject invention, the Contractor shall promptly submit to Patent Counsel the following information and documents:
                (i) The filing date, serial number, title, and a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English);
                (ii) An executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all Government rights in the subject invention; and
                (iii) The patent number, issue date, and a copy of any issued patent claiming the subject invention.
                (6) Contractor's request for an extension of time. Requests for an extension of the time to disclose a subject invention, to elect to retain title to a subject invention, or to file a patent application under subparagraphs (c)(1), (3), and (4) of this clause may be granted at the discretion of Patent Counsel or DOE.
                (7) Duplication and disclosure of documents. The Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause; provided, however, that any such duplication or disclosure by the Government is subject to 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR part 40.
                (d) Conditions when the Government may obtain title notwithstanding an advance class waiver—(1) Return of title to a subject invention. If the Contractor requests that DOE acquire title or rights from the Contractor in a subject invention, including an exceptional circumstance subject invention, to which the Contractor retained title or rights under subparagraph (b)(2) or subparagraph (b)(7) of this clause, DOE may acquire such title or rights from the Contractor, or DOE may decide against acquiring such title or rights from the Contractor, at DOE's sole discretion.
                (2) Failure to disclose or elect to retain title. Title vests in DOE and DOE may request, in writing, a formal assignment of title to a subject invention from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject invention to DOE, if the Contractor elects not to retain title to the subject invention under an advance class waiver, or the Contractor fails to disclose or fails to elect to retain title to the subject invention within the times specified in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this clause.
                (3) Failure to file domestic or foreign patent applications. In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a patent application within the times specified in subparagraph (c)(4) of this clause, DOE may request, in writing, title to the subject invention from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject invention to DOE; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application in any country after the times specified in subparagraph (c)(4) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of DOE's written request for title, the Contractor continues to retain title in that country.
                (4) Discontinuation of patent protection by the Contractor. If the Contractor decides to discontinue the prosecution of a patent application, the payment of maintenance fees, or the defense of a subject invention in a reexamination or opposition proceeding, in any country, DOE may request, in writing, title to the subject invention from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject invention to DOE.
                (5) Termination of advance class waiver. DOE may request, in writing, title to any subject inventions from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject inventions to DOE, if the advance class waiver granted under subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause is terminated under paragraph (u) of this clause.
                (e) Minimum rights of the Contractor—(1) Request for a Contractor license. Except for subject inventions that the Contractor fails to disclose within the time periods specified at subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause, the Contractor may request a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country claiming a subject invention and any resulting patent in which the Government obtains title, and DOE may grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. If DOE grants the Contractor's request for a license, the Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded.
                (2) Transfer of a Contractor license. DOE shall approve any transfer of the Contractor's license in a subject invention, and DOE may determine that the Contractor's license is non-transferrable, on a case-by-case basis.
                (3) Revocation or modification of a Contractor license. DOE may revoke or modify the Contractor's domestic license to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions in 37 CFR Part 404 and DOE licensing regulations. DOE may not revoke the Contractor's domestic license in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor, its licensees or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have achieved practical applications and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. DOE may revoke or modify the Contractor's license in any foreign country to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
                (4) Notice of revocation or modification of a Contractor license. Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the date of the notice (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations.
                (f) Contractor action to protect the Government's interest—(1) Execution and delivery of title or license instruments. The Contractor agrees to execute or have executed, and to deliver promptly to DOE all instruments necessary to accomplish the following actions:
                (i) Establish or confirm the Government's rights throughout the world in subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title;
                (ii) Convey title in a subject invention to DOE pursuant to subparagraph (b)(5) and paragraph (d) of this clause; or
                (iii) Enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in a subject invention to which the Government has title.
                (2) Contractor employee agreements. The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to Contractor personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each subject invention made under this contract, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications claiming subject inventions or to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format shall at a minimum include the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
                (3) Contractor procedures for reporting subject inventions to DOE. The Contractor agrees to establish and maintain effective procedures for ensuring the prompt identification and timely disclosure of subject inventions to DOE. The Contractor shall submit a written description of such procedures to the Contracting Officer, upon request, for evaluation and approval of the effectiveness of such procedures by the Contracting Officer.
                (4) Notification of discontinuation of patent protection. With respect to any subject invention for which the Contractor has responsibility for patent prosecution, the Contractor shall notify Patent Counsel of any decision to discontinue the prosecution of a patent application, payment of maintenance fees, or defense of a subject invention in a reexamination or opposition proceeding, in any country, not less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the response period for any action required by the corresponding patent office.
                (5) Notification of Government rights. With respect to any subject invention to which the Contractor has title, the Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and within any patent issuing thereon claiming a subject invention, the following statement, “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.”
                (6) Avoidance of royalty charges. If the Contractor licenses a subject invention, the Contractor agrees to avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government funds, including funds derived through a Military Assistance Program of the Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund any amounts received as royalty charges on a subject invention in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for such refund in any instrument transferring rights in the subject invention to any party.
                (7) DOE approval of assignment of rights. Rights in a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned by the Contractor without the approval of DOE.
                (8) Small business firm licensees. The Contractor shall make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and may give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision as to whether to give a preference in any specific case is at the discretion of the Contractor.
                (9) Contractor licensing of subject inventions. To the extent that it provides the most effective technology transfer, licensing of subject inventions shall be administered by Contractor employees on location at the facility.
                (g) Subcontracts—(1) Subcontractor subject inventions. The Contractor shall not obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions as part of the consideration for awarding a subcontract.
                (2) Inclusion of patent rights clause—non-profit organization or small business firm subcontractors. Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, at any tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except subcontracts which are subject to exceptional circumstances in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202 and subparagraph (b)(5) of this clause.
                (3) Inclusion of patent rights clause—subcontractors other than non-profit organizations or small business firms. Except for the subcontracts described in subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, suitably modified to identify the parties and any applicable exceptional circumstance, in any contract for experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work.
                (4) DOE and subcontractor contract. With respect to subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by this clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.
                (5) Subcontractor refusal to accept terms of patent rights clause. If a prospective subcontractor refuses to accept the terms of a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer stating the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and including relevant information for expediting disposition of the matter; and the Contractor shall not proceed with the subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.
                (6) Notification of award of subcontract. Upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of a subcontract.
                (7) Identification of subcontractor subject inventions. If the Contractor in the performance of this contract becomes aware of a subject invention made under a subcontract, the Contractor shall promptly notify Patent Counsel and identify the subject invention, with a copy of the notification and identification to the Contracting Officer.
                (h) Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. Upon request by DOE, the Contractor agrees to submit periodic reports, no more frequently than annually, describing the utilization of a subject invention or efforts made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees to obtain utilization of the subject invention. The reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and other data and information reasonably specified by DOE. Upon request by DOE, the Contractor also agrees to provide reports in connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by DOE, in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. If any data or information reported by the Contractor in accordance with this provision is considered privileged and confidential by the Contractor, its licensee, or assignee and the Contractor properly marks the data or information privileged or confidential, DOE agrees not to disclose such information to persons outside the Government, to the extent permitted by law.
                (i) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause the Contractor agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which it retains title, neither it nor any assignee may grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, DOE may waive the requirement for such an agreement upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
                (j) March-In rights. With respect to any subject invention to which the Contractor has elected to retain or is granted title, DOE may, in accordance with the procedures in the DOE patent waiver regulations, require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that—
                (1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;
                (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs that are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their licensees;
                (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by government regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
                (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement to substantially manufacture in the United States and required by paragraph (i) of this clause has neither been obtained nor waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
                (k) Communications. The Contractor shall direct any notification, disclosure, or request provided for in this clause to the Patent Counsel identified in the contract.
                (l) Reports—(1) Interim reports. Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, no more frequently than annually, a list of subject inventions disclosed to DOE during a specified period, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the specified period; and/or a list of subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during a specified period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the specified period. The interim report shall state whether the Contractor's invention disclosures were submitted to DOE in accordance with the requirements of subparagraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) of this clause.
                (2) Final reports. Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit to DOE, prior to closeout of the contract or within three (3) months of the date of completion of the contracted work, a list of all subject inventions disclosed during the performance period of the contract, or a statement that no subject inventions were made during the contract performance period; and/or a list of all subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during the contract performance period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the contract performance period.
                (m) Facilities License. In addition to the rights of the parties with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice or acquired by the contractor at any time through completion of this contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or which cover articles, materials, or products manufactured at the facility (1) to practice or have practiced by or for the Government at the facility, and (2) to transfer such license with the transfer of that facility. Notwithstanding the acceptance or exercise by the Government of these rights, the Government may contest at any time the enforceability, validity or scope of, or title to, any rights or patents herein licensed.
                (n) Atomic energy—(1) Pecuniary awards. No claim for pecuniary award of compensation under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, may be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived in the course of or under this contract.

                Insurance—Litigation and Claims (JUL 2013)
                (a) The contractor must comply with 10 CFR part 719, Contractor Legal Management Requirements, if applicable.
                (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the contractor shall procure and maintain such bonds and insurance as required by law or approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.
                (2) The contractor may, with the approval of the Contracting Officer, maintain a self-insurance program in accordance with FAR 28.308; provided that, with respect to workers' compensation, the contractor is qualified pursuant to statutory authority.
                (3) All bonds and insurance required by this clause shall be in a form and amount and for those periods as the Contracting Officer may require or approve and with sureties and insurers approved by the Contracting Officer.
                (c) The contractor agrees to submit for the Contracting Officer's approval, to the extent and in the manner required by the Contracting Officer, any other bonds and insurance that are maintained by the contractor in connection with the performance of this contract and for which the contractor seeks reimbursement. If an insurance cost (whether a premium for commercial insurance or related to self-insurance) includes a portion covering costs made unallowable elsewhere in the contract, and the share of the cost for coverage for the unallowable cost is determinable, the portion of the cost that is otherwise an allowable cost under this contract is reimbursable to the extent determined by the Contracting Officer.
                (d) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this clause, or specifically disallowed elsewhere in this contract, the contractor shall be reimbursed—
                (1) For that portion of the reasonable cost of bonds and insurance allocable to this contract required in accordance with contract terms or approved under this clause, and
                (2) For liabilities (and reasonable expenses incidental to such liabilities, including litigation costs) to third persons not compensated by insurance without regard to the clause of this contract entitled “Obligation of Funds.”
                (e) The Government's liability under paragraph (d) of this clause is subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Nothing in this contract shall be construed as implying that the Congress will, at a later date, appropriate funds sufficient to meet deficiencies.

                (f)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, the contractor shall not be reimbursed for liabilities to third parties, including contractor employees, and directly associated costs which may include but are not limited to litigation costs, counsel fees, judgments and settlements—
                (i) Which are otherwise unallowable by law or the provisions of this contract, including the cost reimbursement limitations contained in 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by 48 CFR 970.31;
                (ii) For which the contractor has failed to insure or to maintain insurance as required by law, this contract, or by the written direction of the Contracting Officer; or
                (iii) Which were caused by contractor managerial personnel's—
                (A) Willful misconduct;
                (B) Lack of good faith; or
                (C) Failure to exercise prudent business judgment, which means failure to act in the same manner as a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business; or, in the case of a non-profit educational institution, failure to act in the manner that a prudent person would under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision to incur the cost is made.
                (2) The term “contractor's managerial personnel” is defined in the Property clause in this contract.
                (g)(1) All litigation costs, including counsel fees, judgments and settlements shall be segregated and accounted for by the contractor separately. If the Contracting Officer provisionally disallows such costs, then the contractor may not use funds advanced by DOE under the contract to finance the litigation.
                (2) Punitive damages are not allowable unless the act or failure to act which gave rise to the liability resulted from compliance with specific terms and conditions of the contract or written instructions from the Contracting Officer.
                (3) The portion of the cost of insurance obtained by the contractor that is allocable to coverage of liabilities referred to in paragraph (f) of this clause is not allowable.
                (h) The contractor may at its own expense and not as an allowable cost procure for its own protection insurance to compensate the contractor for any unallowable or non-reimbursable costs incurred in connection with contract performance.

              State and local taxes.
              As prescribed in 970.2904-1(b), insert the following clause in management and operating contracts. The requirement for the notice prescribed in paragraph (a) of the clause may be broadened to include all State and local taxes which may be claimed as allowable costs when considered to be appropriate.
              
                State and Local Taxes (DEC 2000)
                (a) The Contractor agrees to notify the Contracting Officer of any State or local tax, fee, or charge levied or purported to be levied on or collected from the Contractor with respect to the contract work, any transaction thereunder, or property in the custody or control of the Contractor and constituting an allowable item of cost if due and payable, but which the Contractor has reason to believe, or the Contracting Officer has advised the Contractor, is or may be inapplicable or invalid; and the Contractor further agrees to refrain from paying any such tax, fee, or charge unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. Any State or local tax, fee, or charge paid with the approval of the Contracting Officer or on the basis of advice from the Contracting Officer that such tax, fee, or charge is applicable and valid, and which would otherwise be an allowable item of cost, shall not be disallowed as an item of cost by reason of any subsequent ruling or determination that such tax, fee, or charge was in fact inapplicable or invalid.
                (b) The Contractor agrees to take such action as may be required or approved by the Contracting Officer to cause any State or local tax, fee, or charge which would be an allowable cost to be paid under protest; and to take such action as may be required or approved by the Contracting Officer to seek recovery of any payments made, including assignment to the Government or its designee of all rights to an abatement or refund thereof, and granting permission for the Government to join with the Contractor in any proceedings for the recovery thereof or to sue for recovery in the name of the Contractor. If the Contracting Officer directs the Contractor to institute litigation to enjoin the collection of or to recover payment of any such tax, fee, or charge referred to above, or if a claim or suit is filed against the Contractor for a tax, fee, or charge it has refrained from paying in accordance with this clause, the procedures and requirements of the clause entitled “Insurance—Litigation and Claims” shall apply and the costs and expenses incurred by the Contractor shall be allowable items of costs, as provided in this contract, together with the amount of any judgment rendered against the Contractor.
                (c) The Government shall hold the Contractor harmless from penalties and interest incurred through compliance with this clause. All recoveries or credits in respect of the foregoing taxes, fees, and charges (including interest) shall inure to and be for the sole benefit of the Government.

                Preexisting Conditions (DEC 2000)
                (a) The Department of Energy agrees to reimburse the Contractor, and the Contractor shall not be held responsible, for any liability (including without limitation, a claim involving strict or absolute liability and any civil fine or penalty), expense, or remediation cost, but limited to those of a civil nature, which may be incurred by, imposed on, or asserted against the Contractor arising out of any condition, act, or failure to act which occurred before the Contractor assumed responsibility on [Insert date contract began]. To the extent the acts or omissions of the Contractor cause or add to any liability, expense or remediation cost resulting from conditions in existence prior to [Insert date contract began], the Contractor shall be responsible in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.
                (b) The obligations of the Department of Energy under this clause are subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

                (c) The Contractor has the duty to inspect the facilities and sites and timely identify to the Contracting Officer those conditions which it believes could give rise to a liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, fine, claim, action, suit, cost, expense, or disbursement or areas of actual or potential noncompliance with the terms and conditions of this contract or applicable law or regulation. The Contractor has the responsibility to take corrective action, as directed by the Contracting Officer and as required elsewhere in this contract.

                Reduction or Suspension of Advance, Partial, or Progress Payments (DEC 2000)
                (a) The Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend further advance, partial, or progress payments to the Contractor upon a written determination by the Senior Procurement Executive that substantial evidence exists that the Contractor's request for advance, partial, or progress payment is based on fraud.
                (b) The Contractor shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond in writing.

              Payments and advances.
              As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1), insert the following clause:
              
                Payments and Advances (DEC 2000)
                (a) Installments of fixed-fee. The fixed-fee payable under this contract shall become due and payable in periodic installments in accordance with a schedule determined by the Contracting Officer. Fixed-fee payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn from funds advanced or available under this contract, as determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may offset against any such fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the Contractor, including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No fixed-fee payment may be withdrawn against the payments cleared financing arrangement without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.
                (b) Payments on Account of Allowable Costs. The Contracting Officer and the Contractor shall agree as to the extent to which payment for allowable costs or payments for other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer (for example, negotiated fixed amounts) shall be made from advances of Government funds. When pension contributions are paid by the Contractor to the retirement fund less frequently than quarterly, accrued costs therefore shall be excluded from costs for payment purposes until such costs are paid. If pension contribution are paid on a quarterly or more frequent basis, accrual therefore may be included in costs for payment purposes, provided that they are paid to the fund within 30 days after the close of the period covered. If payments are not made to the fund within such 30-day period, pension contribution costs shall be excluded from cost for payment purposes until payment has been made.
                (c) Special financial institution account—use. All advances of Government funds shall be withdrawn pursuant to a payments cleared financing arrangement prescribed by DOE in favor of the financial institution or, at the option of the Government, shall be made by direct payment or other payment mechanism to the Contractor, and shall be deposited only in the special financial institution account referred to in the Special Financial Institution Account Agreement, which is incorporated into this contract as Appendix—. No part of the funds in the special financial institution account shall be commingled with any funds of the Contractor or used for a purpose other than that of making payments for costs allowable and, if applicable, fees earned under this contract, negotiated fixed amounts, or payments for other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer determines that the balance of such special financial institution account exceeds the Contractor's current needs, the Contractor shall promptly make such disposition of the excess as the Contracting Officer may direct.
                (d) Title to funds advanced. Title to the unexpended balance of any funds advanced and of any special financial institution account established pursuant to this clause shall remain in the Government and be superior to any claim or lien of the financial institution of deposit or others. It is understood that an advance to the Contractor hereunder is not a loan to the Contractor, and will not require the payment of interest by the Contractor, and that the Contractor acquires no right, title or interest in or to such advance other than the right to make expenditures therefrom, as provided in this clause.
                (e) Financial settlement. The Government shall promptly pay to the Contractor the unpaid balance of allowable costs (or other items specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer) and fee upon termination of the work, expiration of the term of the contract, or completion of the work and its acceptance by the Government after—
                (1) Compliance by the Contractor with DOE's patent clearance requirements; and
                (2) The furnishing by the Contractor of—
                (i) An assignment of the Contractor's rights to any refunds, rebates, allowances, accounts receivable, collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, or other credits applicable to allowable costs under the contract;
                (ii) A closing financial statement;
                (iii) The accounting for Government-owned property required by the clause entitled “Property”; and
                (iv) A release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract subject only to the following exceptions—
                (A) Specified claims in stated amounts or in estimated amounts where the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor;
                (B) Claims, together with reasonable expenses incidental thereto, based upon liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of the performance of this contract; provided that such claims are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release; and provided further that the Contractor gives notice of such claims in writing to the Contracting Officer promptly, but not more than one (1) year after the Contractor's right of action first accrues. In addition, the Contractor shall provide prompt notice to the Contracting Officer of all potential claims under this clause, whether in litigation or not (see Contract Clause, 48 CFR 970.5228-1, Insurance—Litigation and Claims);
                (C) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of any indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable expenses incidental thereto, incurred by the Contractor under the provisions of this contract relating to patents; and
                (D) Claims recognizable under the clause entitled, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity Agreement.
                (3) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, there shall be deducted—
                (i) Any claim which the Government may have against the Contractor in connection with this contract; and
                (ii) Deductions due under the terms of this contract and not otherwise recovered by or credited to the Government. The unliquidated balance of the special financial institution account may be applied to the amount due and any balance shall be returned to the Government forthwith.
                (f) Claims. Claims for credit against funds advanced for payment shall be accompanied by such supporting documents and justification as the Contracting Officer shall prescribe.
                (g) Discounts. The Contractor shall take and afford the Government the advantage of all known and available cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, and commissions unless the Contracting Officer finds that action is not in the best interest of the Government.
                (h) Collections. All collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, except for the Contractor's fee and royalties or other income accruing to the Contractor from technology transfer activities in accordance with this contract, shall be Government property and shall be processed and accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements imposed by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract and, to the extent consistent with those requirements, shall be deposited in the special financial institution account or otherwise made available for payment of allowable costs under this contract, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer.
                (i) Direct payment of charges. The Government reserves the right, upon ten days written notice from the Contracting Officer to the Contractor, to pay directly to the persons concerned, all amounts due which otherwise would be allowable under this contract. Any payment so made shall discharge the Government of all liability to the Contractor therefore.
                (j) Determining allowable costs. The Contracting Officer shall determine allowable costs in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 31.2 and the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation subpart 48 CFR 970.31 in effect on the date of this contract and other provisions of this contract.

                Alternate I (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(i), if a separate fixed-fee is provided for a separate item of work, paragraph (a) of the basic clause should be modified to permit payment of the entire fixed-fee upon completion of that item.
              
              
                Alternate II (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(ii), when total available fee provisions are used, replace paragraph (a) of the basic clause with the following paragraph (a):
              
              
                (a) Payment of Total available fee: Base Fee and Performance Fee. The base fee amount, if any, is payable in equal monthly installments. Total available fee amount earned is payable following the Government's Determination of Total Available Fee Amount Earned in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount.” Base fee amount and total available fee amount earned payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn from funds advanced or available under this contract, as determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may offset against any such fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the Contractor, including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No base fee amount or total available fee amount earned payment may be withdrawn against the payments cleared financing arrangement without the prior written approval of the contracting officer.
              
              
              
                Alternate III (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(1)(iii), the following paragraph (k) shall be included in management and operating contracts with integrated accounting systems:
              
              
                (k) Review and approval of costs incurred. The Contractor shall prepare and submit annually as of September 30, a “Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed” (Cost Statement) for the total of net expenditures accrued (i.e., net costs incurred) for the period covered by the Cost Statement. The Contractor shall certify the Cost Statement subject to the penalty provisions for unallowable costs as stated in sections 306(b) and (i) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 256), as amended. DOE, after audit and appropriate adjustment, will approve such Cost Statement. This approval by DOE will constitute an acknowledgment by DOE that the net costs incurred are allowable under the contract and that they have been recorded in the accounts maintained by the Contractor in accordance with DOE accounting policies, but will not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for DOE's assets in its care, for appropriate subsequent adjustments, or for errors later becoming known to DOE.

It is anticipated that this will be an annual submission unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall certify the Cost Statement subject to the penalty provisions for unallowable costs as stated in sections 306(b) and (i) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 256), as amended.

                Accounts, Records, and Inspection (DEC 2010)
                (a) Accounts. The Contractor shall maintain a separate and distinct set of accounts, records, documents, and other evidence showing and supporting: all allowable costs incurred; collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, other applicable credits, negotiated fixed amounts, and fee accruals under this contract; and the receipt, use, and disposition of all Government property coming into the possession of the Contractor under this contract.

                (c) Audit of subcontractors' records. The Contractor also agrees, with respect to any subcontracts (including fixed-price or unit-price subcontracts or purchase orders) where, under the terms of the subcontract, costs incurred are a factor in determining the amount payable to the subcontractor of any tier, to either conduct an audit of the subcontractor's costs or arrange for such an audit to be performed by the cognizant government audit agency through the Contracting Officer.
                (d) Disposition of records. Except as agreed upon by the Government and the Contractor, all financial and cost reports, books of account and supporting documents, system files, data bases, and other data evidencing costs allowable, collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract, other applicable credits, and fee accruals under this contract, shall be the property of the Government, and shall be delivered to the Government or otherwise disposed of by the Contractor either as the Contracting Officer may from time to time direct during the progress of the work or, in any event, as the Contracting Officer shall direct upon completion or termination of this contract and final audit of accounts hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in this contract, including provisions of Clause 970.5204-3, Access to and Ownership of Records, all other records in the possession of the Contractor relating to this contract shall be preserved by the Contractor for a period of three years after final payment under this contract or otherwise disposed of in such manner as may be agreed upon by the Government and the Contractor.
                (e) Reports. The Contractor shall furnish such progress reports and schedules, financial and cost reports, and other reports concerning the work under this contract as the Contracting Officer may from time to time require.
                (f) Inspections. The DOE shall have the right to inspect the work and activities of the Contractor under this contract at such time and in such manner as it shall deem appropriate.
                (g) Subcontracts. The Contractor further agrees to require the inclusion of provisions similar to those in paragraphs (a) through (g) and paragraph (h) of this clause in all subcontracts (including fixed-price or unit-price subcontracts or purchase orders) of any tier entered into hereunder where, under the terms of the subcontract, costs incurred are a factor in determining the amount payable to the subcontractor.
                (h) Comptroller general. (1) The Comptroller General of the United States, or an authorized representative, shall have access to and the right to examine any of the contractor's or subcontractor's directly pertinent records involving transactions related to this contract or a subcontract hereunder and to interview any current employee regarding such transactions.
                (2) This paragraph may not be construed to require the Contractor or subcontractor to create or maintain any record that the Contractor or subcontractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to a provision of law.
                (3) Nothing in this contract shall be deemed to preclude an audit by the Government Accountability Office of any transaction under this contract.
                (i) Internal audit. The Contractor agrees to design and maintain an internal audit plan and an internal audit organization.

                (1) Upon contract award, the exercise of any contract option, or the extension of the contract, the Contractor must submit to the Contracting Officer for approval an Internal Audit Implementation Design to include the overall strategy for internal audits. The Audit Implementation Design must describe—
                (i) The internal audit organization's placement within the Contractor's organization and its reporting requirements;
                (ii) The audit organization's size and the experience and educational standards of its staff;
                (iii) The audit organization's relationship to the corporate entities of the Contractor;
                (iv) The standards to be used in conducting the internal audits;
                (v) The overall internal audit strategy of this contract, considering particularly the method of auditing costs incurred in the performance of the contract;
                (vi) The intended use of external audit resources;
                (vii) The plan for audit of subcontracts, both pre-award and post-award; and
                (viii) The schedule for peer review of internal audits by other contractor internal audit organizations, or other independent third party audit entities approved by the DOE Contracting Officer.
                (2) By each January 31 of the contract performance period, the Contractor must submit an annual audit report, providing a summary of the audit activities undertaken during the previous fiscal year. That report shall reflect the results of the internal audits during the previous fiscal year and the actions to be taken to resolve weaknesses identified in the contractor's system of business, financial, or management controls.
                (3) By each June 30 of the contract performance period, the Contractor must submit to the Contracting Officer an annual audit plan for the activities to be undertaken by the internal audit organization during the next fiscal year that is designed to test the costs incurred and contractor management systems described in the internal audit design.
                (4) The Contracting Officer may require revisions to documents submitted under paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), and (i)(3) of this clause, including the design plan for the internal audits, the annual report, and the annual internal audits.
                (j) Remedies. If at any time during contract performance, the Contracting Officer determines that unallowable costs were claimed by the Contractor to the extent of making the contractor's management controls suspect, or the contractor's management systems that validate costs incurred and claimed suspect, the Contracting Officer may, in his or her sole discretion, require the Contractor to cease using the special financial institution account in whole or with regard to specified accounts, requiring reimbursable costs to be claimed by periodic vouchering. In addition, the Contracting Officer, where he or she deems it appropriate, may: Impose a penalty under 48 CFR 970.5242-1, Penalties for Unallowable Costs; require a refund; reduce the contractor's otherwise earned fee; and take such other action as authorized in law, regulation, or this contract.

              Obligation of funds.
              As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(3), insert the following clause:
              
                Obligation of Funds (DEC 2000)
                (a) Obligation of funds. The amount presently obligated by the Government with respect to this contract is __ dollars ($__). Such amount may be increased unilaterally by DOE by written notice to the Contractor and may be increased or decreased by written agreement of the parties (whether or not by formal modification of this contract). Estimated collections from others for work and services to be performed under this contract are not included in the amount presently obligated. Such collections, to the extent actually received by the Contractor, shall be processed and accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements imposed by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as authorizing the Contractor to exceed limitations stated in financial plans established by DOE and furnished to the Contractor from time to time under this contract.
                (b) Limitation on payment by the Government. Except as otherwise provided in this contract and except for costs which may be incurred by the Contractor pursuant to the Termination clause of this contract or costs of claims allowable under the contract occurring after completion or termination and not released by the Contractor at the time of financial settlement of the contract in accordance with the clause entitled “Payments and Advances,” payment by the Government under this contract on account of allowable costs shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount obligated with respect to this contract, less the Contractor's fee and any negotiated fixed amount. Unless expressly negated in this contract, payment on account of those costs excepted in the preceding sentence which are in excess of the amount obligated with respect to this contract shall be subject to the availability of—
                (1) Collections accruing to the Contractor in connection with the work under this contract and processed and accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements imposed by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract; and
                (2) Other funds which DOE may legally use for such purpose, provided DOE will use its best efforts to obtain the appropriation of funds for this purpose if not otherwise available.
                (c) Notices—Contractor excused from further performance. The Contractor shall notify DOE in writing whenever the unexpended balance of available funds (including collections available under paragraph (a) of this clause), plus the Contractor's best estimate of collections to be received and available during the __ day period hereinafter specified, is in the Contractor's best judgment sufficient to continue contract operations at the programmed rate for only __ days and to cover the Contractor's unpaid fee and any negotiated fixed amounts, and outstanding encumbrances and liabilities on account of costs allowable under the contract at the end of such period. Whenever the unexpended balance of available funds (including collections available under paragraph (a) of this clause), less the amount of the Contractor's fee then earned but not paid and any negotiated fixed amounts, is in the Contractor's best judgment sufficient only to liquidate outstanding encumbrances and liabilities on account of costs allowable under this contract, the Contractor shall immediately notify DOE and shall make no further encumbrances or expenditures (except to liquidate existing encumbrances and liabilities), and, unless the parties otherwise agree, the Contractor shall be excused from further performance (except such performance as may become necessary in connection with termination by the Government) and the performance of all work hereunder will be deemed to have been terminated for the convenience of the Government in accordance with the provisions of the Termination clause of this contract.
                (d) Financial plans; cost and encumbrance limitations. In addition to the limitations provided for elsewhere in this contract, DOE may, through financial plans, such as Approved Funding Programs, or other directives issued to the Contractor, establish controls on the costs to be incurred and encumbrances to be made in the performance of the contract work. Such plans and directives may be amended or supplemented from time to time by DOE. The Contractor agrees—
                (1) To comply with the specific limitations (ceilings) on costs and encumbrances set forth in such plans and directives;
                (2) To comply with other requirements of such plans and directives; and
                (3) To notify DOE promptly, in writing, whenever it has reason to believe that any limitation on costs and encumbrances will be exceeded or substantially underrun.
                (e) Government's right to terminate not affected. The giving of any notice under this clause shall not be construed to waive or impair any right of the Government to terminate the contract under the provisions of the Termination clause of this contract.

                Liability With Respect to Cost Accounting Standards (DEC 2000)
                (a) The Contractor is not liable to the Government for increased costs or interest resulting from its failure to comply with the clauses of this contract entitled, “Cost Accounting Standards,” and “Administration of Cost Accounting Standards,” if its failure to comply with the clauses is caused by the Contractor's compliance with published DOE financial management policies and procedures or other requirements established by the Department's Chief Financial Officer or Senior Procurement Executive.

                (b) The Contractor is not liable to the Government for increased costs or interest resulting from its subcontractors' failure to comply with the clauses at 52.230-2, “Cost Accounting Standards,” and 52.230-6, “Administration of Cost Accounting Standards,” if the Contractor includes in each covered subcontract a clause making the subcontractor liable to the Government for increased costs or interest resulting from the subcontractor's failure to comply with the clauses; and the Contractor seeks the subcontract price adjustment and cooperates with the Government in the Government's attempts to recover from the subcontractor.

The Contractor is permitted to provide advance payment utilizing contractor corporate funds for reimbursable work to be performed by the Contractor for a non-Federal entity in instances where advance payment from that entity is required under the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract and such advance cannot be obtained. The Contractor is also permitted to provide advance payment utilizing contractor corporate funds to continue reimbursable work to be performed by the Contractor for a Federal entity when the term or the funds on a Federal interagency agreement required under the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract have elapsed. The Contractor's utilization of contractor corporate funds does not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to comply with all requirements for Strategic Partnership Projects applicable to this contract.

                (b) In the operation of this FFRDC, the Contractor may be provided access beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship, to Government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to Government employees and facilities needed to discharge its responsibilities efficiently and effectively. Because of this special relationship, it is essential that the FFRDC be operated in the public interest with objectivity and independence, be free from organizational conflicts of interest, and have full disclosure of its affairs to the Department of Energy.

                (d) If the Contracting Officer determines that a cost submitted by the Contractor in its submission for settlement of cost incurred is—
                (1) Expressly unallowable, then the Contracting Officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to this contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost. Interest shall be computed from the date of overpayment to the date of repayment using the interest rate specified by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Pub. L. 92-41 (85 Stat. 97); or
                (2) Determined unallowable, then the Contracting Officer shall assess a penalty in an amount equal to two times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to this contract.
                (e) The Contracting Officer may waive the penalty provisions when—

                (1) The Contractor withdraws the submission before the formal initiation of an audit of the submission and submits a revised submission;
                (2) The amount of the unallowable costs allocated to covered contracts is $10,000 or less; or
                (3) The Contractor demonstrates to the Contracting Officer's satisfaction that—
                (i) It has established appropriate policies, personnel training, and an internal control and review system that provides assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from the Contractor's submission for settlement of costs; and
                (ii) The unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the submission.

              Changes.
              As prescribed in 970.4302-1, the contracting officer shall insert the following clause in all management and operating contracts:
              
                Changes (DEC 2000)
                (a) Changes and adjustment of fee. The Contracting Officer may at any time and without notice to the sureties, if any, issue written directions within the general scope of this contract requiring additional work or directing the omission of, or variation in, work covered by this contract. If any such direction results in a material change in the amount or character of the work described in the “Statement of Work,” an equitable adjustment of the fee, if any, shall be made in accordance with the agreement of the parties and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. Any claim by the Contractor for an adjustment under this clause must be asserted in writing within 30 days from the date of receipt by the Contractor of the notification of change; provided, however, that the Contracting Officer, if it is determined that the facts justify such action, may receive and act upon any such claim asserted at any time prior to final payment under this contract. A failure to agree on an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be deemed to be a dispute within the meaning of the clause entitled “Disputes.”
                (b) Work to continue. Nothing contained in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the prosecution of the work in accordance with the requirements of any direction hereunder.
              
              (End of clause)
              [65 FR 81009, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended at 74 FR 36376, 36378, 36380, July 22, 2009]
            
            
              970.5244-1
              Contractor purchasing system.
              As prescribed in 970.4403 insert the following clause:
              
                Contractor Purchasing System (AUG 2016)
                (a) General. The Contractor shall develop, implement, and maintain formal policies, practices, and procedures to be used in the award of subcontracts consistent with this clause and 48 CFR subpart 970.44. The Contractor's purchasing system and methods shall be fully documented, consistently applied, and acceptable to the Department of Energy (DOE) in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4401-1. The Contractor shall maintain file documentation which is appropriate to the value of the purchase and is adequate to establish the propriety of the transaction and the price paid. The Contractor's purchasing performance will be evaluated against such performance criteria and measures as may be set forth elsewhere in this contract. DOE reserves the right at any time to require that the Contractor submit for approval any or all purchases under this contract. The Contractor shall not purchase any item or service, the purchase of which is expressly prohibited by the written direction of DOE, and shall use such special and directed sources as may be expressly required by the DOE Contracting Officer. DOE will conduct periodic appraisals of the Contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function, including the Contractor's compliance with its approved system and methods. Such appraisals will be performed through the conduct of Contractor Purchasing System Reviews in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 44.3, or, when approved by the Contracting Officer, through the Contractor's participation in the conduct of the Balanced Scorecard performance measurement and performance management system. The Contractor's approved purchasing system and methods shall include the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (y) of this clause.
                (b) Acquisition of utility services. Utility services shall be acquired in accordance with the requirements of 48 CFR subpart 970.41.
                (c) Acquisition of real property. Real property shall be acquired in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 917.74.
                (d) Advance notice of proposed subcontract awards. Advance notice shall be provided in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4401-3.
                (e) Audit of subcontractors. (1) The Contractor shall provide for—
                (i) Periodic post-award audit of cost-reimbursement subcontractors at all tiers; and
                (ii) Audits, where necessary, to provide a valid basis for pre-award or cost or price analysis.

                (2) Responsibility for determining the costs allowable under each cost-reimbursement subcontract remains with the contractor or next higher-tier subcontractor. The Contractor shall provide, in appropriate cases, for the timely involvement of the Contractor and the DOE Contracting Officer in resolution of subcontract cost allowability.
                (3) Where audits of subcontractors at any tier are required, arrangements may be made to have the cognizant Federal agency perform the audit of the subcontract. These arrangements shall be made administratively between DOE and the other agency involved and shall provide for the cognizant agency to audit in an appropriate manner in light of the magnitude and nature of the subcontract. In no case, however, shall these arrangements preclude determination by the DOE Contracting Officer of the allowability or unallowability of subcontractor costs claimed for reimbursement by the Contractor.
                (4) Allowable costs for cost reimbursable subcontracts are to be determined in accordance with the cost principles of 48 CFR Part 31, appropriate for the type of organization to which the subcontract is to be awarded, as supplemented by 48 CFR part 931. Allowable costs in the purchase or transfer from contractor-affiliated sources shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4402-3 and 48 CFR 31.205-26(e).
                (f) Bonds and insurance. (1) The Contractor shall require performance bonds in penal amounts as set forth in 48 CFR 28.102-2(a) for all fixed-priced and unit-priced construction subcontracts in excess of $150,000. The Contractor shall consider the use of performance bonds in fixed-price non-construction subcontracts, where appropriate.
                (2) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost reimbursement construction subcontracts in excess of $150,000, a payment bond shall be obtained on Standard Form 25A modified to name the Contractor as well as the United States of America as obligees. The penal amounts shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 28.102-2(b).
                (3) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost-reimbursement construction subcontracts greater than $25,000, but not greater than $100,000, the Contractor shall select two or more of the payment protections at 48 CFR 28.102-1(b), giving particular consideration to the inclusion of an irrevocable letter of credit as one of the selected alternatives.
                (4) A subcontractor may have more than one acceptable surety in both construction and other subcontracts, provided that in no case will the liability of any one surety exceed the maximum penal sum for which it is qualified for any one obligation. For subcontracts other than construction, a co-surety (two or more sureties together) may reinsure amounts in excess of their individual capacity, with each surety having the required underwriting capacity that appears on the list of acceptable corporate sureties.
                (g) Buy American. The Contractor shall comply with the provisions of the Buy American Act as reflected in 48 CFR 52.225-1 and 48 CFR 52.225-9. The Contractor shall forward determinations of non-availability of individual items to the DOE Contracting Officer for approval. Items in excess of $500,000 require the prior concurrence of the Head of Contracting Activity. If, however, the Contractor has an approved purchasing system, the Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize the Contractor to make determinations of non-availability for individual items valued at $500,000 or less.
                (h) Construction and architect-engineer subcontracts. (1) Independent Estimates. A detailed, independent estimate of costs shall be prepared for all construction work to be subcontracted.
                (2) Specifications. Specifications for construction shall be prepared in accordance with the DOE publication entitled “General Design Criteria Manual.”
                (3) Prevention of conflict of interest. (i) The Contractor shall not award a subcontract for construction to the architect-engineer firm or an affiliate that prepared the design. This prohibition does not preclude the award of a “turnkey” subcontract so long as the subcontractor assumes all liability for defects in design and construction and consequential damages.
                (ii) The Contractor shall not award both a cost-reimbursement subcontract and a fixed-price subcontract for construction or architect-engineer services or any combination thereof to the same firm where those subcontracts will be performed at the same site.
                (iii) The Contractor shall not employ the construction subcontractor or an affiliate to inspect the firm's work. The contractor shall assure that the working relationships of the construction subcontractor and the subcontractor inspecting its work and the authority of the inspector are clearly defined.
                (i) Contractor-affiliated sources. Equipment, materials, supplies, or services from a contractor-affiliated source shall be purchased or transferred in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4402-3.
                (j) Contractor-subcontractor relationship. The obligations of the Contractor under paragraph (a) of this clause, including the development of the purchasing system and methods, and purchases made pursuant thereto, shall not relieve the Contractor of any obligation under this contract (including, among other things, the obligation to properly supervise, administer, and coordinate the work of subcontractors). Subcontracts shall be in the name of the Contractor, and shall not bind or purport to bind the Government.
                (k) Government Property. The Contractor shall establish and maintain a property management system that complies with criteria in 48 CFR 970.5245-1, Property, and 48 CFR 52.245-1, Government Property.
                
                (l) Indemnification. Except for Price-Anderson Nuclear Hazards Indemnity, no subcontractor may be indemnified except with the prior approval of the Senior Procurement Executive.
                (m) Leasing of motor vehicles. Contractors shall comply with 48 CFR subpart 8.11 and 48 CFR subpart 908.11.
                (n) [Reserved]
                (o) Management, acquisition and use of information resources. Requirements for automatic data processing resources and telecommunications facilities, services, and equipment, shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable DOE Orders and regulations regarding information resources.
                (p) Priorities, allocations and allotments. Priorities, allocations and allotments shall be extended to appropriate subcontracts in accordance with the clause or clauses of this contract dealing with priorities and allocations.
                (q) Purchase of special items. Purchase of the following items shall be in accordance with the following provisions of 48 CFR subpart 8.5, 48 CFR subpart 908.71, Federal Management Regulation 41 CFR part 102, and the Federal Property Management Regulation 41 CFR chapter 101:

                (r) Purchase versus lease determinations. Contractors shall determine whether required equipment and property should be purchased or leased, and establish appropriate thresholds for application of lease versus purchase determinations. Such determinations shall be made—
                (1) At time of original acquisition;
                (2) When lease renewals are being considered; and
                (3) At other times as circumstances warrant.

                (v) Termination. When subcontracts are terminated as a result of the termination of all or a portion of this contract, the Contractor shall settle with subcontractors in conformity with the policies and principles relating to settlement of prime contracts in 48 CFR subparts 49.1, 49.2 and 49.3.

              970.5245-1
              Property.
              As prescribed in 970.4501-1(a), insert the following clause:
              
                Property (AUG 2016)
                (a) Furnishing of Government property. The Government reserves the right to furnish any property or services required for the performance of the work under this contract.
                (b) Title to property. Except as otherwise provided by the Contracting Officer, title to all materials, equipment, supplies, and tangible personal property of every kind and description purchased by the Contractor, for the cost of which the Contractor is entitled to be reimbursed as a direct item of cost under this contract, shall pass directly from the vendor to the Government. The Government reserves the right to inspect, and to accept or reject, any item of such property. The Contractor shall make such disposition of rejected items as the Contracting Officer shall direct. Title to other property, the cost of which is reimbursable to the Contractor under this contract, shall pass to and vest in the Government upon (1) issuance for use of such property in the performance of this contract, or (2) commencement of processing or use of such property in the performance of this contract, or (3) reimbursement of the cost thereof by the Government, whichever first occurs. Property furnished by the Government and property purchased or furnished by the Contractor, title to which vests in the Government, under this paragraph are hereinafter referred to as Government property. Title to Government property shall not be affected by the incorporation of the property into or the attachment of it to any property not owned by the Government, nor shall such Government property or any part thereof, be or become a fixture or lose its identity as personality by reason of affixation to any realty.
                (c) Identification. To the extent directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall identify Government property coming into the Contractor's possession or custody, by marking and segregating in such a way, satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, as shall indicate its ownership by the Government.
                (d) Disposition. The Contractor shall make such disposition of Government property which has come into the possession or custody of the Contractor under this contract as the Contracting Officer may direct during the progress of the work or upon completion or termination of this contract. The Contractor may, upon such terms and conditions as the Contracting Officer may approve, sell, or exchange such property, or acquire such property at a price agreed upon by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor as the fair value thereof. The amount received by the Contractor as the result of any disposition, or the agreed fair value of any such property acquired by the Contractor, shall be applied in reduction of costs allowable under this contract or shall be otherwise credited to account to the Government, as the Contracting Officer may direct. Upon completion of the work or the termination of this contract, the Contractor shall render an accounting, as prescribed by the Contracting Officer, of all government property which had come into the possession or custody of the Contractor under this contract.
                (e) Protection of government property—management of high-risk property and classified materials. (1) The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions, and such other actions as may be directed by the Contracting Officer, or in the absence of such direction, in accordance with sound business practice, to safeguard and protect government property in the Contractor's possession or custody.
                (2) In addition, the Contractor shall ensure that adequate safeguards are in place, and adhered to, for the handling, control and disposition of high-risk property and classified materials throughout the life cycle of the property and materials consistent with the policies, practices and procedures for property management contained in the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 CFR chapter 101), the Department of Energy (DOE) Property Management Regulations (41 CFR chapter 109), and other applicable Regulations.
                (3) High-risk property is property, the loss, destruction, damage to, or the unintended or premature transfer of which could pose risks to the public, the environment, or the national security interests of the United States. High-risk property includes proliferation sensitive, nuclear related dual use, export controlled, chemically or radioactively contaminated, hazardous, and specially designed and prepared property, including property on the militarily critical technologies list.
                (f) Risk of loss of Government property. (1)(i) The Contractor shall not be liable for the loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property unless such loss, destruction, or damage was caused by any of the following—
                (A) Willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel;
                (B) Failure of the Contractor's managerial personnel to take all reasonable steps to comply with any appropriate written direction of the Contracting Officer to safeguard such property under paragraph (e) of this clause; or
                (C) Failure of contractor managerial personnel to establish, administer, or properly maintain an approved property management system in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this clause.
                (ii) If, after an initial review of the facts, the Contracting Officer informs the Contractor that there is reason to believe that the loss, destruction of, or damage to the government property results from conduct falling within one of the categories set forth above, the burden of proof shall be upon the Contractor to show that the Contractor should not be required to compensate the government for the loss, destruction, or damage.

                (2) In the event that the Contractor is determined liable for the loss, destruction or damage to Government property in accordance with (f)(1) of this clause, the Contractor's compensation to the Government shall be determined as follows:
                (i) For damaged property, the compensation shall be the cost of repairing such damaged property, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement of the damaged property. However, the value of repair costs shall not exceed the fair market value of the damaged property. If a fair market value of the property does not exist, the Contracting Officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts and circumstances.
                (ii) For destroyed or lost property, the compensation shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such loss or destruction, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement and costs associated with the disposition of destroyed property. If a fair market value of the property does not exist, the Contracting Officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts and circumstances.
                (3) The portion of the cost of insurance obtained by the Contractor that is allocable to coverage of risks of loss referred to in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause is not allowable.
                (g) Steps to be taken in event of loss. In the event of any damage, destruction, or loss to Government property in the possession or custody of the Contractor with a value above the threshold set out in the Contractor's approved property management system, the Contractor —
                (1) Shall immediately inform the Contracting Officer of the occasion and extent thereof,
                (2) Shall take all reasonable steps to protect the property remaining, and
                (3) Shall repair or replace the damaged, destroyed, or lost property in accordance with the written direction of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall take no action prejudicial to the right of the Government to recover therefore, and shall furnish to the Government, on request, all reasonable assistance in obtaining recovery.
                (h) Government property for Government use only. Government property shall be used only for the performance of this contract.
                (i) Property Management—(1) Property Management System. (i) The Contractor shall establish, administer, and properly maintain an approved property management system of accounting for and control, utilization, maintenance, repair, protection, preservation, and disposition of Government property in its possession under the contract. The Contractor's property management system shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval and shall be maintained and administered in accordance with sound business practice, applicable Federal Property Management Regulations and Department of Energy Property Management Regulations, and such directives or instructions which the Contracting Officer may from time to time prescribe.
                (ii) In order for a property management system to be approved, it must provide for—
                (A) Comprehensive coverage of property from the requirement identification, through its life cycle, to final disposition;
                (B) [Reserved]
                (C) Full integration with the Contractor's other administrative and financial systems; and
                (D) A method for continuously improving property management practices through the identification of best practices established by “best in class” performers.
                (iii) Approval of the Contractor's property management system shall be contingent upon the completion of the baseline inventory as provided in subparagraph (i)(2) of this clause.
                (2) Property Inventory. (i) Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall within six months after execution of the contract provide a baseline inventory covering all items of Government property.
                (ii) If the Contractor is succeeding another contractor in the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall conduct a joint reconciliation of the property inventory with the predecessor contractor. The Contractor agrees to participate in a joint reconciliation of the property inventory at the completion of this contract. This information will be used to provide a baseline for the succeeding contract as well as information for closeout of the predecessor contract.
                (j) The term “contractor's managerial personnel” as used in this clause means the Contractor's directors, officers and any of its managers, superintendents, or other equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of—
                (1) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business; or
                (2) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operations at any one facility or separate location to which this contract is being performed; or
                (3) A separate and complete major industrial operation in connection with the performance of this contract; or
                (4) A separate and complete major construction, alteration, or repair operation in connection with performance of this contract; or
                (5) A separate and discrete major task or operation in connection with the performance of this contract.

              1001.101
              Purpose.
              This subpart establishes Chapter 10, the Department of the Treasury Acquisition Regulation (DTAR), within Title 48 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) System. The DTAR contains policies and procedures that supplement FAR coverage and directly affect the contractual relationship between the Department of the Treasury and its business partners (e.g., prospective offerors/bidders and contractors). When FAR coverage is adequate, there will be no corresponding DTAR coverage.
            
            
              1001.104
              Applicability.
              The DTAR applies to all acquisitions of supplies and services, which obligate appropriated funds. For acquisitions made from non-appropriated funds, the Senior Procurement Executive will determine the rules and procedures that will apply. The DTAR does not apply to the acquisitions of the U.S. Mint.

              1001.105-1
              Publication and code arrangement.

              The DTAR and its subsequent changes will be published in the Federal Register and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The DTAR will be issued as 48 CFR Chapter 10.

              Arrangement of regulations.
              (a) References and citations. The DTAR is divided into the same parts, subparts, sections, subsections, and paragraphs as the FAR except that 10 or 100 will precede the DTAR citation so that there are four numbers to the left of the first decimal. Reference to DTAR material must be made in a manner similar to that prescribed by FAR 1.105-2(c).
            
            
              1001.105-3

              1001.106
              OMB Approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

              OMB has assigned the following control numbers that must appear on the upper right corner of the face page of each solicitation, contract, modification, and order: OMB Control No. 1505-0081 (Offeror submissions), OMB Control No. 1505-0080 (Contractor submissions), OMB Control No. 1505-0107 (Protests). OMB regulations and OMB's approval and assignment of control numbers are conditioned upon Treasury bureaus not requiring more than three copies (including the original) of any document of information. OMB has granted a waiver to permit the Department to require up to eight copies of proposal packages, including proprietary data, for solicitations, provided that contractors who submit only an original and two copies will not be placed at a disadvantage.

              Policy.
              (a)(1) The DTAR (48 CFR Chapter 10) is issued for Treasury implementation in accordance with the authority cited in FAR 1.301(b). The DTAR supplements the Federal Acquisition Regulation by establishing uniform policies for all acquisition activities throughout the Department of the Treasury, except for the United States Mint.

              (a) There are various Federal laws and regulations that in aggregate prohibit the Federal Government from entering into a contract with an entity where the awarding agency is aware of an unpaid Federal tax liability (see FAR subpart 9.1) unless the agency has considered suspension or debarment and has made a determination that this further action is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government.
              (b) IRS contracting officers shall include a provision in all solicitations regardless of dollar value, which contains a consent to disclosure to be signed and dated by a person authorized to act on behalf of the offeror as defined in 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1(e)(4). The consent to disclosure will authorize officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury, including the IRS, to disclose the results of the tax check to the authorized representative(s) of the offeror. In the absence of a signed and dated consent to disclosure in an offer, taxpayer return information of the offeror may not be disclosed, which subsequently may remove the offeror from eligibility to receive an award.
            
            
              1009.7004
              Procedure.
              IRS contracting officers shall not proceed with award, at any dollar value, until a tax check has been performed on the apparent successful offeror. See IRS Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 9.1.
              (a) The contracting officer, regardless of an offeror's response in paragraph (a)(1) of the provision 52.209-5, Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters, paragraph (b)(1) of the provision at FAR 52.209-11, or paragraphs (h) and (q)(2)(i) of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 9.104-5(b)), shall request a tax check through the IRS designated point of contact. The request shall include only the information required for purposes of conducting the tax check.
              (b) If the result of the tax check demonstrates the offeror as having a delinquent Federal tax liability, the contracting officer shall—
              (1) Confirm the offer includes a signed and dated consent to disclosure (see 1052.209-70, Notice and Consent to Disclose and Use of Taxpayer Return Information), the absence of which may remove the offeror from eligibility to receive an award under the solicitation because taxpayer return information of the offeror may not be disclosed.
              (2) If the consent to disclosure is completed in the offer, notify the authorized representative(s) of the offeror that a delinquent Federal tax liability exists and therefore the offeror is ineligible for award.
              (i) If upon notification the offeror provides the contracting officer with documentation, within the timeframe specified by the contracting officer, that demonstrates the offeror's tax status as being paid-in-full or that an approved payment agreement is in place, the contracting officer will coordinate with the appropriate office within IRS to validate the tax status. If the offeror is found to be tax compliant, the contracting officer will notify the offeror of such. Assuming the offeror meets all other standards of responsibility, the offeror is eligible for award.
              (3) Notify, in accordance with IRS PGI 9.1, the Department of the Treasury official responsible for suspension and debarment for purposes of requesting a determination in accordance with FAR 9.104-5(a)(2) and FAR 9.104-5(b)(3) respectively before an award to that contractor can be made.
              (c) If the result of the tax check demonstrates the offeror as tax compliant then the offeror is eligible for award, assuming all other standards of responsibility have been met.
              (d) The contracting officer shall include in the contract file documentation that verifies the tax check was conducted and if the results confirm a delinquent Federal tax liability existed at the time of award, confirmation that the offeror was notified of such.
            
            
              1009.7005
              Solicitation provision.
              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision 1052.209-70, Notice and Consent to Disclose and Use of Taxpayer Return Information, in all IRS solicitations regardless of dollar value, including solicitations for acquisition of commercial items (including Commercially Available Off-The-Shelf items).

              The Treasury Mentor Protégé Program.
              (a)-(b) [Reserved]
              (c) Non-affiliation. For purposes of the Small Business Act, a protégé firm may not be considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely on the basis that the protégé firm is receiving developmental assistance referred to in paragraph (m) of this section, from such mentor firm under the Mentor-Protégé Program.
              (d) General policy. (1) Eligible contractors, not included on the “System for Award Management Exclusions” that are approved as mentors will enter into agreements with eligible protégés. Mentors provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of protégés to perform as contractors or subcontractors.
              (2) A firm's status as a protégé under a Treasury contract shall not have an effect on the firm's eligibility to seek other contracts or subcontracts.
              (e) Incentives for contractor participation. (1) Under the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(E), Treasury is authorized to provide appropriate incentives in negotiated contractual actions to encourage subcontracting opportunities consistent with the efficient and economical performance of the contract. Proposed mentor-protégé efforts will be considered during the evaluation of such negotiated, competitive offers. Contracting Officers may provide, as an incentive, a bonus score, not to exceed 5% of the relative importance assigned to the non-price factors. If this incentive is used, the Contracting Officer shall include language in the solicitation indicating that this adjustment may occur.
              (2) Before awarding a contract that requires a subcontracting plan, the existence of a mentor-protégé arrangement, and performance (if any) under such an existing arrangement, will be considered by the Contracting Officer in:
              (i) Evaluating the quality of a proposed subcontracting plan under FAR 19.705-4; and,
              (ii) Evaluating the contractor compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted in previous contracts as a factor in determining contractor responsibility under FAR 19.705-5(a)(1).
              (3) The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) Mentoring Award is a non-monetary award that will be presented (annually on a fiscal year basis or as often as is appropriate) to the mentoring firm providing the most effective developmental support of a protégé. The Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will recommend an award winner to the Director, OSDBU.
              (f) [Reserved]
              (g) Mentor firms. A mentor firm may be either a large or small business, eligible for award of a Government contract that can provide developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of protégés to perform as subcontractors. Mentors will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with protégés in addition to firms with whom they have established business relationships.
              (h) Protégé firms. (1) For selection as a protégé, a firm must be:
              (i) A small business, women-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, small business owned and controlled by veteran or service disabled veteran, or qualified HUBZone small business, or a qualified 8(a) concern;
              (ii) Qualified as a small business under the NAICS code for the services or supplies to be provided by the protégé under its subcontract to the mentor; and
              (iii) Eligible for award of Government contracts.
              (2) Except small disadvantaged businesses and qualified HUBZone small business firms, a protégé firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential protégés that they meet the specified eligibility requirements. The h(1)(i), small disadvantaged business, or qualified HUBZone small business status eligibility and documentation requirements are determined according to FAR 19.304 and 19.1303, respectively.
              (3) Protégés may not have multiple mentors unless approved, in writing, by the Director, OSDBU. Protégés participating in other agency mentor protégé programs in addition to the Treasury Mentor-Protégé Program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of mentoring activity for each agency's program.
              (i) Selection of protégé firms. (1) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting protégé firms. The mentor is encouraged to identify and select the types of protégé firms listed in 1019.202-70(h). Mentor firms may have multiple protégés.
              (2) The selection of protégé firms by mentor firms may not be protested. Any question regarding the size or eligibility status of an entity selected by a mentor to be a protégé must be referred solely to Treasury's OSDBU for resolution. Treasury, at its discretion, may seek an advisory opinion from the Small Business Administration (SBA).
              (j) Application process for mentor firms to participate in the program. (1) Firms interested in becoming a mentor firm may apply in writing to Treasury's OSDBU. The application will be evaluated based upon the description of the nature and extent of technical and managerial support proposed as well as the extent of other developmental assistance in the form of equity investment, loans, joint-venture support and traditional subcontracting support.
              (k) OSDBU review and approval process of agreement. (1) OSDBU will review the information specified in 1019.202-70(l). The OSDBU review will be completed no later than 30 calendar days after receipt.
              (2) Upon completion of the review, the mentor may implement the developmental assistance program.
              (3) An approved agreement will be incorporated into the mentor firm's contract(s) with Treasury.
              (4) If OSDBU disapproves the agreement, the mentor may provide additional information for reconsideration. Upon finding deficiencies that OSDBU considers correctable, OSDBU will notify the mentor and provide a list of defects. Any additional information or corrections requested will be provided within 30 calendar days. The review of any supplemental material will be completed within 30 calendar days after receipt by OSDBU. When submission of additional data is required during a proposal evaluation for a new contract award, shorter timeframes for submission, review and re-evaluation for approval may be authorized by OSDBU.
              (5) The agreement defines the relationship between the mentor and protégé firms only. The agreement itself does not create any privity of contract between the mentor or protégé and Treasury.
              (l) Agreement contents. The contents of the agreement will contain:
              (1) Names and addresses of mentor and protégé firms and a point of contact within both firms who will oversee the agreement;

              (2) Procedures for the mentor firm to notify the protégé firm, OSDBU and the Contracting Officer, in writing, at least 30 days in advance of the mentor firm's intent to voluntarily withdraw from the Mentor-Protégé Program;
              (3) Procedures for a protégé firm to notify the mentor firm in writing at least 30 days in advance of the protégé firm's intent to voluntarily terminate the mentor-protégé agreement. The mentor must notify OSDBU and the Contracting Officer immediately upon receipt of such notice from the protégé;
              (4) Each proposed mentor-protégé relationship must include information on the mentor's ability to provide developmental assistance to the protégé and how that assistance will potentially increase contracting and subcontracting opportunities for the protégé firm;
              (5) A description of the type of developmental program that will be provided by the mentor firm to the protégé firm, to include a description of the potential subcontract work, and a schedule for providing assistance and criteria for evaluation of the protégés developmental success;
              (6) A listing of the types and dollar amounts of subcontracts that may be awarded to the protégé firm;
              (7) Program participation term;
              (8) Termination procedures;
              (9) Plan for accomplishing work should the agreement be terminated; and
              (10) Other terms and conditions, as appropriate.
              (m) Developmental assistance. The forms of developmental assistance a mentor can provide to a protégé include:
              (1) Management guidance relating to financial management, organizational management, overall business management/planning, business development, and technical assistance.
              (2) Loans;
              (3) Rent-free use of facilities and/or equipment;
              (4) Property;
              (5) Temporary assignment of personnel to protégé for purpose of training; and
              (6) Any other types of mutually beneficial assistance.
              (n) Obligation. (1) Mentor or protégé firms may voluntarily withdraw from the Mentor-Protégé Program. However, such withdrawal shall not excuse the contractor from compliance with contract requirements.
              (2) At the conclusion of each year in the Mentor-Protégé Program, the contractor and protégé must formally brief the Department of the Treasury team regarding program accomplishments as they pertain to the approved agreement. Individual briefings may be conducted, at the request of either party. Treasury will consider the following:
              (i) Specific actions taken by the mentor, during the evaluation period, to increase the participation of protégés as suppliers to the Federal government and to commercial entities;
              (ii) Specific actions taken by the mentor, during the evaluation period, to develop the technical and corporate administrative expertise of a protégé as defined in the agreement;
              (iii) To what extent the protégé has met the developmental objectives in the agreement; and
              (iv) To what extent the mentor firm's participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program resulted in the protégé receiving contract(s) and subcontract(s) from private firms and agencies other than the Department of the Treasury.
              (v) Mentor and protégé firms must submit an evaluation to OSDBU at the conclusion of the mutually agreed upon program period, the conclusion of the contract, or the voluntary withdrawal by either party from the Mentor-Protégé Program, whichever comes first.
              (vi) Protégé firms shall submit a post completion report 24 months after exiting the Mentor-Protégé Program. The post completion report will assist the Department of the Treasury in assessing the progress of Protégé firms upon completion of the program.
              (o) [Reserved]

              1032.770-1
              Scope of section.
              This section provides policy and procedure for using incremental funding for fixed-price, time-and-material and labor-hour contracts during a period in which funds are provided to Treasury Departmental Offices or Bureaus, under a continuing resolution (CR). HCAs may develop necessary supplemental internal procedures as well as guidance to advise potential offerors, offerors and contractors of these policies and procedures. Additionally, Bureaus who receive non-appropriated funds may utilize and tailor these policies and procedures to fit their needs.
            
            
              1032.770-2
              Definition.
              “Continuing Resolution” means an appropriation, in the form of a joint resolution, that provides budget authority for federal agencies, specific activities, or both to continue operation until the regular appropriations are enacted. Typically, a continuing resolution is used when legislative action on appropriations is not completed by the beginning of a fiscal year.
            
            
              1032.770-3
              General.

              The Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341 and FAR 32.702, states that no officer or employee of the Government may create or authorize an obligation in excess of the funds available, or in advance of appropriations unless otherwise authorized by law. A CR provides funding for continuing projects or activities that were conducted in the prior fiscal year for which appropriations, funds, or other authority was previously made available. Each CR is governed by the specific terms in that specific CR (e.g. duration of the CR) and under certain CRs, the funding amounts available for award of contract actions are inadequate to fund the entire amounts needed for some contract actions.
            
            
              1032.770-4
              Policy.
              (a) A fixed-price, time-and-materials or labor-hour contract or order for commercial or non-commercial supplies or severable or non-severable services may be incrementally funded when—
              (1) Funds are provided to a Treasury Departmental Office or Bureau under a CR. This includes funds appropriated to a bureau, funds appropriated to another entity that will be directly obligated on a Treasury contract, and funds in a revolving fund or similar account that will be reimbursed by a customer agency funded by a CR;
              (2) Sufficient funds are not being allocated from the responsible fiscal authority to fully fund the contract action that is otherwise authorized to be issued;
              (3) There is no statutory restriction that would preclude the proposed use of funds;
              (4) Funds are available and unexpired, as of the date the funds are obligated;
              (5) Assurance is provided by the responsible financial authority that full funding is anticipated once an Appropriation Act is enacted; and
              (6) The clause prescribed by 1032.770-7 is incorporated into the contract or order.
              (b) Incremental funding may be limited to individual line item(s) or a particular order(s).
            
            
              1032.770-5
              Limitations.
              (a) This policy does not apply to contract actions that are not covered by the CR.
              (b) If this policy is applied to non-severable services or to supplies, the contracting officer shall take into consideration the business risk to the Government if funding does not become available to fully fund the contract. If the contracting officer determines the use of incremental funding for non-severable services or supplies is in the best interest of the Government the contracting officer shall ensure the contractor fully understands how the limitations of the Government's liabilities under the contract might impact its ability to perform within the prescribed contract schedule.
            
            
              
              1032.770-6
              Procedures.
              (a) An incrementally funded fixed-price, time-and-materials or labor-hour contract shall be fully funded once funds are available.
              (b) The contracting officer shall ensure that sufficient funds are allotted to the contract to cover the total amount payable to the contractor in the event of termination of convenience by the Government.
              (c) Upon receipt of the contractor's notice under paragraph (c) of the clause at 1052.232-90, Limitation of Government's Obligation, the contracting officer shall promptly provide written notice to the contractor that the Government is—
              (i) Obligating additional funds for continued performance and increasing the Government's limitation of obligation in a specified amount;
              (ii) Obligating the full amount of funds needed;
              (iii) Terminating for convenience, as applicable, the affected line items or contract; or
              (iv) Considering whether to allot additional funds; and
              (A) The contractor is entitled by the contract terms to stop work when the Government's limitation of obligation is reached; and
              (B) Any costs expended beyond the Government's limitation of obligation are at the contractor's risk.
              (d) Upon learning that the contract will receive no further funds by the date provided in the notice under paragraph (c) of the clause at 1052.232-70, Limitation of Government's Obligation, the contracting officer shall promptly give the contractor written notice of the Government's decision and terminate the affected line items or contract, as applicable, for the convenience of the Government.
            
            
              1032.770-7
              Clause.
              The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1052.232-70, Limitation of Government's Obligation, in
              (a) Solicitations and resultant contracts when incremental funding of fixed-price, time-and-material or labor-hour contract via a CR is anticipated; or
              (b) Contracts or orders when incremental funding of a fixed-price, time-and-material or labor-hour contract is authorized and the Treasury Departmental Office or Bureau is operating under a CR (see 1032.770-4); and
              (c) The CO shall insert the information required in paragraphs (a) and (c) of the clause.

              This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for electronic submission and processing of payment requests.
            
            
              1032.7001
              Definitions.
              “Payment request,” as used in this subpart, is defined in the clause at 1052.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.
            
            
              1032.7002
              Policy.
              (a) Contracts shall require the electronic submission of payment requests, except for—
              (1) Purchases paid for with a Government-wide commercial purchase card;
              (2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise classified information or national security;
              (b) Where a contract otherwise requires the electronic submission of invoices, the Contracting Officer may authorize alternate procedures only if the Contracting Officer makes a written determination that:
              (1) The Department of the Treasury is unable to receive electronic payment requests or provide acceptance electronically;
              (2) The contractor has demonstrated that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome; or

              (3) The contractor is in the process of transitioning to electronic submission of payment requests, but needs additional time to complete such transition. Authorizations granted on this basis must specify a date by which the contractor will transition to electronic submission.
              
              (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, Treasury officials shall process electronic payment submissions through the Treasury Invoice Processing Platform or successor system.
              (d) If the requirement for electronic submission of payment requests is waived under paragraph (a)(2) or paragraph (b) of this section, the contract or alternate payment authorization, as applicable, shall specify the form and method of payment request submission.

              As used in this part—
              
                Development, Modernization, Enhancement (DME) is the portion of an IT investment/project which deals with developing and implementing new or enhanced technology in support of an agency's mission.
              
                Major acquisitions for development are defined as contracts, awarded in support of one or more Major IT investments with DME activities, which meet the contract threshold for fully applying FAR 34.2 procedures.
              
                Performance-based acquisition management means a documented, systematic process for program management, which includes integration of program scope, schedule and cost objectives, establishment of a baseline plan for accomplishment of program objectives, and use of earned value techniques for performance measurement during execution of the program. A performance-based acquisition (as defined in FAR 37.101) or an acquisition with a defined quality assurance plan that includes performance standards/measures should be the basis for monitoring the contractor.

              (2) What work is being performed in-house (by government personnel) versus contracted out for the investment;
              (3) A description of the effort, by acquisition, and the plans to include required clauses in the acquisitions;
              (4) A timetable of major acquisition award and administration activities, including plans for contract transitions;
              (5) An investment/system surveillance plan;

              1052.209-70
              Notice and Consent to Disclose and Use of Taxpayer Return Information.
              As prescribed in 1009.7005, insert the following provision:
              
                Notice and Consent To Disclose and Use of Taxpayer Return Information (NOV 2017)
                (a) Definitions. As used in this provision—
                
                  Authorized representative(s) of the offeror means the person(s) identified to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) within the consent to disclose by the offeror as authorized to represent the offeror in disclosure matters pertaining to the offer.
                
                  Delinquent Federal tax liability means any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability.
                
                  Tax check means an IRS process that accesses and uses taxpayer return information to support the Government's determination of an offeror's eligibility to receive an award, including but not limited to implementation of the statutory prohibition of making an award to corporations that have an unpaid Federal tax liability (see FAR 9.104-5(b)).
                (b) Notice. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(a) taxpayer return information, with few exceptions, is confidential. Under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6103(h)(1), officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury, including the IRS, may have access to taxpayer return information as necessary for purposes of tax administration. The Department of the Treasury has determined that an IRS contractor's compliance with the tax laws is a tax administration matter and that the access to and use of taxpayer return information is needed for determining an offeror's eligibility to receive an award, including but not limited to implementation of the statutory prohibition of making an award to corporations that have an unpaid Federal tax liability (see FAR 9.104-5).
                (1) The performance of a tax check is one means that will be used for determining an offeror's eligibility to receive an award in response to this solicitation (see FAR 9.104). As a result, the offeror may want to take steps to confirm it does not have a delinquent Federal tax liability prior to submission of its response to this solicitation. If the offeror recently settled a delinquent Federal tax liability, the offeror may want to take steps to obtain information in order to demonstrate the offeror's responsibility to the contracting officer (see FAR 9.104-5).
                (c) The offeror shall execute the consent to disclosure provided in paragraph (d) of this provision and include it with the submission of its offer. The consent to disclosure shall be signed by an authorized person as required and defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(c) and 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1(e)(4).
                (d) Consent to disclosure. I hereby consent to the disclosure of taxpayer return information (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(b)(2)) as follows:

                The Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, may disclose the results of the tax check conducted in connection with the offeror's response to this solicitation, including taxpayer return information as necessary to resolve any matters pertaining to the results of the tax check, to the authorized representatives of [insert OFFEROR NAME] on this offer.

                I am aware that in the absence of this authorization, the taxpayer return information of [insert OFFEROR NAME] is confidential and may not be disclosed, which subsequently may remove the offer from eligibility to receive an award under this solicitation.
                
                I consent to disclosure of taxpayer return information to the following person(s):

                I am aware that in the absence of this authorization, the taxpayer return information of [insert OFFEROR NAME] is confidential and may not be disclosed, which subsequently may remove the offer from eligibility to receive an award under this solicitation.
                
                I consent to disclosure of taxpayer return information to the following person(s):
                [insert PERSON(S) NAME AND CONTACT INFORMATION]:
                
                
                
                
                

                I certify that I have the authority to execute this consent on behalf of [insert OFFEROR NAME].
                
                Offeror Name:

                Contractor Publicity (APR 2015)

                The Contractor, or any entity or representative acting on behalf of the Contractor, shall not refer to the supplies or services furnished pursuant to the provisions of this contract in any news release or commercial advertising, or in connection with any news release or commercial advertising, without first obtaining explicit written consent to do so from the Contracting Officer. Should any reference to such supplies or services appear in any news release or commercial advertising issued by or on behalf of the Contractor without the required consent, the Government shall consider institution of all remedies available under applicable law, including 31 U.S.C. 333, and this contract. Further, any violation of this clause may be considered as part of the evaluation of past performance.

                8(a) Business Development Program Awards (JUN 2003)
                (a) This purchase/delivery/task order or contract is issued by the contracting activity directly to the 8(a) program participant/contractor pursuant to the Partnership Agreement between the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of the Treasury. However, the Small Business Administration is the prime contractor and retains responsibility for 8(a) certification, 8(a) eligibility determinations and related issues, and provides counseling and assistance to the 8(a) contractor under the 8(a) Business Development program. The cognizant SBA district office is:
                [To be completed by the contracting officer at the time of award]
                (b) The contracting officer is responsible for administering the purchase/delivery/task order or contract and taking any action on behalf of the Government under the terms and conditions of the purchase/delivery/task order or contract, to include providing the cognizant SBA district office with a signed copy of the purchase/delivery/task order or contract award within 15 days of the award. However, the contracting officer shall give advance notice to the SBA before it issues a final notice terminating performance, either in whole or in part, under the purchase order or contract. The contracting officer shall also coordinate with SBA prior to processing any novation agreement. The contracting officer may assign contract administration functions to a contract administration office.
                (c) The contractor agrees:
                (1) to notify the contracting officer, simultaneously with its notification to SBA (as required by SBA's 8(a) regulations), when the owner or owners upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based, plan to relinquish ownership or control of the concern. Consistent with 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(21), transfer of ownership or control shall result in termination of the contract for convenience, unless SBA waives the requirement for termination prior to the actual relinquishing of control; and,
                (2) to adhere to the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.

                (b) A mentor or protégé must notify the OSDBU and the contracting officer, in writing, at least 30 calendar days in advance of the effective date of the firm's withdrawal from the Program. A mentor firm must notify the OSDBU and the contracting officer upon receipt of a protégé's notice of withdrawal from the Program.
                (c) Contracting officers may provide, as an incentive, a bonus score, not to exceed 5% of the relative importance assigned to the non-price factors.

                Minority and Women Inclusion (JAN 2016)
                (a) Contractor confirms its commitment to equal opportunity in employment and contracting. To implement this commitment, the Contractor shall ensure, to the maximum extent possible consistent with applicable law, the fair inclusion of minorities and women in its workforce. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in all subcontracts awarded under this contract whose dollar value exceeds $150,000. Within ten business days of a written request from the Contracting Officer, or such longer time as the Contracting Officer determines, and without any additional consideration required from the Agency, the Contractor shall provide documentation, satisfactory to the Agency, of the actions it (and as applicable, its subcontractors) has undertaken to demonstrate its good faith effort to comply with the aforementioned provisions. For purposes of this contract, “good faith effort” may include actions by the Contractor intended to identify and, if present, remove barriers to minority and women employment or expansion of employment opportunities for minorities and women within its workforce. Efforts to remove such barriers may include, but are not limited to, recruiting minorities and women, providing job-related training, or other activity that could lead to those results.
                (b) The documentation requested by the Contracting Officer to demonstrate “good faith effort” may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following—

                (1) The total number of Contractor's employees, and the number of minority and women employees, by race, ethnicity, and gender (e.g., an EEO-1);
                (2) A list of subcontract awards under the contract that includes: Dollar amount, date of award, and subcontractor's race, ethnicity, and/or gender ownership status;
                (3) Information similar to that required in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, with respect to each subcontractor; and/or
                (4) The Contractor's plan to ensure that minorities and women have appropriate opportunities to enter and advance within its workforce, including outreach efforts.
                (c) Consistent with Section 342(c)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub. L. 111-203) (Dodd-Frank Act), a failure to demonstrate to the Director of the Agency's Office of Minority and Women Inclusion such good faith efforts to include minorities and women in the Contractor's workforce (and as applicable, the workforce of its subcontractors), may result in termination of the contract for default, other contractual remedies, or referral to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). Compliance with this clause does not, however, necessarily satisfy the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended, nor does it preclude OFCCP compliance evaluations and/or enforcement actions undertaken pursuant to that Executive Order.
                (d) For purposes of this clause, the terms “minority,” “minority-owned business,” and “women-owned business” shall have the meanings set forth in Section 342(g) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on these item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the line items of the contract regardless of anything to the contrary in any other clause, including but not limited to the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government” or paragraph (1) entitled “Termination for the Government's Convenience” of the clause at FAR 52.212-4, “Commercial Terms and Conditions Commercial Items.”

The notification shall state the estimated date when that point will be reached and an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance. The notification shall also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this contract. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed upon substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the terms of this contract authorizing termination for the convenience of the Government. Failure to make the notification required by this paragraph, whether for reasons within or beyond the Contractor's control, will not increase the maximum amount payable to the Contractor under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause.
                (d) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.

                (e) The termination provisions of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default” or “Termination for Cause.” The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded.
                
                (f) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the Government's termination for convenience terms set forth in this contract.
                (g) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.
                (h) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract from time to time as the need arises and as funds become available. There is no fixed schedule for providing additional funds.

                (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests electronically using the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP). Information regarding IPP, including IPP Customer Support contact information, is available at www.ipp.gov or any successor site.
                (c) The Contractor may submit payment requests using other than IPP only when the Contracting Officer authorizes alternate procedures in writing in accordance with Treasury procedures.
                (d) If alternate payment procedures are authorized, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officer's written authorization with each payment request.

              Purpose.
              The Department of Transportation (DOT) Acquisition Regulation (TAR) establishes uniform acquisition policies and procedures, which implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
            
            
              1201.104
              Applicability.
              (a) Statute, the (FAR) Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapter 1, and (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 apply to all acquisitions within the Department unless otherwise excluded by statute, the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1, or (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12.
              (b) The following order of precedence applies to resolve any question of applicability concerning an acquisition regulation or a procedure found within (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 or the Transportation Acquisition Manual (TAM):
              (1) Statute;
              (2) (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 or other applicable regulation;
              (3) (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12;
              (4) DOT Orders; and
              (5) TAM.
              (c) The Maritime Administration may depart from the requirements of the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 and (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 as authorized by 40 U.S.C. 113(e)(15) but shall adhere to those regulations to the maximum extent practicable. Exceptions from the requirements of the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 and/or (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 shall be documented according to Maritime Administration procedures or in each contract file, as appropriate.
              (d) The (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1, (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 and TAM do not apply to the Federal Aviation Administration as provided by the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996, Public Law 104-50, unless otherwise directed by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.

              (e) For purposes of the (FAR), (TAR) and (TAM), the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (formerly the Research and Innovative Technology Administration; see Public Law 113-76; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014) shall have the same authority as an Operating Administration as defined in (TAR) 1202.1, and the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology shall have the same authority as a Head of the Operating Administration as defined in (TAR) 1202.1

              Publication and code arrangement.
              (a) The (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 is published in:
              (1) The Federal Register; and
              (2) Cumulative form in the CFR.
              (b) The TAR is issued as chapter 12 of Title 48 of the CFR.
            
            
              1201.105-2
              Arrangement of regulations.
              (a) General. The (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, which encompasses both Department and Operating Administration (OA)/Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R)-specific guidance (see (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.3), conforms with the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by (FAR) 48 CFR 1.104. Guidance that is OA/OST-R-specific contains the OA/OST-R's acronym directly after the heading. The following acronyms apply:
              
              FHWA—Federal Highway Administration
              FMCSA—Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
              FRA—Federal Railroad Administration
              FTA—Federal Transit Administration
              MARAD—Maritime Administration
              NHTSA—National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
              OST—Office of the Secretary OST-R—Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology
              PHMSA—Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration
              SLSDC—Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation
              
              (b) Numbering—(1) Departmentwide guidance. (i) The numbering illustrations at (FAR) 48 CFR 1.105-2 apply to (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12.
              (ii) Coverage within (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 is identified by the prefix “12” followed by the complete (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 cite. For example, (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.201-1(b)).
              (iii) Coverage in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 that supplements (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 will use part, subpart, section and subsection numbers ending in “70” through “89” (e.g., (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.301-70). A series of numbers beginning with “70” is used for provisions and clauses.
              (iv) Coverage in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, other than that identified with a “70” or higher number, that implements the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 uses the identical number sequence and caption of the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 segment being implemented, which may be to the paragraph level. Paragraph numbers and letters are not always shown sequentially, but may be shown by the specific FAR paragraph implemented. For example, (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.201-1 contains only paragraph (b) because only this paragraph, correlated with FAR, implements (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12.
              (2) Operating Administration-unique guidance. Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 or (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 shall be identified using chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers of “90” and higher.
              (c) References and citations. (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 may be referred to as the Department of Transportation Acquisition Regulation or the TAR. Cross reference to the FAR in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will be cited by “FAR” followed by the FAR numbered cite, and cross reference to the TAM in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will be cited by “TAM” followed by the TAM numbered cite. References to specific cites within (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will be referenced by the numbered cite only.

              OMB Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act.
              (a) Data collection by regulation. The information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
              (b) Data collection under proposed contracts. Under the regulations implementing the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (5 CFR 1320), OMB must approve, prior to obligation of funds, proposed contracts which require the collection of information from ten or more non-Federal persons or entities.

            Subpart 1201.3—Agency Acquisition Regulations
            
              1201.301
              Policy.
              (a)(1) Acquisition regulations—(i) Departmentwide acquisition regulations. The Department of Transportation's (DOT's) Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) is the individual having authority to issue or authorize the issuance of agency regulations that implement or supplement the FAR and to include agency-unique policies, etc. that govern the contracting process. This authority was re-delegated from the Assistant Secretary for Administration.
              (ii) Operating Administration (OA) acquisition regulations. OA acquisition regulations, and any changes thereto, shall be reviewed and approved by the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) for insertion into the (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 as a TAR supplemental regulation before the SPE submits the proposed coverage for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 1.501. OA regulations may be more restrictive or require higher approval levels than those permitted by (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 unless otherwise specified.
              (2) Acquisition procedures. The SPE is the individual who issues or authorizes the issuance of internal agency guidance at any organizational level. DOT internal operating procedures are contained in the Transportation Acquisition Manual (TAM). OA procedures necessary to implement or supplement the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1, (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, or TAM may be issued by the Head of the Contracting Agency (HCA), who may delegate this authority to any organizational level deemed appropriate. OA procedures may be more restrictive or require higher approval levels than those permitted by the TAM unless otherwise specified.

              (b) The authority of the agency head under (FAR) 48 CFR 1.301(b) to establish procedures to ensure that agency acquisition regulations are published for comment in the Federal Register in conformance with the procedures in FAR Subpart 1.5 is delegated to the Office of the General Counsel, Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and Enforcement (C-50).
            
            
              1201.301-70
              Amendment of (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12.
              (a) Changes to the regulation may be the result of recommendations from internal DOT personnel, other Government agencies, or the public. Changes shall be submitted in the following format to the Office of the Senior Procurement Executive (OSPE), 400 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590:
              (1) Problem: Succinctly state the problems created by current (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 language and describe the factual or legal reasons necessitating regulatory change.
              (2) Recommendation: Identify the recommended change by using the current language (if applicable), and crossing out the deleted words with a horizontal line. Insert proposed language in brackets. If the change is extensive, deleted language may be displayed by forming a box with diagonal lines connecting the corners.
              (3) Discussion: Explain why the change is necessary and how it will solve the problem. Address any cost or administrative impact on Government activities, offerors, and contractors. Provide any other information and documents such as statutes, legal decisions, regulations, reports, etc., that may be helpful.
              (4) Point of contact: Provide a point of contact who can answer questions regarding the recommendation.
              (b) The (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 is maintained by the SPE through the TAR/TAM change process. This process consists of input from various DOT elements including representatives from DOT OAs specifically designated to formulate Departmental acquisition policies and procedures.
              (1) Transportation Acquisition Circular (TAC). TACs (see (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.301-72) will be used to amend (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12.
              (2) TAR Notice (TN). (i) TNs shall be issued when interim guidance is necessary and as often as may be necessary, under any of the following circumstances:
              (A) To quickly promulgate selected material in a general or narrative manner, in advance of a TAC issuance;
              (B) To disseminate other acquisition related information; or
              (C) To issue guidance which may be effective for a period of 1 year or less.
              (ii) Each TN will expire by a specific date.
            
            
              1201.301-71
              Effective date.
              Unless otherwise stated, the following applies—
              (a) Statements in TACs or TNs to the effect that the material therein is “effective upon receipt,” “upon a specified date,” or that changes set forth in the document are “to be used upon receipt,” mean that any new or revised provisions, clauses, procedures, or forms must be included in solicitations, contracts or modifications issued thereafter; and
              (b) Unless expressly directed by statute or regulation, solicitations in process or completed negotiations when the TAC or TN is received, new information such as forms and clauses, need not be included if the chief of the contracting office determines that it would not be in the best interest of the Government to include the new information.
            
            
              1201.301-72
              TAC or TN numbering.
              TACs and TNs will be numbered consecutively on a fiscal year basis beginning with number “01” prefixed by the last two digits of the fiscal year (e.g., TNs 04-01 and 04-02 indicate the first two TNs issued in fiscal year 2004).
            
            
              1201.304
              Agency control and compliance procedures.
              (a) DOT shall control the proliferation of acquisition regulations and any revisions thereto (except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section) by using an internal (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 change process that involves input from many DOT elements including OA representatives on the Procurement Management Council. The OA member shall represent their OA's viewpoint along with Departmentwide considerations in reaching a decision on (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 changes.
              (b) OA-unique regulations will not be processed through the TAR/TAM change process, but shall be reviewed by OA legal counsel and submitted to the OSPE for review and approval. (See (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.101 for additional instructions pertaining to provisions and clauses.)

              1201.403
              Individual deviations.
              The Head of the Contracting Activity, or designee with a rank that is no lower than that of Senior Executive Service (SES) official or that of a Flag Officer, may authorize individual deviations (unless (FAR) 48 CFR 1.405(e) applies). However, see TAM 1201.403.
            
            
              1201.404
              Class deviations.

              The SPE may grant in writing class deviations from the (FAR) 48 CFR chapter 1 and (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, unless (FAR) 48 CFR 1.405(e) applies.

              1201.602-3
              Ratification of unauthorized commitments.
              (b) Policy. DOT policy requires that all procurement decisions shall be made only by Government officials having authority to carry out such acquisitions. Procurement decisions made by other than authorized personnel are contrary to Departmental policy and may be considered matters of serious misconduct on the part of the employee making an unauthorized commitment. Disciplinary action against an employee who makes an unauthorized commitment may be considered.
            
            
              1201.603-1
              General.

              1213.7100
              Applicability.
              (a) DOT policy at (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.7000 also applies to the Standard Form (SF) 182, Request, Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training, which may be used to acquire training services; however, the policy does not apply to training services acquired by the Government purchase/credit card. The Government purchase/credit card can only be used to acquire training services valued at $2,500 or less.
              (b) As reflected in (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.7002, this policy does not apply to training attended by DOT employees which is scheduled and conducted by Government sources of supply, educational institutions, or private entities where DOT does not control or sponsor the training. Examples of when the policy does and does not apply include:
              (1) When SF 182s are issued for three DOT employees to attend a one week course at a university or other private entity, the policy does not apply. DOT does not control this course because the university or private entity has a contract in place with the training provider and DOT is placing an order under an existing contract; and
              (2) When DOT awards a contract to a university or other private entity to provide training for DOT and/or other Government personnel, the policy applies. DOT controls this course; therefore, no soliciting or advertising of private non-Government training while conducting the contracted-for training is permitted.
            
            
              1213.7101
              Solicitation provision and contract clause.

              (a) Contracting officers shall insert the provision at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.237-71, Certification of Data, in all solicitations and requests for quotations, and the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.237-72, Prohibition on Advertising, in solicitations, requests for quotations, and all contracts (e.g., purchase orders, SF 182s) for training services when the content and/or presentation of the training is controlled by DOT. (Notice: The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the certification required by (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.237-71 shall be retained in accordance with Section 4301(b)(1)(B)(i)(II) of the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (Public Law 104-106, 41 U.S.C. 425, note) and DOT Memorandum dated July 17, 1996.)
              (b) Contracting officers shall incorporate the successful offeror's certified data into any resultant contract(s). Certified data may be adopted by reference, if the contracting officer determines it contains information sufficient to reliably describe the certified data submitted. For example, this type of information includes dated material such as resumes and company or personnel qualifications.

              Policy.
              DOT's policy encourages submission of new and innovative ideas that will support DOT's mission. Through the various Operating Administrations (OAs), DOT is responsible for transportation safety improvements, international transportation agreements and the continuity of transportation services in the public interest.
            
            
              1215.603
              General.
              DOT will accept unsolicited proposals from any entity for review and consideration. However, DOT will not pay any costs associated with the preparation of these proposals. Proposals that do not meet the definition and applicable content and marking requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 15.6 will not be considered under any circumstances and will be returned to the submitter.
            
            
              1215.604
              Agency points of contact.
              (a) The DOT does not have a centralized location to receive unsolicited proposals. The type of effort submitted in the proposal determines which DOT OA should receive and evaluate the proposal.

              (b) Unsolicited proposals should be submitted to the responsible OA contracting office for appropriate handling. Specific information concerning the mission of each DOT OA is available on the worldwide web at http://www.dot.gov. Prospective contractors are urged to contact these contracting/procurement offices prior to submitting a proposal to ensure that the unsolicited proposal reaches the correct contracting office for action. This action will reduce unnecessary paperwork and wasted time for both the Government and the prospective contractors.
            
            
              1215.606
              Agency procedures.

              (a) The Chief of the Contracting Office is responsible for establishing procedures for controlling unsolicited proposals received in the contracting office. Within ten working days after receipt of an unsolicited proposal, the contracting office shall review the proposal and determine whether the proposal meets the content and marking requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 15.6. If the proposal does not meet these requirements, it shall be returned to the submitter giving the reasons for noncompliance.
              (b) The OA contracting office is the designated point of contact for receipt and handling of unsolicited proposals. Persons within DOT who receive unsolicited proposals, such as technical personnel, shall forward the document to their responsible contracting office.
            
            
              1215.606-1
              Receipt and initial review.
              (a) The agency contact point must make an initial review determination within seven calendar days after receiving a proposal.
              (b) If the proposal meets the requirements at (FAR) 48 CFR 15.606-1(a), the agency contact point must acknowledge receipt within three calendar days after making the initial review determination and advise the offeror of the general timeframe for completing the evaluation.
              (c) If the proposal does not meet the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 15.606-1(a), the agency contact point must return the proposal within three calendar days after making the determination. The agency point of contact must inform the offeror, in writing, of the reasons for returning the proposal.
            
            
              1215.606-2
              Evaluation.
              (a) Comprehensive evaluations should be completed within sixty calendar days after making the initial review determination. If additional time is needed, then the agency contact point shall advise the offeror accordingly and provide a new evaluation completion date. The evaluating office must neither reproduce nor disseminate the proposal to other offices without the consent of the contracting office from which the proposal was received for evaluation. If additional information from the offeror is required by the evaluating office, the evaluator must convey this request to the responsible contracting office. The evaluator shall not directly contact the proposal originator.
              (b) If the evaluator recommends acceptance of the proposal, the responsible contracting officer shall ensure compliance with all of the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 15.607.

              Clauses.
              (a) The clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-70, Guarantee, shall be used where general guarantee provisions are deemed desirable by the contracting officer.
              (1) When inspection and acceptance tests will afford full protection to the Government in ascertaining conformance to specifications and the absence of defects and deficiencies, no guarantee clause for that purpose shall be included in the contract.
              (2) The customary guarantee period, to be inserted in the first sentence of the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-70, Guarantee, is 60 days. In certain instances, it may be advisable for the contracting officer to include a contract clause for a guarantee period longer than 60 days. These instances are as follows:
              (i) If, as result of a full inquiry, the contracting officer determines that there will be no increased costs as a result of a longer guarantee period, the contracting officer may substitute guarantee longer than the usual 60 days; or
              (ii) When the contracting officer's inquiry discloses that increased costs will result or are expected to result from a longer guarantee period, the contracting officer shall submit a letter to the Chief of the Contracting Office, requesting approval for use of guarantee period in excess of 60 days. The letter must contain sufficient facts to justify the use of a longer guarantee period. Upon approval, the contracting officer may insert a longer period in the first sentence of the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-70, Guarantee.
              (b) The following clauses are required:

              (1) (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-71 through (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-74; and,
              
              (2) (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-76 through (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-80.
              (c) (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-75 may be included in sealed bid fixed-price solicitations and contracts for vessel repair, alteration, or conversion which are to be performed within the United States, its possessions, or Puerto Rico.
              (d) Unless inappropriate, the clauses set forth in (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-71 through (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-74 and (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-76 through (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-80 shall be included.
              (e) (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-75 may be included in negotiated solicitations and contracts to be performed outside the United States.

              (1) Actions must be appealed within 30 days of receipt of the written statement required by (FAR) 48 CFR 27.304-5(a). The contractor must present all pertinent arguments in the appeal along with documentary evidence, if any.
              (2) The HCA shall issue a determination within 45 days from the date the contractor's appeal is received.
              (c) Appeals of decisions rendered under (FAR) 48 CFR 27.304-5(a)(2) are subject to the following requirements:
              (1) Actions must be appealed within 30 days of receipt of the written statement required by (FAR) 48 CFR 27.304-5(a). The contractor must present all pertinent arguments in the appeal along with documentary evidence, if any.
              (2) The HCA may hold an informal hearing if deemed appropriate or at the request of the contractor. The informal hearing shall be held after all fact-finding is completed.
              (i) If a hearing is held, there shall be a transcribed record of the same. A copy of the transcript shall be available to the contractor at cost.
              (ii) Transcription of the hearing may be waived by mutual agreement of the parties.
              (3) The HCA shall designate an impartial fact-finding official. The official conducting the fact-finding shall prepare findings of fact and transmit them to the HCA promptly after the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding along with a recommended determination.

              (i) A copy of the findings of fact shall be sent to the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) by registered or certified mail. The contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) and agency representatives will be given 30 days to submit written arguments to the HCA; and, upon request by the contractor oral arguments will be held before the HCA as part of an informal hearing. The HCA will make the final determination as to whether the initial agency action was appropriate under the relevant laws and procedures (See 1227.304-5(c)(4)).
              (ii) Any portion of the informal hearing that involves testimony or evidence shall be closed to the public. Agencies shall not disclose any such information obtained in the course of the appeal to persons outside the government except when such release is authorized by the contractor (assignee or licensee).

              (4) The HCA's final determination shall be based on the findings of facts, together with any other information and written or oral arguments submitted by the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) and agency representatives, and any other information in the administrative record. The HCA may reject only those facts that have been found clearly erroneous and must explicitly state the rejection and the basis for the contrary finding. The HCA shall provide the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) a written determination by certified or registered mail no later than 90 days after fact-finding is completed or no later than 90 days after oral arguments, whichever is later.

              Furnishing of information.
              (b) When furnishing surety information, the inquirer should also be informed that:
              (1) Persons believing that they have legal remedies under the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 3131-3134) are cautioned to consult their own legal advisor regarding the proper steps to take to obtain remedies.
              (2) On construction contracts exceeding $2,000, if the contracting officer is informed (through routine compliance checking, a complaint, or a request for information) that a laborer, mechanic, apprentice, trainee, watchman, or guard employed by the contractor or subcontractor at any tier may have been paid wages less than those required by the applicable labor standards provisions of the contract, the contracting officer shall promptly initiate an investigation in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR subpart 22.4, irrespective of the employee's rights under the Miller Act. When an employee's request for information is involved, the contracting officer shall inform the inquirer that such investigation will be made. To insure proper payment to such employees, this investigation is required pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3141), and Copeland (Anti-Kickback) Act (41 U.S.C. 51-58).

              (c) When furnishing a copy of a payment bond and contract in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 28.106-6(b), the requirement for a copy of the contract may be satisfied by furnishing a machine-duplicate copy of the contractor's first pages which show the contract number and date, the contractor's name and signature, the contracting officer's signature, and the description of the contract work. The contracting officer furnishing the copies shall place the statement “Certified to be a true and correct copy” followed by his/her signature, title and name of the OA. The fee for furnishing the requested certified copies shall be determined in accordance with the DOT Freedom of Information Act regulation, 49 CFR part 7, (TAR) 48 CFR 1224.203).

              (a) The contracting officer shall notify the surety within 30 days, of the contractor's failure to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.
              (b) When a partnership is a principal on a bond, the names of all the members of the firm shall be listed in the bond following the name of the firm, and the phrase “a partnership composed of.” If a principal is a corporation, the state of incorporation must also appear on the bond.
              (c) Performance or payment bond(s), other than an annual bond, shall not predate the contract to which it pertains.
              (d) Bonds may be filed with the original contract to which they apply, or all bonds can be separately maintained and reviewed quarterly for validity. If separately maintained, each contract file shall cross-reference the applicable bonds.

              1228.106-7100
              Waiver.

              (a) Pursuant to the authority vested in the Secretary of Transportation by the Miller Act, the requirements of 40 U.S.C. 3131 et seq. are waived, to the extent authorized in 40 U.S.C. 3134(b), with respect to contracts for the construction, alteration, or repair of vessels when the contract is made under sections 1535 and 1536 of Title 31, the Merchant Marine Act 1936 (46 App. U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), or the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 (50 App. U.S.C. 1735 et seq.), regardless of the terms of the contracts as to payment or title.
              (b) The Miller Act's requirement that certain contracts have payment bonds in place in order to protect the public, including the Government, material, men and laborers is not generally necessary with respect to the classes of contracts described under (TAR) 48 CFR 1228.106-7100(a). Inasmuch as the Government would directly or indirectly bear the burden of premiums for performance and payment bonds obtained in connection with such contracts, a substantial savings can be made by waiving the requirement that they be obtained. However, unusual circumstances may arise in which either payment or performance bonds, or both, will be advantageous in connection with certain such contracts.
            
            
              1228.106-7101
              Exception.
              A performance and payment bond for the contracts described under (TAR) 48 CFR 1228.106-7100(a) may be advantageous in view of unusual circumstances arising in connection with such contracts. Requests for the authority to include the requirement for either a performance or payment bond, or both in the contracts described under (TAR) 48 CFR 1228.106-7100(a) shall be submitted by the contracting officer to the HCA, before a solicitation is issued.

              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clauses at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.228-70 through 1252.228-72, unless otherwise indicated by the specific instructions for their use, in any contract for the lease of aircraft (including aircraft used in out-service flight training).
              (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.228-70, Loss of or Damage to Leased Aircraft, in any contract for the lease of aircraft, except in the following circumstances:

              (1) When the hourly rental rate does not exceed $250 and the total rental cost for any single transaction is not in excess of $2,500:
              
              (2) When the cost of hull insurance does not exceed 10 percent of the contract rate; or
              (3) When the lessor's insurer does not grant a credit for uninsured hours, thereby preventing the lessor from granting the same to the Government.
              (c) The contracting officer must insert the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.228-71, Fair Market Value of Aircraft, when fair market value of the aircraft can be determined.
              (d) 49 U.S.C. provides that an aircraft lessor under a lease of 30 days or more is not liable for injury or death of persons, or damage or loss of property unless the aircraft is in the actual possession or control of the lessor and the damage occurs because of the aircraft engine, propeller or the flight of, or an object falling from the aircraft, engine or propeller.

              Precontract costs.
              (a) The decision to incur precontract costs is that of the contractor. No DOT employee can authorize, demand, or require a contractor to incur precontract costs. The contracting officer may advise the prospective contractor that any costs incurred before contract award are at the contractor's sole risk and that if negotiations fail to result in a binding contract, payment of these costs may not be made by the Government.
              (b) When the contracting officer determines that incurring precontract costs was necessary to meet the proposed contract delivery schedule of a cost-reimbursement contract, the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.231-70, Date of Incurrence of Costs, may be inserted in the resultant contract.

              Appendix B to Part 1232—Instructions for Completing the SF 1035
              The SF 1035, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal (Continuation Sheet), shall be completed in accordance with the below instructions.
              1. Use the same basic instructions for the SF 1035 as used for the SF 1034. Ensure that the contract and, if applicable, order number, are shown on each continuation sheet. Use as many sheets as necessary to show the information required by the contract, contracting officer, or responsible audit agency; however, if more than one sheet of SF 1035 is used, each sheet shall be in numerical sequence.
              2. The following items are generally entered below the line with Number and Date of Order; Date of Delivery or Service; Articles or Services; Quantity; Unit Price; and Amount (but do not necessarily tie to these captions).
              3. Description of data to be inserted as it applies to the contract or order number.
              a. Show, as applicable, the target or estimated costs, target or fixed-fee, and total contract value, as adjusted by any modifications to the contract or order. The FAR permits the contracting officer to withhold a percentage of fixed fee until a reserve is set aside in an amount that is considered necessary to protect the Government's interest.
              b. Show the following costs and supporting data (as applicable) to the contract or order:
              (1) Direct Labor. List each labor category, rate per labor hour, hours worked, and extended total labor dollars per labor category.
              (2) Premium Pay/Overtime. List each labor category, rate per labor hour, hours worked, and the extended total labor dollars per labor category. Note: Advance written authorization must be received from the contracting officer to work overtime or to pay premium rates; therefore, identify the contracting officer's written authorization to the contractor.
              
              (3) Fringe Benefits. If fringe benefits are included in the overhead pool, no entry is required. If the contract allows for a separate fringe benefit pool, cite the formula (rate and base) in effect during the time the costs were incurred. If the contract allows for billing fringe benefits as a direct expense, show the actual fringe benefit costs.
              (4) Materials, Supplies, Equipment. Show those items normally treated as direct costs. Expendable items need not be itemized and may be grouped into major classifications such as office supplies. However, items valued at $5,000 or more must be itemized. See (FAR) 48 CFR part 45, Government Property, for reporting of property.
              (5) Travel. List the name and title of traveler, place of travel, and travel dates. If the travel claim is based on the actual costs expended, show the amount for the mode of travel (i.e., airline, private auto, taxi, etc.), lodging, meals, and other incidental expenses separately, on a daily basis. These actual costs must be supported with receipts to substantiate the costs paid. Travel costs for consultants must be shown separately and also supported.
              (6) Other Direct Costs. Itemize those costs that cannot be placed in categories (1) through (5) above. Categorize these costs to the extent possible.
              (7) Total Direct Costs. Cite the sum of categories (1) through (6) above.
              (8) Overhead. Cite the rate, base, and extended amount.
              (9) G&A Expense. Cite the rate, base, and extended amount.
              (10) Total Costs. Cite the sum of categories (7) through (9) above.
              (11) Fee. Cite the rate, base, and extended amount.
              (12) Total Cost and Fee Claimed. Enter this amount on the SF 1034.
              Completion Voucher
              The completion (final) voucher is the last voucher to be submitted for incurred, allocable, and allowable costs expended to perform the contract or order. This voucher should include all contract reserves, allowable cost withholdings, balance of fixed fee, etc. However, the amount of the completion voucher when added to the total amount previously paid cannot exceed the total amount of the contract.

              (c) The Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADRA) of 1990, Public Law 101-552, as reauthorized by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADRA) of 1996, Public Law 104-320, authorizes and encourages agencies to use mediation, conciliation, arbitration, and other techniques for the prompt and informal resolution of disputes, either before or after appeal, and for other purposes. ADR procedures may be used when:

              (1) There is mutual consent by the parties to participate in the ADR process (with consent being obtained either before or after an issue in controversy has arisen);
              
              (2) Prior to the submission of a claim; and
              (3) In resolution of a formal claim. Use of ADR shall be coordinated with counsel. For all matters filed with the DOTBCA, the DOTBCA Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) procedures contained in 48 CFR Chapter 63, Section 6302.30, ADR Methods (Rule 30), will be distributed to the parties, if ADR procedures are used.
              (d) Pursuant to the ADRA, DOT has appointed a Dispute Resolution Specialist, who is responsible for the operations of the Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution, (C-4). The Center may provide an internal DOT neutral agreeable to the parties to conduct any of the alternative means of dispute resolution set forth in the ADRA, 5 U.S.C. 571(3) on a non-reimbursable basis for DOT operating administrations and their contracting partners. Alternative means of dispute resolution include settlement negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, fact finding, mini-trials, and arbitration, or any combination of these methods. The Center may also arrange for an external public or private neutral at the parties' expense.

              1237.7000
              Policy.
              When training services are provided under contract, DOT policy requires that all prospective contractors:
              (a) Certify that the data provided concerning company qualifications, background statements, etc., is current, accurate, and complete; and
              (b) Agree to not solicit or advertise private, non-Government training while conducting a training course.
            
            
              1237.7001
              Certification of data.
              Towards fulfilling DOT's policy at (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.7000(a), contracting officers shall request information from prospective contractors for certification purposes. The type of information requested is dependent upon the criticality of the service and/or any unique or essential qualification requirements.
            
            
              1237.7002
              Applicability.
              The policy at (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.7000 applies to all contracts (as defined in FAR 2.101) awarded by DOT for training services when DOT controls the content and/or presentation of the course. This policy does not apply to courses attended by DOT employees that are offered and sponsored by Government sources of supply, educational institutions, or private entities where DOT does not control the course content or presentation. (See (TAR) 48 CFR 1213.7100 for examples.)

              (b) Contracting officers shall incorporate the successful offeror's certified data into any resultant contract(s). Certified data may be adopted by reference, if the contracting officer determines it contains sufficient descriptive information (i.e., dated material such as resumes, company and/or personnel qualifications) to reliably describe the certified data submitted.

              (1) The contractor shall not be required to honor the warranty on any property furnished by the Government except for:
              (i) Defects in installation; and
              (ii) Installation or modification in such a manner that invalidates a warranty provided by the manufacturer of the property.
              (2) Any warranty obtained shall specifically exclude coverage of damage in time of war (combat damage) or national emergency.
              (3) Contracting officers shall not include in a warranty clause any terms that require the contractor to incur liability for loss, damage, or injury to third parties.

              1246.706
              Warranty terms and conditions.
              (a) When appropriate and cost effective, the contracting officer shall comply with the following requirements when developing the warranty terms and conditions:
              (1) Identify the affected line item(s) and the applicable specification(s);
              (2) Require that the line item's design and manufacture will conform to:

              (i) An identified revision of a top-level drawing; and/or
              
              (ii) An identified specification or revision thereof;
              (3) Require that the line item conform to the specified Government performance requirements;
              (4) Require that all line items and components delivered under the contract will be free from defects in materials and workmanship;
              (5) State that if the contractor fails to comply with specification or there are defects in material and workmanship, the contractor will bear the cost of all work necessary to achieve the specified performance requirements, including repair and/or replacement of all parts;
              (6) Require the timely replacement/repair of warranted items and specify lead times for replacement/repair where possible;
              (7) Identify the specific paragraphs containing Government performance requirements that the contractor must meet;
              (8) Ensure that any performance requirements identified as goals or objectives beyond specification requirements are excluded from the warranty provision;
              (9) Specify what constitutes the start of the warranty period (e.g., delivery, acceptance, in-service date), the ending of the warranty (e.g., passing a test or demonstration, or operation without failure for a specified time period), and circumstances requiring an extension of warranty duration (e.g., extending the warranty period as a result of mass defect correction during warranty period);
              (10) Identify what transportation costs will be paid by the contractor in relation to the warranty coverage;
              (11) In addition to combat damage, identify any conditions which will not be covered by the warranty, and
              (12) Identify any limitation on the total dollar amount of the contractor's warranty exposure, or agreement to share costs after a certain dollar threshold to avoid unnecessary warranty returns.
              (b) In addition to the terms and conditions listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the contracting officer shall consider the following when a warranty clause is being used for a major acquisition:
              (1) For line items or components which are commercially available, obtaining a warranty as is normally provided by the manufacturer or supplier, in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 46.703(d) and (FAR) 48 CFR 46.710(b)(2).
              (2) Obtaining a warranty of compliance with the stated requirements for line items or components provided in accordance with either design and manufacturing or performance requirements as specified in the contract or any modification to that contract.
              (3) The warranty provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall provide that in the event the line items or any components thereof fails to meet the terms of the warranty provided, the contracting officer may:
              (i) Require the contractor to promptly take such corrective action as the contracting officer determines to be necessary at no additional cost to the Government, including repairing or replacing all parts necessary to achieve the requirements set forth in the contract;
              (ii) Require the contractor to pay costs reasonably incurred by the United States in taking necessary corrective action; or
              (iii) Equitably reduce the contract price.
              (4) Inserting remedies, exclusions, limitations and durations, provided these are consistent with the specific requirements of this subpart and (FAR) 48 CFR 46.706.
              (5) Excluding from the terms of the warranty certain defects for specified supplies (exclusions) and limiting the contractor's liability under the terms of the warranty (limitations), as appropriate, if necessary to derive a cost-effective warranty in light of the technical risk, contractor financial risk, or other program uncertainties.
              (6) Structuring of a broader and more comprehensive warranty where such is advantageous. Likewise, the contracting officer may narrow the scope of a warranty when appropriate (e.g., where it would be inequitable to require a warranty of all performance requirements because a contractor had not designed the system).

              (c) Any contract that contains a warranty clause must contain warranty implementation procedures, including warranty notification content and procedures, and identify the individuals responsible for implementation of warranty provisions. The contract may also permit the contractor's participation in investigation of system failures, providing that the contractor is reimbursed at established rates for fault isolation work, and that the Government receive credit for any payments where equipment failure is covered by warranty provisions.

                (f) Activity sanctions or corrective actions. Upon receipt of the investigative reports from the contractor, the DOT oversight organization, in conjunction with the contracting officer, will review the report and determine the appropriate administrative action to be taken. In deciding what actions to take, the oversight organizations should consider: the severity of the misconduct; the degree to which the misconduct was knowing, intentional or reckless; and whether it was an isolated event or part of a pattern. Sanctions or corrective actions may range as follows:
                (1) Minimal restrictions—such as a letter of reprimand, additional conditions on awards, requiring third-party certification of accuracy or compliance with particular policies, regulations, guidelines, or special terms and conditions;
                
                (2) Moderate restrictions—such as limitations on certain activities or expenditures under an active award, or special reviews of requests for funding;
                (3) More severe restrictions—such as termination of an active award, or government-wide suspension or debarment.
                (i) When the DOT oversight organization concludes an investigation with a determination of research misconduct, the DOT Office of the Senior Procurement Executive may notify any other sources of research that provide support to the respondent that a finding of research misconduct has been made.
                (ii) If there are reasonable indications that criminal violations may have occurred, the DOT oversight organization shall consult with the Office of Inspector General to determine an appropriate course of action, including disbarment or suspension. The DOT oversight organization will notify the respondent in writing of its action, sanctions to be imposed if applicable, and the DOT appeal procedures.
                (g) Appeals and Final Administrative Action. (1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) governs in all matters pertaining to termination of the contract, and suspension/debarment.
                (2) In all other cases, the contractor may appeal the sanction or corrective action through the DOT Research and Technology Coordinating Council (RTCC) to the Deputy Secretary of Transportation, in writing within 30 calendar days after receiving written notification of the research misconduct finding and associated administrative action(s). The contractor shall mail a copy of the appeal to the contracting officer.
                (3) If there is no request for appeal within 30 calendar days, the administrative actions of the oversight organization shall be final.
                (4) If a request for appeal is received by the RTCC within the 30 calendar day limit, the Deputy Secretary may have the RTCC review the appeal and make recommendations.
                (5) The RTCC on behalf of the Deputy Secretary will normally inform the appellant of the final decision on an appeal within 60 calendar days of receipt. This decision will then be the final DOT administrative action.
                (h) Criminal or Civil Fraud Violations. When the oversight organization concludes an investigation with a determination of research misconduct, the DOT Office of the Senior Procurement Executive may notify any other sources of research that provide support to the respondent. If criminal or civil fraud violations may have occurred, the oversight organization should promptly refer the matter to the DOT Inspector General, the Department of Justice or other appropriate investigative body.

                (2) Acquisition, transmission or analysis of data owned by DOT with significant replacement cost should the contractor's copy be corrupted; and
                (3) Access to DOT general support systems/major applications at a level beyond that granted the general public, e.g. bypassing a firewall.
                (b) The Contractor shall develop, provide, implement, and maintain an IT Security Plan. This plan shall describe the processes and procedures that will be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources that are developed, processed, or used under this contract.

The plan, as accepted by the Contracting Officer, shall be incorporated into the contract as a compliance document. The Contractor shall comply with the accepted plan.
                (d) Within 6 months after contract award, the contractor shall submit written proof of IT Security accreditation to the DOT for acceptance by the DOT Contracting Officer. Such written proof may be furnished either by the Contractor or by a third party. Accreditation must be in accordance with DOT Order 1350.2, which is available from the Contracting Officer upon request. This accreditation will include a final security plan, risk assessment, security test and evaluation, and disaster recovery plan/continuity of operations plan. This accreditation, when accepted by the Contracting Officer, shall be incorporated into the contract as a compliance document, and shall include a final security plan, a risk assessment, security test and evaluation, and disaster recovery/continuity of operations plan. The contractor shall comply with the accepted accreditation documentation.
                (e) On an annual basis, the contractor shall submit verification to the Contracting Officer that the IT Security Plan remains valid.
                (f) The contractor will ensure that the following banners are displayed on all DOT systems (both public and private) operated by the contractor prior to allowing anyone access to the system:
                Government Warning
                **WARNING**WARNING**WARNING**
                Unauthorized access is a violation of U.S. Law and Department of Transportation policy, and may result in criminal or administrative penalties. Users shall not access other user's or system files without proper authority. Absence of access controls IS NOT authorization for access! DOT information systems and related equipment are intended for communication, transmission, processing and storage of U.S. Government information. These systems and equipment are subject to monitoring by law enforcement and authorized Department officials. Monitoring may result in the acquisition, recording, and analysis of all data being communicated, transmitted, processed or stored in this system by law enforcement and authorized Department officials. Use of this system constitutes consent to such monitoring.
                **WARNING**WARNING**WARNING**
                (g) The contractor will ensure that the following banner is displayed on all DOT systems that contain Privacy Act information operated by the contractor prior to allowing anyone access to the system:
                This system contains information protected under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-579). Any privacy information displayed on the screen or printed shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure. Employees who violate privacy safeguards may be subject to disciplinary actions, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.
                (h) Contractor personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to systems operated by the Contractor for DOT or interconnected to a DOT network shall be screened at an appropriate level in accordance with DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management, as it may be amended from time to time during the term of this contract.
                (i) The Contractor shall ensure that its employees, in performance of the contract performing under this contract, receive annual IT security training in accordance with OMB Circular A-130, FISMA, and NIST requirements, as they may be amended from time to time during the term of this contract, with a specific emphasis on rules of behavior.
                (j) The Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor's and subcontractors' facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases and personnel used in performance of the contract. Access shall be provided to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection (to include vulnerability testing), investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of DOT data or to the function of information technology systems operated on behalf of DOT, and to preserve evidence of computer crime.
                (k) The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts that meet the conditions in paragraph (a) of this clause.
                (l) The contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer when an employee terminates employment that has access to DOT information systems or data.

The Contractor, therefore, may publish (subject to the provisions of the “Data Rights” and “Patent Rights” clauses of the contract) research results in professional journals, books, trade publications, or other appropriate media (a thesis or collection of theses should not be used to distribute results because dissemination will not be sufficiently widespread). All costs of publication pursuant to this clause shall be borne by the Contractor and shall not be charged to the Government under this or any other Federal contract.
                (b) Any copy of material published under this clause must contain acknowledgment of DOT's sponsorship of the research effort and a disclaimer stating that the published material represents the position of the author(s) and not necessarily that of DOT.

However, two copies of each article shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer at least two weeks prior to release or publication.
                (c) Press releases concerning the results or conclusions from the research under this contract shall not be made or otherwise distributed to the public without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.
                (d) Publication under the terms of this clause does not release the Contractor from the obligation of preparing and submitting to the Contracting Officer a final report containing the findings and results of research, as set forth in the schedule of the contract.
              
              (End of clause)

            Scope of part.
            This part sets out general Department of Commerce Acquisition Regulation (CAR) policies, including information regarding the maintenance and administration of the CAR, acquisition policies and practices, and procedures for deviation from the CAR and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This part describes the Commerce Acquisition Regulation in terms of establishment, relationship to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, arrangement, applicability, and deviation procedures.

              1301.101
              Purpose.
              The CAR establishes uniform acquisition policies and procedures that implement and supplement the FAR. If there is a discrepancy between the CAR and FAR, the FAR will take precedence.
            
            
              1301.103
              Authority.

              1301.104

              The CAR applies to all Department of Commerce (DOC) acquisitions as defined in part 2 of the FAR, except where expressly excluded.

              1301.105-1
              Publication and code arrangement.
              (a) The CAR is published in the Federal Register, in cumulative form in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and is available online at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Acquisition Management Web site.

              Arrangement of regulations.
              (a) General. The CAR is divided into the same parts, subparts, sections, and subsections as the FAR.
              (b) Numbering. If the DOC does not have supplemental regulations there will be no corresponding coverage in the CAR, and there will be gaps in the CAR numbering system.
            
            
              1301.105-3

              (a) The CAR parallels the FAR in format, arrangement and numbering system. Coverage within the CAR is identified by the prefix “13” or “130” followed by the complete FAR citation to the subsection level (e.g., CAR coverage of FAR 1.602-1 is cited as 1301.602-1).

              (b) Supplementary material without a FAR counterpart will be codified using 70 and up as appropriate for the part, subpart, section, or subsection number (e.g., part 1370, subpart 1301.70, section 1301.370 or subsection 1301.301-70).

              (a) Insert clause 1352.201-71, Ratification Release, in a contract document under which payment is made for unauthorized commitments after a ratification has been processed.
              (b)(1) Unauthorized commitments occur when the Department accepts goods or services in the absence of an enforceable contract entered into by an authorized official. It is the policy of DOC that all acquisitions are to be made only by Government officials having authority to make such acquisitions. Acquisitions made by other than authorized personnel are contrary to Departmental policy and the Department is not bound by any formal or informal type of agreement or contractual commitment which is made by persons who are not delegated contracting authority. Payment for goods or services accepted in the absence of an authorized commitment may be made only through the ratification process. Unauthorized commitments may be considered matters of serious misconduct and may subject the responsible employees to appropriate disciplinary actions.
              (2) The delegation of the ratification authority is set forth in CAM 1301.70. All requests for ratification must fully explain the circumstances that gave rise to the unauthorized commitment and detail, if appropriate, any disciplinary action taken with respect to any responsible employee. Ratifications may be approved only if all criteria in FAR 1.602-3 have been met.

              Policy.

              All procurement request packages submitted by program offices to initiate a procurement action for services shall contain a written determination by the designated requirements official that affirms that none of the functions to be performed in the statement of work are inherently governmental. This policy applies to all services other than personal services issued under statutory authority. If the contracting officer determines that there are substantial questions whether the work statement involves performance of inherently governmental functions, the contracting officer shall submit the matter for review by Procurement Counsel. Disagreements regarding the determination shall be resolved by the Head of Contracting Office (HCO) after consultation with counsel.

              Policy.
              (a) The designee authorized to establish qualification requirements is set forth in CAM 1301.70.
              (b) The designee authorized to waive the requirements of FAR 9.202 (a)(1)(ii) through (4) for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement is set forth in CAM 1301.70. This waiver authority does not apply to the qualification requirements contained in a qualified product list, qualified manufacturer list, or qualification bidders list.
              (c) The designee authorized to approve proceeding with a procurement, rather than delay the award in order to provide a potential offeror an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified in the qualifications, is set forth in CAM 1301.70.

              (a) Contracting officers shall review the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) listing for contractors after the opening of bids or receipt of proposals and, again, immediately prior to award.
              (b) The designee authorized to determine that a compelling reason exists to do business with a debarred/suspended contractor is set forth in CAM 1301.70. This designation does not apply to FAR 23.506(e).

              (b) A written determination must be issued by the designee authorized in CAM 1301.70 before the following actions can be taken with a contractor that is debarred, suspended or proposed for debarment:
              (1) Place any orders exceeding the maximum on an indefinite delivery contract;
              (2) Place orders under Federal supply schedule contracts, blanket purchase orders or basic ordering agreements; or
              (3) Add new work or exercise options that extend the duration of a current contract or order.

              1309.406-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. DOC employees shall immediately refer any cause that might serve as the basis for debarment through the contracting officer to the debarring official.
              (b) Decision-making process. (1) Procedures shall afford the contractor, and any named affiliates, an opportunity to submit information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment. This may be done in person, in writing or through a representative.
              (2) In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, where the contractor's submission raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, the following procedures will be followed:
              (i) Provide the contractor an opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and confront any person the agency presents;
              (ii) A transcribed record of the proceeding will be made, unless the agency and contractor mutually agree to waive the requirement for a transcript. This transcribed record is available to the contractor at cost.
              (c) Notice of proposal to debar. A notice of proposed debarment shall be issued by the debarring official in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c)(1) through (7).
              (d) Debarring official's decision. (1) For actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or when there is no authentic dispute over material facts, the debarring official's decision shall be based on all of the information in the administrative record plus any contractor-submitted data. If there is no suspension in effect, the decision shall be rendered within 30 working days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the contractor. The debarring official can extend this timeframe for good cause.

              (2)(i) When necessary, written findings of fact shall be prepared as to disputed material facts. The debarring official will utilize the information in the written findings of fact, the data submitted by the contractor plus any other information in the administrative record to develop the decision.
              (ii) While the debarring official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact, the debarring official can disregard any such findings in whole or in part upon a determination that they are clearly erroneous.
              (iii) After the conclusion of proceedings with respect to disputed facts, the debarring official will make a decision.
              (3) When the proposed debarment is not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the reason for debarment must be based on a preponderance of the evidence.
              (e) Notice of debarring official's decision. FAR 9.406-3(e)(1) establishes the notification procedures when a debarment has been imposed, while FAR 9.406-3(e)(2) establishes the procedure when a debarment is not imposed.
              (f) Procurement counsel shall assist and advise the debarring official at each stage of the decision-making process.

              (b) Decision-making process. (1) Procedures shall afford the contractor, and any named affiliates, an opportunity to submit information and argument in opposition to the proposed suspension. This may be done in person, in writing or through a representative.
              (2) In actions not based upon an indictment, where the contractor's submission raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed suspension and if no determination has been made, on the basis of Department of Justice advice, that substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced, the following procedures will be followed:
              (i) Provide the contractor an opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and confront any person the agency presents;
              (ii) A transcribed record of the proceeding will be made, unless the agency and contractor mutually agree to waive the requirement for a transcript. This transcribed record is available to the contractor at cost.
              (c) Notice of suspension. A notice of suspension shall be issued by the suspending official in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c)(1) through (6).
              (d) Suspending official's decision. (1) For actions based upon an indictment, when there is no authentic dispute over material facts, in which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of Department of Justice advice, the suspending official's decision shall be based on all of the information in the administrative record plus any contractor-submitted data.
              (2)(i) When necessary, written findings of fact shall be prepared as to the disputed material facts. The suspending official will utilize the information in the written findings of fact, the data submitted by the contractor plus any other information in the administrative record to develop the decision.
              (ii) While the suspending official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact, the suspending official can disregard any such findings in whole or in part upon a determination that they are clearly erroneous.
              (iii) After the conclusion of proceedings with respect to disputed facts, the suspending official will make a decision.

              (3) The suspension may be modified or terminated by the suspending official. However such a decision shall be without prejudice to the subsequent imposition of:
              
              (i) Suspension by any other agency; or
              (ii) Debarment by any agency.
              (4) The suspending official's decision shall be sent to the contractor and any affiliates involved, in writing, by certified mail, return receipt requested.
              (e) Procurement counsel shall assist and advise the suspending official at each stage of the decision-making process.

              Waiver.
              (a) The need for a waiver of an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may be identified by the contracting officer or by a written request submitted by an offeror or contractor. The contracting officer shall review all of the relevant facts and shall refer the matter to the Senior Bureau Procurement Official, who shall make a written recommendation to the Head of Contracting Activity whether a waiver should be granted to allow for a contract award or for continuation of an existing contract.
              (b) Criteria for Waiver of OCIs. Issuance of a waiver shall be limited to those situations in which:
              (1) The work to be performed under contract is vital to the agency;
              (2) There is no party other than the conflicted party that can perform the contract at issue; and

              General.
              DOC will accept for review and consideration unsolicited proposals from any entity. DOC will not pay any costs associated with the preparation of unsolicited proposals.

              (a) Unsolicited proposals are to be submitted to the appropriate DOC contracting office. Any person or entity considering the submission of an unsolicited proposal should first determine, based on the subject matter of the proposal, to which DOC operating unit the proposal applies. Proposers should contact the applicable operating unit contracting office to determine procedures for submission and to whom to send the proposal.
              (b) Program offices must immediately transmit any unsolicited proposals sent to them to their contracting office. If there is a question concerning which operating unit should evaluate an unsolicited proposal, the contracting office shall identify the proper office, in coordination with the Office of Acquisition Management, if necessary, and transmit the proposal to the applicable contracting office.

              (a) The operating unit contracting office is designated as the point of contact for receipt of unsolicited proposals. Persons within DOC (e.g. technical personnel) who receive unsolicited proposals shall forward all documents to their cognizant contracting office.
              (b) Within ten working days after receipt by the contracting office of an unsolicited proposal, the contracting office shall review the proposal and determine whether the proposal meets the content and marking requirements of FAR 15.6. If the proposal does not meet these requirements, it shall be returned to the submitter, giving the reasons for noncompliance.
            
            
              1315.606-2
              Evaluation.
              (a) If the contracting officer determines, upon initial review, that the unsolicited proposal meets all criteria in FAR 15.606-1, the contracting officer will acknowledge receipt of the proposal, coordinate evaluation with the program office, and provide to the submitter an estimated date that evaluation of the proposal is expected to be completed. The contracting officer shall transmit the proposal to the program office for evaluation, marking it in accord with FAR 15.609(d). If the estimated date for completion of the evaluation cannot be met, the submitter should be informed in a timely manner and provided with a revised evaluation completion date.

              (b) The evaluating office shall not reproduce or disseminate the proposal to other offices without the consent of the contracting officer. If the evaluating office requires additional information from the proposer, the evaluator shall request the information through the contracting officer, who will contact the proposer. The evaluator shall not communicate directly with the proposer.
              (c) Evaluators shall notify the contracting officer of their recommendations when the evaluation is complete. Following evaluation, the contracting officer shall proceed in accord with FAR 15.607.

              Emergency acquisition flexibilities.
              (a) Authorizing emergency acquisition flexibilities. The process for authorizing the use of emergency procurement flexibilities within the Department of Commerce may vary depending on the nature and type of the emergency situation. However, generally, if a Senior Bureau Procurement Official (BPO) determines that emergency acquisition flexibilities are required to meet contracting needs during an emergency situation, the BPO must obtain the Senior Procurement Executive's concurrence. In the event that increased warrant authority is needed, the BPO should contact the Senior Procurement Executive.
              (b) Continuity of Operations Plan. Each Contracting Activity shall have an updated Continuity of Operations Plan, in place designating emergency personnel with warrant levels.
              (c) Management controls. Senior BPOs must take affirmative steps to ensure that emergency flexibilities are used solely for requirements that have a clear and direct relationship to the emergency situation, and that appropriate management controls are established and maintained to support the use of the increased thresholds. The Office of Acquisition Management will conduct periodic reviews of transactions made pursuant to the expanded authorities to evaluate whether the transactions:
              (1) Were in support of the emergency situation;
              (2) Were made by an authorized individual;
              
              (3) Were appropriately documented; and
              (4) Provided the maximum practicable opportunity for small business participation.

              1334.201-70
              Policy.
              (a) In accordance with the Department's Information Technology Investment Performance Measurement and Performance Reporting Policy, the use of an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) is required for major acquisitions for information technology development in which the development/modernization/enhancement costs are anticipated to equal or exceed $25 million over the life of the acquisition. The Chief Information Officer may require EVMS on other acquisitions if the project merits special attention due to sensitivity, mission criticality, or risk potential.
              (b) If a project manager considers the use of an EVMS to be necessary for a major acquisition that does not meet the $25 million threshold, the project manager should conduct a cost/benefit analysis and consult with the OCIO on the advisability of requiring an EVMS.
              (c) Project managers, contracting officers, and contracting officer representatives responsible for major acquisitions requiring an EVMS must successfully complete an Earned Value Management course that meets the requirements of the OCIO.
              (d) The use of firm-fixed-price type contracts, subcontracts and other agreements are generally not suited to developmental efforts and the use of an EVMS is of limited utility under such arrangements. In the rare cases where a fixed-price type contract is contemplated for a developmental effort, the project manager and contracting officer must consult with the OCIO for guidance to determine whether an EVMS will be required.
              (e) The use of an EVMS is generally discouraged for contracts, subcontracts, and other agreements where the period of performance is less than 12 months in duration. Additionally, application of an EVMS to work efforts that are not discrete in nature should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
              (f) In cases where the nature of the work does not lend itself to the meaningful use of an EVMS, the OCIO may waive the EVMS requirement if appropriate.
            
            
              1334.202
              Integrated baseline reviews.
              An Integrated Baseline Review shall be conducted when an Earned Value Management System is required.

            Definitions.
            
              Human subject means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains:
            (1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or
            (2) Identifiable private information.
            
              Intervention includes both physical procedures by which data are gathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. Interaction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject. “Private information” includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record). Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research involving human subjects.
            
              Research means a systematic investigation, including research, development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Activities which meet this definition constitute research for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program which is considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities.

            (b) Insert clause 1352.235-71, Protection of Human Subjects—Exemption, in all contracts where the agency has determined based on documentation submitted by the offeror in response to provision 1352.235-70, Protection of Human Subjects, that the research involving human subjects is exempt from the requirements of 15 CFR part 27 and does not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. The provision is mandatory where an appropriate agency official has determined that the research involving human subjects to be carried out in performance of the award is exempt from 15 CFR part 27, and may not be modified without consultation with Program Counsel.
            (c) Insert clause 1352.235-72, Protection of Human Subjects—Institutional Approval, in all contracts where the agency has determined based on documentation submitted by the offeror in response to provision 1352.235-70, Protection of Human Subjects, that the research involving human subjects is not exempt from the requirements of 15 CFR part 27 and requires review by a cognizant Institutional Review Board (IRB). The provision is mandatory where an appropriate Agency official has determined that the research involving human subjects to be carried out in performance of the award is not exempt from 15 CFR part 27 and requires review by a cognizant IRB, and may not be modified without consultation with Program Counsel.
            (d) Insert clause 1352.235-73, Protection of Human Subjects—After Initial Contract Award, in all contracts where at the time of award no research involving human subjects is anticipated, but where decisions made in the course of the research may necessitate the addition of research involving human subjects to the work performed. The provision is mandatory where it is possible that the use of human subjects may be required in performance of the award but is not anticipated at the time of award, and may not be modified without consultation with Program Counsel.

                Restrictions on Printing and Duplicating (APR 2010)
                (a) The contractor is authorized to duplicate or copy production units provided the requirement does not exceed 5,000 production units of any one page or 25,000 production units in the aggregate of multiple pages. Such pages may not exceed a maximum image size of 103/4 by 141/4 inches. A “production unit” is one sheet, size 81/2 × 11 inches (215 × 280 mm), one side only, and one color ink.

Requests will be processed by the Contracting Officer in accordance with FAR 8.802.
                (d) The contractor shall include in each subcontract which may involve a requirement for any printing, duplicating, and copying in excess of the limits specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, a provision substantially the same as this clause, including this paragraph (d).

                Potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)

                (a) There is a potential organizational conflict of interest (see FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest) due to [state the nature of the potential conflict]. Accordingly:
                (1) Restrictions are needed to ensure that (state the nature of the proposed restraint and the applicable time period).
                (2) As a part of the proposal, the offeror shall provide the Contracting Officer with complete information regarding previous or ongoing work that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition.
                (b) If award is made to the offeror, the resulting contract may include an organizational conflict of interest limitation applicable to subsequent Government work, at either a prime contract level, at any subcontract tier, or both. During evaluation of proposals, the Government may, after discussions with the offeror and consideration of ways to avoid the conflict of interest, insert a provision in the resulting contract that shall disqualify the offeror from further consideration for award of specified future contracts.

                (c) The organizational conflict of interest clause included in this solicitation may be modified or deleted during negotiations.
                
                
                  Alternate I (Date). At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, substitute the following paragraph (b) for paragraphs (b) and (c) in the basic provision:

              Limitation of future contracting.
              As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507-2(a), insert the following clause:
              
                Limitation of Future Contracting (APR 2010)
                (a) The following restrictions and definitions apply to prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, or to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions.
                (1) Descriptions or definitions:
                (i) “Contractor” means the business entity receiving the award of this contract, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest.
                (ii) “Development” means all efforts towards solution of broadly defined problems. This may encompass research, evaluating technical feasibility, proof of design and test, or engineering of programs not yet approved for acquisition or operation.
                (iii) “Proprietary Information” means all information designated as proprietary in accordance with law and regulation, and held in confidence or disclosed under restriction to prevent uncontrolled distribution. Examples include limited or restricted data, trade secrets, sensitive financial information, and computer software; and may appear in cost and pricing data or involve classified information.
                (iv) “System” means the system that is the subject of this contract.
                (v) “System Life” means all phases of the system's development, production, or support.
                (vi) “Systems Engineering” means preparing specifications, identifying and resolving interface problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, and supervising design.
                (vii) “Technical Direction” means developing work statements, determining parameters, directing other contractors' operations, or resolving technical controversies.

                (2) Restrictions: The contractor shall perform systems engineering and/or technical direction, but will not have overall contractual responsibility for the system's development, integration, assembly and checkout, or production. The parties recognize that the contractor shall occupy a highly influential and responsible position in determining the system's basic concepts and supervising their execution by other contractors. The contractor's judgment and recommendations must be objective, impartial, and independent. To avoid the prospect of the contractor's judgment or recommendations being influenced by its own products or capabilities, it is agreed that the contractor is precluded for the life of the system from award of a DOC contract to supply the system or any of its major components, and from acting as a subcontractor or consultant to a DOC supplier for the system or any of its major components.
                
                
                  Alternate I (Date). As prescribed in CFR 1309.507-2(a)(2), either substitute paragraph (a)(2) of the basic clause with one or both of the following paragraphs, or use one or both in addition to the basic paragraph (a)(2).
                

                (a)(2)(i) The contractor shall prepare and submit complete specifications for nondevelopmental items to be used in a competitive acquisition. The contractor shall not furnish these items to DOC, either as a prime contractor or subcontractor, for the duration of the initial production contract plus [insert a specific period of time or an expiration date].

                (ii) The contractor shall either prepare or assist in preparing a work statement for use in competitively acquiring the [identify the system or services], or provide material leading directly, predictably, and without delay to such a work statement. The contractor may not supply [identify the services, the system, or the major components of the system] for a period [state the duration of the constraint, however, the duration of the initial production contract shall be the minimum], as either the prime or subcontractor unless it becomes the sole source, has participated in the design or development work, or more than one contractor has participated in preparing the work statement.
                
                
                  Alternate II (Date). As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507-2(a)(3), either substitute paragraph (a) (2) of the basic clause with the following paragraph, or add the following in addition to the basic restriction. Redesignate the paragraphs as needed if more than one restriction applies.

                (a)(2) The contractor shall participate in the technical evaluation of other contractors' proposals or products. To ensure objectivity, the contractor is precluded from award of any supply or service contract or subcontract for the system or its major components. This restriction shall be effective for (insert a definite period of time).

The contractor agrees to enter into company-to-company agreements to protect another company's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it is considered proprietary by the other company, and to refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. For information purposes, the contractor shall furnish copies of these agreements to the Contracting Officer. These agreements are not intended to protect information which is available to the Government or to the contractor from other sources and information furnished voluntarily without restriction.
                
                
                  Alternate IV (Date). As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507-2(a)(5), add the following paragraph (b) to the basic clause substantially as written. If Alternate III is also used, designate this paragraph (c).

                (b) The contractor agrees to accept and to complete all issued task orders, and to not contract with Government prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors in such a way as to create an organizational conflict of interest.
                
                
                  Alternate V (Date). As prescribed in 48 CRF 1309.507-2(a)(6), add the following paragraph (b) to the basic clause. If more than one Alternate is used, redesignate this paragraph accordingly.

                (b) The contractor agrees to accept and to complete issued delivery orders, provided that no new organizational conflicts of interest are created by the acceptance of such orders. The Contracting Officer shall identify any and all organizational conflicts of interest in each order. The contractor shall not contract with Government prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors in such a way as to create an organizational conflict of interest.

                (b) The above restrictions shall be included in all subcontracts, teaming arrangements, and other agreements calling for performance of work which is subject to the organizational conflict of interest restrictions identified in this clause, unless excused in writing by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor also agrees not to publish or otherwise divulge such information, in whole or in part, in any manner or form, nor to authorize or permit others to do so, taking such reasonable measures as are necessary to restrict access to such information while in the contractor's possession, to those employees needing such information to perform the work described herein, i.e., on a “need to know” basis.

                Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)
                (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:
                (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and
                (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.
                (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as “contractor”) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.
                (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.
                (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
                (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms “contract,” “contractor,” and “Contracting Officer” shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
                (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
                
                (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

                Based upon the results of the integrated assessment of the technical and cost/price proposals, the Government may make an award to other than the lowest-priced offeror or the offeror with the highest technical score if the source selection official determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.
                (a) Technical Evaluation Factors.
                Factor 1—TECHNICAL APPROACH. The proposal will be evaluated on how the offeror intends to organize, staff and manage the contract and the means that will be used to accomplish the contract requirements. The degree to which the proposal demonstrates an understanding of the requirements will be evaluated, as well as the offeror's planned management of consultants and subcontractors, if applicable.
                Factor 2—EXPERIENCE. The offeror's background, experience, and qualifications will be assessed to determine the likelihood that that offeror can successfully perform the contract requirements and the degree of the risk of non-performance.
                Factor 3—KEY PERSONNEL. The education, experience, and accomplishments of key personnel will be evaluated to determine the degree to which they possess the qualifications to perform their proposed duties under the contract.
                Factor 4—PAST PERFORMANCE. The offeror's past performance on related contracts will be evaluated to determine, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, effective management of subcontractors, cost management, level of communication between the contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.
                The Government reserves the right to assess the past performance of proposed subcontractors.
                The Government will use its discretion to determine the sources of past performance information used in the evaluation, and the information may be obtained from references provided by the offeror, the agency's knowledge of contractor performance, other government agencies or commercial entities, or past performance databases.
                If an offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating; however, an offeror without a history of relevant experience may receive a lowered rating for the experience evaluation factor.
                (b) Cost/Price Evaluation.
                (1) The proposed prices/costs will be evaluated but not scored. The cost evaluation will determine whether the proposed costs are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed costs must be entirely compatible with the technical proposal.
                (2) The Government may use the results of cost/price realism analysis to adjust the offeror's proposal to a most probable cost to the Government. The analysis may include information from a government auditing agency, Government technical personnel, and other sources.

              1352.215-76
              Cost or pricing data.
              As prescribed in 48 CFR 1315.204-570(b)(4), insert the following provision:
              
                Cost or Pricing Data
                Additional Instructions for Preparation of Cost/Price Proposals
                (a) General. In addition to the information required by CAR 1352.215-70, the cost/price proposal must contain an explanation of the offeror's and proposed subcontractors' fully burdened rates, including direct salary rates, overhead rates, and profit; and information regarding other direct costs.
                (b) Specific Requirements. (1) Direct Salary Rates: The offeror shall list the categories of professional or technical personnel required to perform the Statement of Work. A brief definition of the education and experience requirements which qualify an employee for inclusion in a listed category should be provided. Further, if some proposed labor categories are classified by multiple grades within a given discipline (e.g., Architect I and II, or Senior and Junior Engineer), a brief explanation as to how they are differentiated shall be provided.

                (2) The offeror, and major subcontractors, should provide individual rates for key personnel. Designation of an individual as a key person is subject to agreement of the parties. Where no key personnel are listed, category average rates are appropriate. Rates should be provided by year for the life of the contract. If rates are escalated, the degree (percent) and methodology must be shown. Escalation increases should reflect recent experience or established personnel policy. Types of salary increases given—merit, cost of living, etc.—should be discussed.
                (3) Overhead Costs. Generally, the offeror's accounting system and estimating practices will determine the method used to allocate overhead costs. The offeror's established practices, if in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, will be accepted. Proposed overhead rates should represent the offeror's best estimate of the rates to be experienced during the contract period as projected by company budgets or by recent experience adjusted for factors which will influence trends. A narrative statement outlining the offeror's policies and practices for accumulating overhead costs and the method used to compute the proposed rate or rates is required. In the case of multi-branch firms, joint ventures or affiliates, it is expected that overhead costs applicable to the specific location(s) where work is to be performed will be proposed. Company-wide, joint venture, or affiliate rate averages may not be appropriate. The rates should be tailored to the work location(s).
                (4) Profit. (i) A fair and reasonable provision for profit cannot be made by simply applying a certain predetermined percentage to the total estimated cost. Rather, profit should be established as a percentage/dollar amount after considering such factors as:
                (A) Degree of risk;
                (B) Nature of the work to be performed;
                (C) Joint venture responsibilities;
                (D) Extent of offeror's investment;
                (E) Subcontracting of work; and
                (F) Other criteria discussed in FAR 15.404-4.
                (ii) Separate percentage rates for profit are also required for major subcontractors.
                (5) Markup. The offeror may request a markup on subcontract labor. If it does so, it should state the percentage and provide a justification for that figure.
                (6) Other Direct Costs. The offeror shall briefly describe the following:
                (i) Travel/Subsistence costs;
                (ii) Subcontractor costs; and
                (iii) How subcontracting costs were analyzed.
                (c) Audit Reports. If the offeror or any subcontractor has been audited by a Government agency within the last two years, or has approved indirect cost rates, provide a copy of the audit report, or, if not available, the name, address, and telephone number of the audit office. Similarly, information on any Government-approved indirect cost rates should be provided.

                (b) Subject to Availability of Funds [Insert paragraph (b) when the contract is issued subject to the availability of funds].
                “The amount of funding for this contract is $____ [insert amount being funded], which consists of $____ [insert amount of reimbursable costs funded] for reimbursable costs and $ ____ [insert amount of fixed fee funded] for Fixed/Incentive Fee. These costs shall be subject to the provisions of FAR 52.232-22, “Limitations of Funds.” ”
                (c) Allowable Costs.
                (1) Final annual indirect cost rate(s) and the appropriate base(s) shall be established in accordance with FAR Subpart 42.7, in effect for the period covered by the indirect cost rate proposal.
                (2) Until final annual indirect cost rates are established for any period, the Government shall reimburse the contractor at billing rates established by the Contracting Officer (or cognizant Federal agency official) or auditor in accordance with FAR 42.704, subject to adjustment when the final rates are established. The established billing rates are currently as follows:
                __________ [Insert billing rate]

                (a) In performance of the effort directed in this contract, the contractor shall provide the total of Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLH) as specified in Part I, Section B during the term specified in Section ____. DPLH is defined as actual work hours exclusive of vacation, holidays, sick leave, and other absences.
                (b) Only the DPLH categories indicated below shall be charged directly to the contract. It is estimated that the DPLH will be expended approximately as follows:

                (d) In the event that the contractor shall be required to provide less than 90% of the estimated DPLH, the fixed fee of the contract shall be equitably adjusted by unilateral modification to the contract. The fixed fee adjustment shall be based solely upon the difference between the DPLH actually provided and 90% of the estimated DPLH, calculated as follows:
                
                Adjusted Fixed Fee = (Actual DPLH/(.9 × Estimated DPLH)) × Specified Fixed Fee
                

                (e) In the event that the contractor shall be required to provide more than 110% of the estimated DPLH, the fixed fee of the Contract shall be equitably adjusted by unilateral modification to the Contract. The fixed fee adjustment shall be based solely upon the difference between the DPLH actually provided and 110% of the estimated DPLH, calculated as follows:
                
                Adjusted Fixed Fee = (Actual DPLH/(1.1 × Estimated DPLH)) × Specified Fixed Fee

                (a) The total amount of award fee available under this contract is assigned according to the following:
                [Insert appropriate information]
                (b) A Performance Evaluation Plan shall be unilaterally established by the Government as part of the contract and used for the determination of award fees.

Notification of such changes shall be provided to the contractor [insert number] calendar days prior to the start of the evaluation period to which the change will apply.
                (e) At the conclusion of each evaluation period, and in accordance with the performance evaluation plan, a determination of the amount of the award fee earned shall be made in writing to the contractor by the Government Fee Determination Official (FDO). The FDO's unilateral determination of the amount of award fee earned in any evaluation period or a determination that no fee was earned shall be conclusive.
                (f) The contractor may submit a self-evaluation of its performance in an evaluation period. The FDO shall consider the self-evaluation, as the FDO deems appropriate.

This reserve shall not exceed 15 percent of the total base fee and potential award fee.
                (c) In the event of contract termination for convenience, either in whole or in part, the amount of award fee available shall represent a prorated distribution associated with evaluation period activities or events as determined by the Government.
                (d) The Government will promptly make payment of any award fee upon submission by the contractor to the Contracting Officer's authorized representative of a public voucher or invoice in the amount of the total fee earned for the period evaluated.

The cognizant SBA district office is:
                
                
                
                
                [To be completed by the Contracting Officer at time of award]
                (b) The contracting activity is responsible for administering the contract and taking any action on behalf of the Government under the terms and conditions of the contract. However, the contracting activity shall give advance notice to the SBA before it issues a final notice terminating performance, either in whole or in part, under the contract. The contracting activity shall also coordinate with SBA prior to processing any novation agreement. The contracting activity may assign contract administration functions to a contract administration office.
                (c) The 8(a) contractor agrees:
                (1) To notify the Contracting Officer, simultaneously with its notification to SBA (as required by SBA's 8(a) regulations), when the owner or owners upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based plan to relinquish ownership or control of the concern. Consistent with 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(21), transfer of ownership or control shall result in termination of the contract for convenience, unless SBA waives the requirement prior to the actual relinquishing of ownership or control; and
                (2) To adhere to the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.

                Protection of Human Subjects (APR 2010)
                (a) Research involving human subjects is not permitted under this award unless expressly authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. Such authorization will specify the details of the approved research involving human subjects and will be incorporated by reference into this contract.
                (b) The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the “Common Rule”), adopted by the Department of Commerce at 15 CFR part 27, requires contractors to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for the protection of human subjects in research. The Common Rule defines a “human subject” as a living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. The term “research” means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. The Common Rule also sets forth categories of research that may be considered exempt from 15 CFR part 27. These categories may be found at 15 CFR 27.101(b).
                (c) In the event the human subjects research involves pregnant women, prisoners, or children, the contractor is also required to follow the guidelines set forth at 45 CFR part 46 subpart B, C and D, as appropriate, for the protection of members of a protected class.
                (d) Should research involving human subjects be included in the proposal, prior to issuance of an award, the contractor shall submit the following documentation to the Contracting Officer:
                (1) Documentation to verify that contractor has established a relationship with an appropriate Institutional Review Board (“cognizant IRB”). An appropriate IRB is one that is located within the United States and within the community in which the human subjects research will be conducted;

                (e) Prior to starting any research involving human subjects, the contractor shall submit appropriate documentation to the Contracting Officer for institutional review and approval. This documentation may include:
                (1) Copies of the human subjects research protocol, all questionnaires, surveys, advertisements, and informed consent forms approved by the cognizant IRB;
                (2) Documentation of approval for the human subjects research protocol, questionnaires, surveys, advertisements, and informed consent forms by the cognizant IRB;
                (3) Documentation of continuing IRB approval by the cognizant IRB at appropriate intervals as designated by the IRB, but not less than annually; and/or

                (4) Documentation to support an exemption for the project from the Common Rule [Note: this option is not available for activities that fall under 45 CFR part 46 subpart C].
                (f) In addition, if the contractor modifies a human subjects research protocol, questionnaire, survey, advertisement, or informed consent form approved by the cognizant IRB, the contractor shall submit a copy of all modified material along with documentation of approval for said modification by the cognizant IRB to the Contracting Officer for institutional review and approval. The contractor shall not implement any IRB approved-modification without written approval by the Contracting Officer.

                (g) No work involving human subjects may be undertaken, conducted, or costs incurred and/or charged to the project, until the Contracting Officer approves the required appropriate documentation in writing.

Therefore, if the contractor modifies a human subjects research protocol, advertisement, or informed consent form approved by the cognizant IRB, contractor shall submit a copy of all modified material, along with documentation of approval for said modification by the cognizant IRB, to the Contracting Officer for agency institutional review and approval. Contractor may not implement any IRB-approved modification without written approval by the Contracting Officer.
                Documentation of continuing IRB approval is required each year by the renewal date assigned by the cognizant IRB. Documentation of continuing IRB approval must be submitted to the Government for review and approval as soon as it occurs. Continuing approval of the human subjects research must be obtained from the cognizant IRB and provided to the Government until the research is completed or terminated. The contractor may proceed with previously approved human subjects research, if any, under this contract while the Government is conducting continuing review and approval of the human subjects research protocol. In the event that the Government determines, during the course of its review, that the human subjects research in this contract is not in compliance with the regulations set forth at 15 CFR part 27, or this contract, the Contracting Officer may take the appropriate enforcement action, including disallowing costs, suspending or terminating the human subjects protocol or the contract, by notifying the contractor in writing.
                (d) It is incumbent upon contractor to ensure that continuing IRB review approval occurs in accordance with 15 CFR part 27. In the event that continuing review approval does not occur as set forth by 15 CFR part 27, contractor is to notify the Contracting Officer immediately.

                (b) Offerors are encouraged to submit all questions in writing at least [__] days prior to the conference. Questions will be considered at any time prior to, or during, the conference; however, offerors will be asked to confirm verbal questions in writing.

              Inspection and manner of doing work.
              As prescribed in 48 CFR 1371.101, insert the following clause:
              
                Inspection and Manner of Doing Work (APR 2010)
                (a) All work and material shall be subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer or duly authorized representative. Work shall be performed in accordance with the plans and specifications of this contract as modified by any contract modification.
                (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided for in the contract, all operational practices of the contractor and all workmanship and material, equipment and articles used in the performance of work shall be in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping “Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels”, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F), U.S. Coast Guard Electrical Engineering Regulations (46 CFR Subchapter J), and U.S. Public Health Service “Handbook on Sanitation of Vessel Construction”, in effect at the time of the contract award; and the best commercial maritime practices, except where military specifications are specified, in which case such standards of material and workmanship shall be followed.

                (c) All material and workmanship shall be subject to inspection and test at all times during the contractor's performance of the work to determine their quality and suitability for the purpose intended and compliance with the contract. In case any material or workmanship furnished by the contractor is found to be defective prior to redelivery of the vessel, or not in accordance with the requirements of the contract, the Government shall have the right prior to redelivery of the vessel to reject such material or workmanship, and to require its correction or replacement by the contractor at the contractor's cost and expense. This Government right is in addition to its rights under any Guarantee clause in this contract. If the contractor fails to proceed promptly with the replacement or correction of such material or workmanship, as required by the Contracting Officer, the Government may, by contract or otherwise, replace or correct such material or workmanship and charge to the contractor the excess cost to the Government. The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the work specified in the contract. Records of all inspection work by the contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of two (2) years after delivery of the vessel to the Government.
                (d) No welding, including tack welding and brazing, shall be permitted in connection with repairs, completions, alterations, or addition to hulls, machinery or components of vessels unless the welder is, at the time, qualified to the standards established by the U.S. Coast Guard, the American Bureau of Shipping, or the Department of the Navy. The welder's qualifications shall be appropriate for the particular service application, filler material type, position of welding, and welding process involved in the work being undertaken. A welder may be required to re-qualify if the Contracting Officer believes there is a reasonable doubt concerning the welder's ability. Welders' qualifications for this purpose shall be governed by the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F). When a welding process other than manual shielded arc is proposed or required, the contractor or fabricator shall submit procedure qualification tests for approval prior to production welding. Procedure qualification tests shall be conducted in accordance with the United States Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F).
                (e) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care to protect the vessel from fire, and the contractor shall maintain a reasonable system of inspection over the activities of welders, burners, riveters, painters, plumbers and similar workers, particularly where such activities are undertaken in the vicinity of the vessel's fuel oil tanks, magazines or storerooms containing flammable material. A reasonable number of hose lines shall be maintained by the contractor ready for immediate use on the vessel at all times while the vessel is berthed alongside the contractor's pier or in dry dock or on a marine railway. All tanks or bilge areas under alteration or repair shall be cleaned, washed, and steamed out or otherwise made safe by the contractor if and to the extent necessary as required by good marine practice or by current Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) shall be furnished with a “gas free” or “safe for hot work” or “safe for workers” certificate before any hot work or entry is done. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contractor shall at all times maintain a reasonable fire watch about the vessel, including a fire watch on the vessel while work is being performed thereon.
                (f) The contractor shall place proper safeguards and/or effect such safety precautions as necessary, including suitable and sufficient lighting, for the prevention of accidents or injury to persons or property during the prosecution of work under this contract and/or from time of receipt of the vessel until acceptance by the Government of the work performed.
                (g) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, when the vessel is in the custody of the contractor or in dry dock or on a marine railway and the temperature becomes as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the contractor shall keep all pipelines, fixtures, traps, tanks, and other receptacles on the vessel drained to avoid damage from freezing, or if this is not practicable, the vessel shall be kept heated to prevent such damage. The vessel's stern tube and propeller hubs shall be protected from frost damage by applied heat through the use of a salamander or other proper means, as approved by the COR.
                (h) Whenever practicable, the work shall be performed in a manner which does not interfere with the berthing and messing of personnel attached to the vessel. The contractor shall ensure that assigned personnel have access to the vessel at all times. It is understood that such personnel will not interfere with the work or the contractor's workers.
                (i) The Government does not guarantee the correctness of the dimensions, sizes, and shapes shown in any sketches, drawings, plans or specifications prepared or furnished by the Government. Prior to submitting an offer, it is the responsibility of the bidder/offeror to verify the dimensions, sizes, and shapes in materials provided by the Government. Where practical, the Government will make the vessel available for inspection prior to bid opening or the date for receipt of proposals. If the contractor, as a result of inspection or otherwise, discovers any error in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications, it shall immediately inform the Contracting Officer of the error and proceed in accord with instructions received from the Contracting Officer. The Government is not liable for any claims or charges resulting from additional work performed by the contractor as a result of a patent ambiguity in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications that was not brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall be responsible for the correctness of the shape, sizes and dimensions of parts furnished by the contractor under the contract.
                (j) The contractor shall at all times keep the site of the work on the vessel free from accumulation of waste material or rubbish caused by contractor employees or the work, and at the completion of the work shall remove all rubbish from and about the site of the work and shall leave the work and its immediate vicinity “broom-clean” unless more exactly specified in this contract.

                (k) While in drydock or on a marine railway, the contractor shall be responsible for the closing, before the end of working hours, of all valves and openings upon which work is being done by its workers when such closing is practicable. The contractor shall establish a list and keep the COR cognizant of the closure status of all valves and openings upon which the contractor's workers have been working.
                (l) Without additional expense to the Government, the contractor shall employ specialty subcontractors where required by the specifications or when necessary for satisfactory performance of the work.
                (m)(1) Unless otherwise stated in the contract, the contractor shall notify the COR at least 72 hours in advance:
                (i) Prior to starting inspections or tests; and
                (ii) When supplies will be ready for Government inspection.
                (2) Such notification shall be provided either verbally or in writing at the discretion of the COR.

                Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)
                (a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.
                (b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include:

                (11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.
                (c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.
                (d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made.
                (e) Mail the original invoice to:

              Additional Item Requirements (AIR)—growth work
              As prescribed in 48 CFR 1371.103, insert the following clause:
              
                Additional Item Requirements (Air)—Growth Work (APR 2010)
                (a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes—Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.

                (b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule:
                (1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance.
                (2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance.
                (3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.
                (c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:
                (1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging.
                (2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).
                (d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.
                (e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.
                (f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals:
                (1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.
                (2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided.
                (3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer.
                (4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.
                (g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.

                Minimization of Delay Due to Government Furnished Property (APR 2010)

                (a) In order to assure timely performance under this contract, it is imperative that delay in the contract's performance period resulting from late, damaged, or unsuitable Government furnished property be held to an absolute minimum. In order to achieve minimization of delay, it is agreed that:
                (1) Subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Government shall deliver each item of Government furnished property to the contractor on or before the date specified in the contract or, if later, in sufficient time for the contractor to meet the contract performance period.
                (2) The Government may forego furnishing any item of Government property to the contractor. In that event, the contractor shall prepare the vessel in terms of piping, wiring, structure, foundation, ventilation, and any other pre-installation requirements of the item, so that the work on the vessel may continue without delay and disruption resulting from the absence of the item. If the Government does not furnish an item designated as Government furnished property, the contract price may be adjusted accordingly.
                (b) The delivery or performance dates for the supplies or services to be furnished by the contractor under this contract are based upon the expectation that Government furnished property suitable for use (except for such property furnished “as is”) will be delivered to the contractor at the time stated in the specification or, if not so stated, in sufficient time to enable the contractor to meet such delivery or performance dates. If the Government furnished property is not furnished in the time stated in the contract, or, if a date is not specified, and the late delivery does not give the contractor sufficient time to enable the contractor to meet required contract delivery or performance dates, the contractor shall notify the Government in writing of the late delivery. Notification shall include cost and schedule impacts, including delays and disruptions to schedules. This notification shall be submitted as soon as practical or known.
                (c) The provisions in subsection (b) of this clause and in FAR 52.245-1, if applicable, provide the exclusive remedies to the contractor resulting from delay in delivery of Government furnished property or delivery of such property in a condition not suitable for its intended use.

              Liability and insurance.
              As prescribed in 48 CFR 1371.110, insert the following clause:
              
                Liability and Insurance (APR 2010)
                (a) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care and use its best efforts to prevent accidents, injury or damage to all employees, persons and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part thereof upon which work is done.

                (b) The contractor shall be responsible for and make good at its own cost and expense any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever nature to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo, and Government-owned material and equipment for the repair, completion, alteration of or addition to the vessel in the possession of the contractor, whether at the plant or elsewhere, arising or growing out of the performance of the work, except where the contractor can affirmatively show that such loss or damage was due to causes beyond the contractor's control, was proximately caused by the fault or negligence of agents or employees of the Government, or which loss or damage the contractor by exercise of reasonable care was unable to prevent. However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor. To induce the contractor to perform the work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and Government-owned materials and equipment, shall in no event exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00. As to the contractor, the Government assumes the risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned materials and equipment in excess of $1,000,000.00. This assumption of risk includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of whatsoever degree of the contractor's servants, employees, agents or subcontractors, but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of contractor's personnel, who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the contractor's business, or all or substantially all of the contractor's operation at any one plant. However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action against third persons which exists in favor of the contractor, and the contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in any person except the contractor, nor shall any person (except the contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendant in any action against the contractor brought to determine the contractor's liability, or for any other purpose.
                (c) The contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and the vessel against all suits, actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of anyone other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel, or the vessel, arising or resulting in whole or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or employees; provided that the contractor's obligation to indemnify under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel. Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. Any new equipment warranties that extend beyond the 90 days after redelivery of the vessel shall be assigned to the Government upon redelivery of the vessel. With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the Government and the contractor shall be as determined by other provisions of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury received during the period covered by the contractor's indemnity as provided herein.
                (d) The contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this clause. In addition, the contractor shall at its own expense procure and thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as may be necessary to insure the contractor against its liability as ship repairer in the amount of $1,000,000.00, or the value of the vessel as determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, however, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the contractor shall procure and maintain in force Worker's Compensation Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work and shall ensure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by all subcontractors engaged in the work. The contractor shall provide evidence of insurance as required by the Government.
                (e) The contractor shall receive no allowance in the contract price for inclusion of any premium expense or charge for any reserve made on account of self-insurance for coverage against any risk assumed by the Government under this clause.
                (f) As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or damage, the risk of which the Government has assumed, written notice of the damage shall be given by the contractor to the Contracting Officer. The notice shall contain full particulars of the loss or damage. If claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the contractor as the result or because of such event, the contractor shall immediately deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process received by it or its representatives. The contractor shall cooperate with the Government, and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the attendance of witnesses, and other assistance required in the conduct of suits. The Government shall pay to the contractor the expense, other than the cost of maintaining the contractor's usual organization, incurred in this assistance. Except at its own cost, the contractor shall not voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense not imperative for the protection of the vessel or vessels at the time of the event.

                Documentation of Requests for Equitable Adjustment (APR 2010)
                (a) For the purpose of this clause, the term “change” includes not only a change made pursuant to a written order designated as a “change order,” but also any act or omission to act on the part of the Government where a request is made for equitable adjustment.
                (b) Whenever the contractor requests or proposes an equitable adjustment to the contract price for a change or an act or omission on the part of the Government, the request shall include a breakdown of the price adjustment in such form and supported by such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may request. As a minimum, the contractor shall provide a breakdown of direct labor hours, labor dollars, overhead, material, subcontracts, contingencies and profit for each change and a justification for any extension of the delivery date.
                (c) Whenever the contractor requests or proposes an equitable adjustment of $100,000 or greater gross (aggregate increases and/or decreases) for a change made pursuant to a written order designated as a “change order,” or whenever the contractor requests an equitable adjustment in any amount for any other act or omission to act on the part of the Government, the proposal supporting such request shall contain the following information for each individual item or element of the request:
                (1) A description of the unperformed work required by the contract before the change which has been deleted by the change and the work deleted by the change that already has been completed in whole or in part. The description shall include a list of components, equipment, and other identifiable property involved. Also, the status of manufacture, procurement, or installation of such property shall be indicated. A separate description shall be furnished for design and production work. Items of raw material, purchased parts, components, and other identifiable hardware which are made excess by the change, and which are not to be retained by the contractor, are to be listed for later disposition;
                (2) A description of the work necessary to undo work already completed which has been deleted by the change;
                (3) A description of the work substituted or added by the change that was not required by the terms of the contract before the change. A list of components and equipment (not bulk material or items) involved should be included. A separate description shall be furnished for design work and production work;
                (4) A description of any interference or inefficiency encountered in performing the change;
                (5) A description of disruption attributable solely to the change, which shall include the following information:
                (i) A specific description of each element of disruption which states how the work has been, or will be, disrupted;
                (ii) The calendar time period when disruption occurred, or will occur, illustrated via critical path analysis;
                (iii) The area(s) aboard ship where disruption occurred, or will occur;
                (iv) The trade(s) disrupted, with a breakdown of man-hours for each trade;
                (v) The scheduling of trades before, during, and after the period of disruption;
                (vi) A description of measures taken to lessen the disruptive effect of the change.
                (6) The delay in delivery attributable solely to the change;
                (7) A description of other work attributed to the change;
                (8) A narrative statement of the direct causal relationship between any alleged Government act or omission and the claimed result, cross-referenced to the detailed information required above; and
                (9) A statement setting forth a comparative enumeration of the amounts “budgeted” for the cost elements, including the materials cost, labor hours, and indirect costs pertinent to the change estimated by the contractor in preparing its proposal(s) for this contract, and the amounts claimed to have been incurred, or projected to be incurred, corresponding to each such “budgeted cost” element.
                (10) At the time of agreement upon the price of the equitable adjustment, the contractor shall submit a signed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data.
                (d) Pending execution of a bilateral agreement or the direction of the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes clause, the contractor shall proceed diligently with contract performance without regard to the effect of any such proposed change.

                Lay Days (APR 2010)

                (a) A lay day is defined as an additional day on dry dock or marine railway caused by a Government-issued change. Reimbursement for lay days shall be paid at the rate stated in the Schedule.
                
                (b) No amount for lay day time shall be paid until all contract line items (including optional items) that require drydocking of the vessel have been completed. Lay days for work ordered pursuant to the Additional Item Requirements Clause shall not be compensable unless all dry dock work included in the contract line items is complete.
                (c) Days of hauling out and floating, whatever the hour, shall not be paid as lay day time, and days when no work is performed by the contractor shall not be paid as lay day time. Days in which work is performed that are considered normal “non-work” days (weekends or holidays) shall not be paid as lay day time if the ship would have otherwise been in dry dock.
                (d) Payment of lay day time shall constitute complete compensation for all costs associated with lay days except for costs directly related to the changed work.

                Changes—Ship Repair (APR 2010)
                (a) The Contracting Officer may, at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract, in any one or more of the following:
                (1) Drawings, designs, or specifications, when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Government in accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications;
                (2) Method of shipment or packing;
                (3) Place of performance of the work;
                (4) Time of commencement or completion of the work; and
                (5) Other requirements within the general scope of the contract.
                (b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether changed or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract accordingly.
                (c) The contractor must submit any proposal for adjustment under this clause within 5 days from the date of receipt of the written order. At the Contracting Officer's discretion, the 5-day period may be shortened. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract.
                (d) If the contractor's proposal includes the cost of property rendered obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.
                (e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.

                Guarantees (APR 2010)
                (a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within __ days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.
                (b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the __day period until its expiration.
                (c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item.
                (d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.
                (1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.
                (2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.

                (e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional __ day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.
                
                (f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
                (g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.

Temporary services may include the furnishing of water, electricity, telephone service, toilet facilities, garbage removal, office space, parking places or similar facilities.

                (b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a certificate or certificates executed by an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each certificate shall state that (name of insurer) has insured (name of contractor) awarded contract number ______ for repair/alteration of (name of vessel) in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance Requirements clause contained herein. Each certificate shall set forth that each policy of insurance represented thereby will expire on (APR 2010) and that each such policy contains the following clause:

              Agency regulations.

              (a) Policy. DOI regulations governing the conduct and responsibilities of regular and special employees are contained in 43 CFR part 20. Additional guidance is contained in the DOI publication “Ethics Guide for Department of the Interior Employees.” Copies of the Guide can be obtained from the Bureau/Office Ethics Office or on the Internet at http://www.doi.gov/ethics/. With regard to the provisions of 43 CFR part 20, officials who participate personally and substantially in DOI procurements (as defined in FAR 3.104-3), may not solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or anything of monetary value from a competing contractor during the conduct of a procurement.

              (b)(1) Officials may not accept or solicit from any competing contractor any services that involve the development of specifications, statements of work, evaluation criteria, or formal cost estimates to be used in a procurement unless such services are formally contracted for pursuant to the FAR and DIAR, and until the organizational COI provisions in FAR Subpart 9.5 have been fully addressed. This does not preclude COs from issuing formal Requests for Comment (RFC) or draft RFPs.
              (2) IT resources shall not be accepted, installed or utilized by the Department on a no cost, free of charge basis (this includes donated equipment but not public domain software), except as permitted by law.
            
            
              1403.101-70
              Technical evaluators and advisors.
              (a) Technical evaluators and advisors, including members of proposal evaluation committees, must render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance and advice.
              (b) With the exception of contracting personnel, proposal evaluators and advisors are not required to file a Confidential Financial Disclosure Report (SF450) unless they occupy positions identified in 43 CFR 20.735.30(b). Therefore, when an individual is appointed as an evaluator or advisor, he/she must sign and return to the CO a Conflict of Interest Certificate in a format approved by the HCA. If a potential COI exists, the appointee must not be allowed to evaluate or advise on an offeror's proposal until the conflict has been resolved with the servicing Ethics Counselor.
              (c) During the evaluation process, each evaluator and advisor is responsible for ensuring that there are no financial or employment interests that conflict or give the appearance of conflicting with his or her duty to evaluate proposals impartially and objectively. Examples of situations that may be prohibited or represent a potential COI include:
              (1) Financial interest, including stocks and bonds, in a firm that submits, or is expected to submit, an offer in response to the solicitation;
              (2) Outstanding financial commitments to any actual or potential offeror;
              (3) Employment in any capacity, even if otherwise permissible, by any actual or potential offeror;
              (4) Employment within the last 12 months by an actual or potential offeror;
              (5) Any non-vested pension or re-employment rights, or interest in profit sharing or stock bonus plans arising out of past employment by an actual or potential offeror; or
              (6) Employment of any member of the immediate family by an actual or potential offeror.

              (d) Bureaus shall include a notice similar to the following in all correspondence notifying employees of appointments to serve as technical evaluators or advisors, formally called Technical Evaluation Panels (TEP) and/or Source Evaluation Boards (SEB):
              
              
                You shall not solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary value from a competing contractor involved in any action for which you participate personally and substantially under this delegation of authority. You are also reminded of other conduct prohibitions in FAR 3.104-3, including negotiating with competing contractors for future employment, disclosure of contractor bid or proposal information or source selection information, and post-Government employment restrictions.
                Such notice shall include an acknowledgement of receipt signed and returned by the employee.

              1403.104-7
              Violations or possible violations.
              (a)(1) The CO's determination that there is no impact on the procurement due to a possible violation of the Procurement Integrity Act and decision to proceed with contract award shall receive concurrence from an individual one level above the CO.
              (2) In case of nonconcurrence with the CO's determination, the HCA shall provide a copy of the reported violation and recommended action to the OIG in accordance with Part 111 DM 3. The CO, in consultation with the SOL and the OIG, must justify the compelling circumstances for immediate award and obtain approval to proceed from the BPC without the power of redelegation. Copies of the determination to proceed with the award will be sent to the Director, PAM, for submission to the AS/PMB.
            
          
          
            Subpart 1403.2—Contractor Gratuities to Government Personnel
            
              1403.203
              Reporting suspected violations of the Gratuities clause.
              When suspected violations of the clause at FAR 52.203-3, Gratuities, become known to a Federal Government employee, the matter shall be reported, in writing, to the cognizant CO or the CO's supervisor, as appropriate. The report shall clearly state the alleged circumstances surrounding the incident or incidents in which the contractor offered or gave a gratuity to a Federal Government employee and intended to obtain a contract or favorable treatment under a contract because of the gratuity. The date(s), location(s) and name(s) of all parties involved in the incident shall be included in the report.
            
            
              1403.204
              Treatment of violations.

              (a) The CO will provide the contractor with a formal notice that summarizes the events involving the suspected violation and affords the contractor the opportunity to take the action(s) listed under FAR 3.204(b). The notice shall contain a time limit for reply and shall be sent by certified mail return receipt requested. The CO will submit the report, additional documentary evidence and other pertinent information to the HCA for disposition with a recommended course of action. A copy of this submission must also be sent to the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations. In consultation with the SOL and the OIG, and based on the results of any further discussion with the contractor, its counsel or witnesses, the HCA may make a recommendation to the Director, PAM, pursuant to FAR 3.204(c) and shall provide formal notice to the contractor of such recommendation.
              (b) If the decision involves the termination of a contract (see FAR 3.204(c)(1)), the CO will be responsible for implementing the decision.
            
          
          
            Subpart 1403.3—Reports of Suspected Antitrust Violations
            
              1403.303
              Reporting suspected antitrust violations.
              (a) Reports on suspected violations of antitrust laws as required by FAR 3.303 shall be prepared by the CO, reviewed by the SOL, and submitted by the HCA directly to the Attorney General, Department of Justice. A copy of this submission must also be sent to the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations.
              (b) Depending on the nature of the suspected violation or the disposition of the matter, the HCA may recommend debarment or suspension in accordance with FAR 9.406-2(a)(2) or 9.407-2(a)(2) and subpart 1409.4.

              1403.570-1
              Policy.
              Award of a contract does not signify endorsement of the supplies or services purchased, nor does it signify agreement with any views espoused by officials of the awardee. It is vital to the integrity of the procurement system to avoid even the appearance of an improper preference toward a particular vendor. Therefore, contractors shall not be permitted to publicize, or otherwise circulate, promotional materials that state or imply Governmental endorsement of a product, service or position which the contractor represents.
            
            
              1403.570-2
              Procedures.
              If a contractor requests a determination as to the propriety of such promotional material, the response shall be coordinated with the cognizant Public Affairs Office and Ethics Officer.
            
            
              1403.570-3
              Contract clause.
              CO's shall include the clause at 1452.203-70, Restriction on Endorsements, in all solicitations, contracts and agreements which are not executed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 or 13.
            
          
          
            Subpart 1403.6—Contracts With Government Employees or Organizations Owned or Controlled by Them
            
              1403.602
              Exceptions.
              The HCA, without the power of redelegation, is authorized to except a contract from the policy in FAR 3.601. However, no exceptions may be granted where the proposed contractor is owned or controlled by a Government employee or one or more members of the employee's immediate family and the employee or any subordinate is serving as a procurement official on the proposed contract.
            
            
              1403.603
              Responsibilities of the contracting officer.

              The CO shall prepare a written determination and findings for the signature of the HCA when requesting authorization to allow a contract award to a Government employee or business concern or other organization owned or substantially owned or controlled by one or more Government employees.
            
          
          
            Subpart 1403.7—Voiding and Rescinding Contracts
            
              1403.704
              Policy.
              The HCA is authorized to declare void and rescind contracts in accordance with the procedures in FAR 3.705.
            
            
              1403.705
              Procedures.
              (a) Reporting.

              (2) Accompany the requisition;
              (3) Contain the information required by FAR 6.303-2; and
              (4) Request the CO to conduct a market survey by issuing a synopsis of the proposed contract action (see 1405.207). The initiating office shall evaluate and document all responses to the notice. The CO shall prepare the D&F that only one source can meet the Government's needs based on the evaluation results. The evaluation results shall be included in the justification as required by FAR 6.303-2(a)(8) if it is determined that only one source can meet the Government's needs.

              (b) The procedure in paragraph (a) of this section is not required for proposed contract actions to be awarded under the authority in FAR 6.302-2 when the CO determines that preparation and approval of the justification would unreasonably delay the acquisition. Under these circumstances, a justification may be prepared and approved after award in accordance with FAR 6.303-1(d).

              Policy.
              (a) Duplicating is the mass reproduction of materials beyond the capabilities of typical office copiers. Volumes are of sufficient mass quantities up to 5,000 single-page and 25,000 production units in the aggregate of multiple pages. Such duplicating units shall require Departmental approval to be processed through the Department of the Interior Publishing Council (DOIPC).
              (b) Copying is distinguished from “duplicating” in that such work is administrative in nature, produced on office copying equipment and produced as necessary, in limited quantities. Volumes typically range from 1 to 500 single-pages to 2,500 production units in the aggregate of multiple pages. This volume standard is referred to as the “500/2500” rule. Reproduction work exceeding the “500/2500” rule is duplicating, and requires a waiver from the nearest servicing GPO office. Employees should consult with their bureau printing officer or the DOIPC representative to secure such a waiver.
              (c) The DOIPC has been designated as the Department's liaison with the Joint Committee on Printing and GPO. Requirements for printing and related supplies shall be coordinated with the DOIPC or the designated bureau publications liaison officer in accordance with 314 DM 1.

              As used in this subpart:
              
                Case Representative refers to the individual who prepares and forwards the action referral memorandum to the Debarring and Suspending Official and provides additional assistance in the course of action resolution. Debarment and Suspension actions may be referred to the Debarring and Suspending Official for consideration from different sources, as appropriate. The HCA, or designee, may refer matters.

              (a) A judgment or any other determination of guilt of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or plea, including a plea of nolo contendere; or,
              (b) Any other resolution that is the functional equivalent of a judgment, including probation before judgment and deferred prosecution. A disposition without the participation of the court is the functional equivalent of a judgment only if it includes an admission of guilt.
              
                Debarring Official refers to the Director, PAM. The Debarring Official is the official authorized to impose debarment or suspension. The Debarring Official also may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if it is in the best interest of the Government.
              
                Suspending Official refers to the Director, PAM.

              General.
              The Director, PAM, is authorized to make the statement regarding debarment by another agency's debarring official under the conditions in FAR 9.406-1(c).
            
            
              1409.406-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. Whenever a cause for debarment, as listed in FAR 9.406-2. becomes known to a DOI employee, the matter shall be referred by the case representative to the Debarring Official, in consultation, as appropriate, with the HCA involved, the SOL, and OIG. The case representative will review the matter and, as warranted, prepare and submit to the Debarring Official for consideration an Action Referral Memorandum (ARM) with supporting documentation.
              (b) Notice of Proposed Debarment. Based upon review of the ARM, as appropriate, the Debarring Official shall initiate proposed debarment by taking the actions listed in FAR 9.406-3(c) and advising the contractor of DOI's process for contesting the action.
              (c) Decision-making process. (1) For debarment actions based upon a conviction, civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, consistent with FAR 9.406-3(d)(1), the Debarring Official shall make a decision on the basis of the information in the administrative record, including any contractor submissions. Where the proceeding includes an oral presentation of matters in opposition (PMIO) to the Debarring Official, the PMIO will be conducted in an informal business meeting format and tape recorded for the administrative record.
              (2) For actions listed under FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), upon concluding from a contractor's information in response to the action notice that facts material to the existence of cause for debarment are genuinely in dispute, the Debarring Official may refer the disputed material facts to another official for fact-finding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Debarment Program fact-finding procedures.
              (i) The fact-finding proceeding will be transcribed. The fact-finding official will file the original copy of the transcript with the case record. The reporter's fees and other direct costs associated with the hearing shall be borne by the bureau or office initiating the debarment action, except in the case of actions initiated by the OIG. For actions initiated by the OIG, the costs will be borne by the bureau(s) and/or office(s) out of which the matter arose. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to the contractor as provided under FAR 9.406-3(b)(2)(ii).
              (ii) Subject to the provisions of 43 CFR part 1, the contractor, and any specifically named affiliate, may be represented by counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in such a manner that each party will have a full opportunity to present all information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to the contractor under the condition in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2)(ii).

              (iii) The fact-finding official will prepare findings of fact, certify the entire hearing record and provide said findings and record to the Debarring Official. The fact-finding official shall not make any recommendations unless the Debarring Official has expressly requested such recommendations in writing. Following receipt of the findings of fact, the Debarring Official shall complete debarment proceedings and issue a written debarment decision.
              (d) Administrative Agreements. Matters may be resolved through administrative agreement at any stage of proceedings of a debarment action where a contractor agrees to appropriate terms. The specific effect of administrative agreements that incorporate terms regarding eligibility for DOI contracting will vary with the terms of the agreements. In general, such agreements resolve debarment concerns and thereby terminate any imposed or pending award ineligibility. In the event of an agreement, PAM will notify COs of the agreement and its terms.
              (e) Administrative Appeal. Administrative review of the Debarring Official's decision under FAR 9.406-3(e) may be sought as follows:
              (1) The contractor may within thirty (30) days of receipt of the decision, request the Debarring Official to reconsider the decision for clear material errors of fact or law which would change the outcome of the matter.
              (2) The Debarring Official may exercise his/her discretion and stay the debarment pending reconsideration review. The Debarring Official will notify the contractor in writing of the decision on reconsideration.
              (3) A review request under this section must be in writing, clearly state the specific findings believed to be in error and include the reasons or legal bases for the position.

              1409.407-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. Whenever a cause for suspension, as listed in FAR 9.407-2, becomes known to a DOI employee, the matter shall be referred by the case representative to the Suspending Official, in consultation, as appropriate, with the HCA involved, the SOL, and the OIG. The case representative will review the matter and, if warranted, prepare and submit to the Debarring Official for consideration an Action Referral Memorandum (ARM) with supporting documentation.
              (b) Notice of Suspension. After review of the ARM, if appropriate, the Debarring Official shall initiate a suspension by taking the actions listed in FAR 9.407-3(c), and advising the contractor of the Department's process for contesting the action.
              (c) Decision making process. (1) For suspension actions based upon an indictment or equivalent charging document, or where there is no genuine dispute over material facts, consistent with FAR 9.407-3(d), or in which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of DOJ advice, the Suspending Official shall make a decision on the basis of the information in the administrative record, including any submission by the contractor. Where the proceeding includes an oral PMIO to the Suspending Official, the PMIO will be conducted in an informal business meeting format and tape recorded for the administrative record.
              (2) For actions listed under FAR 9.407-3(b)(2), when the Debarring Official concludes from information in a contractor's response to the proposed action notice that facts material to the existence of a cause for debarment are genuinely in dispute, the Suspending Official may refer the disputed material facts to another official for hearing and findings of fact.
              (i) The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Suspension Program fact-finding procedures.
              (ii) The fact-finding proceeding will be transcribed. The reporter's fees and other direct costs associated with the hearing shall be borne by the bureau or office initiating the suspension referral, except in the case of actions initiated by the OIG. For actions initiated by the OIG, costs will be borne by Bureaus and/or offices out of which the matter arose. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made available to the contractor under the condition in FAR 9.407-3(b)(2)(ii).

              (iii) Subject to the provisions of 43 CFR part 1, the contractor, and any specifically named affiliates, may be represented by counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in such a manner that each party will have a full opportunity to present all information considered pertinent to the suspension.
              (iv) The fact-finding official will prepare findings of fact, certify the entire hearing record and provide said findings and record to the Suspending Official. The fact-finding official shall not make any recommendations unless the Suspending Official has expressly requested such recommendations in writing. Following receipt of the findings of fact, the Suspending Official shall complete suspension proceedings and issue a written decision. Matters may be resolved through an administrative agreement at any stage of the proceedings.
              (d) Administrative Agreements. Matters may be resolved through an administrative agreement at any stage of proceedings in resolution of a suspension action where a contractor agrees to appropriate terms. The specific effect of administrative agreements that incorporate terms regarding eligibility for DOI contracting will vary with the terms of the agreements. In general, such agreements resolve suspension concerns and thereby terminate award ineligibility. An administrative agreement resolving a suspension action may by its terms be an interim agreement. In the event of an agreement, PAM will notify COs of the agreement and its terms.
              (e) Administrative Appeal. Administrative review of the Suspending Official's decision under FAR 9.407-3(d) may be sought as follows:
              (1) The contractor may within thirty (30) days of receipt of the decision, ask the Suspending Official to reconsider the decision for clear material errors of fact or law which would change the outcome of the matter.
              (2) The Suspending Official may in the exercise of discretion stay the debarment pending reconsideration review. The Suspending Official will notify the contractor in writing of the decision on reconsideration.
              (3) A review request under this section must be submitted in writing; clearly state the specific findings believed to be in error, and include the reasons or legal bases for the position.

              Waiver.
              (a) The Director, PAM, is authorized to waive any general rule or procedure in FAR Subpart 9.5, when such action is in the Government's interest.
              (b) Request for waivers shall be made by the HCA, through the appropriate SOL, to the Director, PAM. Each request shall include:
              (1) An analysis of the facts involving the potential or actual conflict, including benefits and detriments to the Government and prospective contractor(s);
              (2) A discussion of the factors which preclude avoiding, neutralizing or mitigating the conflict; and
              (3) Identification of the provision(s) in FAR Subpart 9.5 to be waived.

              Procedures.
              If the CO determines that contractor performance of the contemplated work is likely to create an organizational conflict of interest, then the contracting officer shall refer the documentation of the potential conflict and proposed resolution prepared in accordance with 7.105(b)(18) to the HCA for approval. Referrals to the HCA shall be initiated by the CO and reviewed by the SOL.

              General.
              The procedures set forth in the Federal Supply Schedule for Government-wide Commercial Credit Card Services, Treasury Financial Manual, TFM 4-4500, and “U.S. Department of Interior Handbook for Utilization of Government Wide Commercial Credit Card” issued by PAM contain guidance on using Government-wide purchase card services.

              Policy.
              (a) The purchase card shall be used in preference to other methods of procurement for purchases up to $3,000. Other small purchase methods (BPAs, imprest funds, third-party drafts, SF-44 forms, and purchase orders) may be used in lieu of the Government purchase card when it is more cost-effective or practicable.
              (b) The purchase card shall be issued primarily to personnel outside of procurement offices to purchase products and services up to the micro-purchase threshold ($2,000 for construction).
              (c) The purchase card may be used in procurement offices for purchases up to the simplified acquisition threshold ($50,000 if not interim FACNET certified) not to exceed individual warrant limitations.
              (d) Each contracting activity shall develop more specific procedures for use of purchase cards.

              Department of the Interior proposal and information handling procedures.
              (a) General. This section establishes procedures that must be used in addition to those prescribed in FAR 15.207, for the use and disclosure of trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information contained in solicited proposals.
              (b) Marking of solicited proposals. A solicited proposal may contain trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information which the offeror, or its subcontractors, prefers not to be disclosed to the public or used by the Government for any purpose other than evaluation of the proposal. To notify the Government of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information contained in a proposal, offerors must mark the cover page of the proposal and each affected page of the proposal with the legends specified in the solicitation provision at 1452.215-71, Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information—Department of the Interior. COs and other government personnel evaluating a proposal shall not refuse to consider the proposal because it contains information identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information.
              (c) Failure to mark. The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with 1452.215-71. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with 1452.215-71, the offeror concerned shall be notified promptly of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.
              (d) Solicitation provision. The provision at 1452.215-71, Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information—Department of the Interior, shall be inserted in all requests for proposals and requests for quotations.
            
            
              1415.207-71
              Confidentiality of proposal evaluation.
              (a) The safeguarding of evaluation data and information, including proposals, is essential in order to preserve the integrity of the proposal evaluation process. During the selection process, no member or advisor of any committee appointed to evaluate proposals shall discuss or disclose any information on the number, identity or content of proposals received to any other party (including supervisors) without the written approval of the CO. 18 U.S.C. 1905 prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of business, confidential or trade secret information unless authorized by law.

              (b) At the initial meeting of the committee, the CO shall brief all members and advisors on the sensitivity of the evaluation process and the prohibition against unauthorized disclosure of information. At this meeting each member and advisor shall sign a Confidentiality Certificate. During the proposal evaluation process, all proposals, evaluation notes, scoring sheets, and other materials shall be locked in file cabinets or drawers when not in use by committee members and advisors.
              (c) The CO shall be the single point of contact regarding communications received from outside parties relating to the acquisition and the evaluation and selection process. Any committee member or advisor who receives a communication from any outside party shall, without discussion, immediately refer the party to the CO. The CO will then determine what further action shall be taken, if any, in responding to the communication. Requests for information made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act shall be referred to the CO for reply. Proposal evaluation committee members and advisors shall not contact any offeror whose proposal is under evaluation. All communications with offerors shall be handled by the CO.
              (d) Bureaus and offices may only release proposals outside the Government for evaluation or advice in accordance with the following requirements:
              (1) Decisions to release proposals outside the Government for evaluation or advice shall be approved in writing by the HCA;
              (2) Outside evaluators and advisors shall sign a Conflict of Interest Certificate and a Confidentiality Certificate in a format approved by the HCA;
              (3) Any authorized restrictive legends placed on the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor, or by the Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted information made by the outside evaluator or advisor;
              (4) Upon completing the evaluation, all copies of the proposal, as well as any abstracts thereof, shall be returned to the Government office which initially furnished them for evaluation; and
              (5) All determinations to release the proposal outside the Government shall take into consideration requirements for avoiding individual conflicts of interest (see 1403.101) and organizational conflicts of interest (see 1409.5 and FAR Subpart 9.5), and the competitive relationship, if any, between the prospective contractor or subcontractor and the prospective outside evaluator.
              (e) If outside individuals will be voting members of the evaluation committee or otherwise participate in other than an advisory capacity, then the committee must be constituted as a Federal Advisory Committee in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (PL 92-463) and 308 DM 2. Since the Secretary must appoint such committees in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, there should be very few occasions when use of outside individuals as voting members is justified.
              (f) Outside evaluators will usually serve as advisors to the proposal evaluation committee and as such, are consultants. Consultants may be appointed as special employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3109 or contracted for in accordance with 1437.1.
              (g) Additional restrictions on the disclosure of acquisition evaluation information are listed in FAR Subpart 5.4.

              The CO shall initiate an audit by sending a completed form DI-1902, Request for Audit, to the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing, OIG (see 1453.215-70).
              (a) The CO shall allow at least 30 working days in assigning a realistic deadline for receipt of the audit report. In exceptional circumstances 20 working days may be allowed but the circumstances shall be documented in the contract file.
              (b) Upon receipt of a DI-1902, the OIG will conduct the audit or arrange for its conduct by the cognizant audit agency in accordance with 360 DM 3.7.
              (c) Upon receipt of the audit report, the CO and the price analyst (if assigned), shall discuss any questions regarding the report's contents with the cognizant auditor. If a question cannot be resolved or agreement cannot be reached on a recommendation in the report, the CO shall prepare a written statement for the contract file documenting the decision on the matter. A copy of the statement shall be promptly forwarded to the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing for information.

              (a) DOI's policy is to use a structured approach for determining the profit or fee prenegotiation objective in acquisition actions that require cost analysis based on the profit analysis factors in FAR 15.404-4, as implemented and supplemented in this section.
              (b) In addition to the factors listed in FAR 15.404-4(d), one additional factor, “Other Costs,” will be used in evaluating and determining a weighted profit or fee. For further guidance also refer to the Armed Services Pricing Manual (ASPM No. 1). The “Other Costs” factor shall include the contribution of all other direct costs including travel, direct support and hiring of consultants for contract performance.

              Department of the Interior price negotiation memorandum (PNM).
              (a) Policy. In addition to the information required in FAR 15.406-3, the PNM prepared by the CO shall include the information in paragraph (c) of this section to the extent such information is applicable to the negotiation.
              (b) Applicability. (1) The CO shall prepare a PNM documenting the negotiation of the initial contract award and any subsequent modifications affecting price, cost or fee, including revisions to the prices of contracts awarded through sealed bidding procedures. A PNM is not required for unilateral modifications such as exercising fixed price options or issuing change orders. The memorandum is required for concluding changes and settlements of claims and for issuing orders under Blanket Ordering Agreements, task orders and delivery orders that involve the negotiation of prices, estimated quantities or amounts.
              (2) For simplified acquisitions conducted pursuant to FAR Part 13, the documentation requirements of 1413.106 and FAR 13.106 shall be followed.
              (c) Procedures. When the CO prepares the memorandum prescribed in FAR 15.406-3, the following additional information shall be included to the extent it applies to the contract action. Information already contained in the contract file or in a previous PNM shall be referenced by location:
              (1) A discussion of the reason(s) why sealed bidding is not appropriate as required by FAR 6.401 (or cross-reference the file location of the existing explanation);
              (2) A memorandum identifying the type of contract used and why it was selected as required by FAR 16.103(d). The file location of any required determination and findings authorizing use of this type of contract (see Part 1416);

              (3) A history of the contract action including: Whether the action was synopsized or the basis for exemption under FAR 5.202, and file location of the synopsis; consideration given to the use of set-asides and file location of DI-1886 (see Subpart 1419.2); solicitation issuance date, closing date for receipt of proposals and extensions; (iv) sources solicited (reference file location); late proposal or proposal modification information required by FAR 15.208; and the file location of “Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition,” if applicable.
              (4) Evaluation of proposal(s), including: Evaluation factors used and weights (FAR 15.304); results of initial proposal evaluation (FAR 15.305); determination of competitive range (FAR 15.306); results of written or oral discussions conducted (FAR 15.306); discussion of final proposal revisions received (FAR 15.307) and results of final proposal evaluation; and basis for source selection. For formal source selection procedures (see 1415.303), information on the source selection plan, and the source selection decision including supporting documentation required by FAR 15.308.
              (5) If cost or pricing data were not required, the cost or price analysis performed in accordance with FAR 15.404-1.
              (6) If cost or pricing data were required, the cost analysis (FAR 15.404-1(c)) performed; and cost realism analysis (FAR 15.404-1(d)) and technical analysis (FAR 15.404-1(e)) performed, as applicable to the procurement.
              (7) If an audit report was required (FAR 15.404-2), COs shall specifically describe actions taken in response to significant audit findings, including the monetary value and decisions made with regard to any of the audit's questioned costs; i.e., COs shall identify the value of the questioned costs, indicate whether they will allow or disallow them, and provide an explanation for their decisions. For purposes of this section, “significant audit finding” and “questioned cost” are defined as those findings and/or costs cited or questioned in an external audit because of their relationship to unallowable costs claimed, a failure to comply with regulations or the terms of the contract, mathematical errors, and/or the duplication of costs. Questions and/or disagreements between the CO, price analyst (if assigned) and cognizant auditor as to an audit report's interpretation or recommendations regarding “significant audit finding” and/or “questioned costs” shall be clarified or resolved and appropriately documented. If a disagreement cannot be resolved or agreement cannot be reached, the CO shall prepare a written statement in the PNM that discusses the issue(s) in question and supports a final decision on the matter.
              (8) The basis for determining profit or fee as prescribed in FAR Subpart 15.404-4 and form DI-1920 (or file location).
              (d) Approval. The PNM shall be signed and dated by the contract specialist or contract negotiator who conducted the negotiation and approved by the CO.
              (e) Distribution. Whenever field pricing support has been obtained, copies of related PNMs shall be forwarded to the Assistant Inspector General for Auditing, OIG, not later than 15 days after the execution of the resulting contract, modification or close-out action.

              The contact point for the receipt and coordination of unsolicited proposals is the contracting office, which will acknowledge and review the proposal contents and determine the proper activity within the bureau/office to evaluate and process the proposal. The policy or contracting office shall acknowledge unsolicited proposals and forward each one to the processing activity in an expeditious manner. Each bureau/office shall establish procedures for receipt, reproduction and disposition of unsolicited proposals consistent with the requirements of FAR 15.6.

              General policy.
              HCAs, without the power of redelegation, shall be responsible for the establishment of annual goals. The purpose of these goals is to increase participation of small business and small disadvantaged businesses in contract and subcontract opportunities. Goals for contract awards to minority business enterprises and women-owned businesses shall also be developed.
              (a) All program goals must comply with the criteria established by OSDBU and shall reflect improvement in participation of small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses. The goal setting process shall be conducted as follows:
              (1) Proposed goals are to be submitted by contracting activities to OSDBU by August 15th for the next fiscal year. To the greatest extent possible, the goals shall be based on advance acquisition plans (see Subpart 1407.1), budget justifications, and past performance.
              (2) OSDBU shall be responsible for consolidating bureau and office goals, performing trend analysis, and submitting proposed Departmental goals to SBA, and the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), Department of Commerce.
              (3) Bureau and office goals shall be negotiated and finalized with the OSDBU based on current plans and budget projections. OSDBU shall negotiate final Departmental goals with SBA, and MBDA.
              (4) Since goals are expressed as a percentage of planned acquisition dollars, final budget approvals may change specific dollar goals.

              (b) HCAs may request revision of goals from OSDBU when final budget approvals result in a change of plus or minus 15% in planned acquisition dollars or in instances when a disproportionate change in the mix of products or services is required. The goal setting process with the Bureau/Offices shall be completed by December 31st of each year.
              
              (c) In accordance with 111 DM 8, OSDBU is responsible for performing all functions and duties prescribed in FAR 19.201(d) and for:
              (1) Developing and maintaining policies, procedures, regulations, and guidelines for the effective administration of the Department's small business and small disadvantaged business programs; and,
              (2) Providing functional direction and policy guidance to personnel in the implementation of the programs under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
              (d) HCAs without authority to redelegate shall:
              (1) Appoint a full-time BUDS (e.g., procurement analyst or other non-operational contract person), for each contracting office where:
              (i) Annual contract obligations regularly exceed $20 million or represent a substantial part of the bureau's total contracting program; and,
              (ii) The number, type, and size of contract transactions provide sufficient opportunities for small business and small disadvantaged business participation.
              (2) Appoint a part-time BUDS (e.g., procurement analyst or other non-operational contract person), for each contracting office where the nature of the contracting program requires such action to ensure accomplishment of annual program goals;
              (e) Each BUDS shall perform the duties listed at FAR 19.201(d)(5)(6), and (10), 405 DM 1, and in the BUDS Standard Operating Procedures Handbook (405 DM 2).

              Acquisition screening and BUDS recommendations.
              (a) For open market acquisitions estimated to exceed the SAT, the DI Form 1886, “Acquisition Screening and Review Form,” shall be completed by the CO and signed as indicated in Block 20 of the form. The completed form shall be placed in the solicitation/contract file prior to requesting quotations, publication of a FedBizOpps solicitation notice, or publication of a notice of intent to award a sole source contract.
              (b) For open market acquisitions estimated to be greater than the micro-purchase threshold and less than the SAT that are not reserved for small business or proceeding under the 8(a) program, the DI Form 1886 shall be completed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Open market acquisitions, including charge card transactions, estimated to be less than the micro-purchase threshold are not routinely screened, but may be upon request by the purchaser.
              (d) For Federal Supply Schedule competitions estimated to exceed the SAT and for which the source list contains less than three small businesses, the DI Form 1886 shall be completed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (e) Federal Supply Schedule buys below the SAT are not routinely screened, but may be upon request by the CO.
              (f) If the proposed method of acquisition is non-competitive, the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition shall be attached to the DI Form 1886.
              (g) Advance acquisition plans developed pursuant to FAR Part 7 shall be attached to the DI Form 1886.
              (h) The CO shall document the rationale for not accepting a SBS recommendation on DI Form 1886, under “Notes.” (See FAR 19.202.) Disagreements between the CO and the SBS concerning the decision to use a set aside or the 8(a) program shall be resolved by the BPC. The BPC shall annotate the resolution, with signature, in the “Notes” section of the form. The BPC may consult with the OSDBU to obtain assistance in resolving the disagreement.

              Class set-aside for construction acquisitions.

              (a) Acquisitions for construction (as defined in FAR 2.101) estimated to cost $2 million or less shall be set-aside on a class basis for exclusive participation by small business concerns. This class set-aside does not apply when:
              (1) The acquisition is procured using simplified acquisition procedures;
              (2) Use of a set-aside is precluded by the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (SBCDP) (See FAR 19.10);
              (3) A non-competitive acquisition has been approved under the procedures of FAR 6.3;

              Determining the need for a subcontracting plan.
              The CO's determination that no subcontract possibilities exist for a proposed contractual action shall be reviewed by the BUDS prior to the approval by a level above the CO, and a copy shall be forwarded to OSDBU within 5 working days of execution, but in no case later than the date of contract award.

              1419.705-3
              Preparing the solicitation.
              In solicitations containing subcontract plan requirements, COs should consider evaluating offered subcontract plans and the offerors' past subcontracting compliance and accomplishments in the evaluation and selection of proposals. This would be particularly appropriate for acquisitions known to offer significant subcontracting opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses or which include work previously performed by a small business. When used, this factor must be evaluated in such a way that the relative ranking or scoring of small business offerors is not adversely affected by the lack of a subcontract plan.

              In addition to the actions specified in FAR 19.705-6, the CO shall also be responsible for the following:
              (a) Forwarding a copy of each approved subcontracting plan to OSDBU within 10 working days after approval of the plan.
              (b) Ensuring that the contractor forwards the original copy of the Standard Form 295, Summary Contracting Report, to the Department of the Interior, Director, OSDBU, 18th & C Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20240, Rm. 2747.
              (c) Forwarding a copy of the Standard Form 294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts, received from individual contractors, within 10 working days, to OSDBU.
              (d) Conducting on-site business and economic development program management reviews (see 405 DM 1) of a prime contractor's small and disadvantaged business subcontracting program. Reviews shall be conducted as required based on problems perceived such as insufficient progress in meeting subcontracting goals. The result of the review shall be documented in writing using the format shown at 1453.303-70. At the discretion of the CO, the BUDS may conduct the reviews. In addition to required bureau/office internal distribution, a copy of the review report shall be submitted to OSDBU within 60 calendar days after completion of the review.

              Selecting acquisitions for the 8(a) Program.

              1426.7000
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementation of Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93-638, 88 Stat. 2205, 25 U.S.C. 450e(b)).

                On or near an Indian reservation means on a reservation or the distance within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) that a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to commute to and from in the course of a work day.
            
            
              1426.7002
              Statutory requirements.
              Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act requires that any contract or subcontract entered into pursuant to that Act, the Act of April 16, 1934 (48 Stat. 596; 25 U.S.C. 452), as amended (the Johnson-O'Malley Act), or any other Act authorizing contracts with Indian organizations or for the benefit of Indians shall require that, to the greatest extent feasible:
              (a) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the administration of such contracts shall be given to Indians, and
              (b) Preference in the award of subcontracts in connection with the administration of such contracts shall be given to Indian organizations and to Indian-owned economic enterprises as defined in Section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Sec. 3, Pub. L. 93-262; 88 Stat. 77; 25 U.S.C. 1452).
            
            
              1426.7003
              Applicability and contract clause.
              (a) The CO shall insert the clause at 1452.226-70, Indian Preference—Department of the Interior, in solicitations issued and contracts awarded by:
              (1) The Bureau of Indian Affairs;

              (2) A contracting activity other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs when the contract is entered into pursuant to an act specifically authorizing contracts with Indian organizations; and,
              (3) A contracting activity other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs where the work to be performed is specifically for the benefit of Indians and is in addition to any incidental benefits which might otherwise accrue to the general public.
              (b) The CO shall insert the clause at 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program—Department of the Interior, in all solicitations issued and contracts awarded by a contracting activity which may exceed $50,000, which contain the clause required by paragraph (a) of this section and where it is determined by the CO, prior to solicitation, that the work under the contract will be performed in whole or in part on or near an Indian reservation(s). The Indian Preference Program clause may also be included in solicitations issued and contracts awarded by a contracting activity which may not exceed $50,000, but which contain the clause required by paragraph (a) of this section and which, in the opinion of the CO, offer substantial opportunities for Indian employment, training or subcontracting.
            
            
              1426.7004
              Compliance enforcement.
              (a) The CO is responsible for conducting periodic reviews of the contractor to ensure compliance with the requirements of the clauses prescribed in 1426.7003. These reviews may be conducted with the assistance of the Indian Tribe(s) concerned.
              (b) Complaints of noncompliance with the requirements of the clauses prescribed under 1426.7003 received in writing by the contracting activity shall be promptly investigated by the CO. A written disposition of the complaint shall be prepared by the CO.
            
            
              1426.7005
              Tribal preference requirements.
              (a) Where the work under a contract is to be performed on an Indian reservation, the CO may supplement the clause at 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program—Department of the Interior, by adding specific Indian preference requirements of the Tribe on whose reservation the work is to be performed. The supplemental requirements shall be jointly developed for the contract by the CO and the Tribe. Supplemental preference requirements must represent a further implementation of the requirements of Section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 and must be approved by the SOL for legal sufficiency before being added to a solicitation and resultant contract. Any supplemental preference requirements to be added to the clause at 1452.226-71 shall be included in the solicitation and clearly identified in order to ensure uniform understanding of the additional requirements by all prospective bidders or offerors.
              (b) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to preclude Tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own tribal preference requirements. Such independently developed tribal preference requirements shall not, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, become a requirement in contracts covered under this subpart 1426.70 and must not hinder the Government's right to award contracts and to administer their provisions.

              (a)(1) Exceptions. The Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division shall issue a decision on the appeal of a small business concern or nonprofit organization of the use of exceptions under FAR 27.303(e)(1).
              (2) If the Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division determines that the appeal notice raises a genuine dispute over the material facts, a fact-finding hearing shall be conducted by OHA. The hearing shall be conducted at a location convenient to the parties concerned as determined by the Director, OHA, and on a date and time stated. The contractor may be represented by counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either party. The proceedings shall be conducted expeditiously and in such a manner that each party will have a full opportunity to present all information considered pertinent to the determination. A transcribed record of the proceedings shall be made and shall be made available at cost to the contractor upon request, unless the requirement for the transcribed record is waived by mutual agreement of the contractor and OHA.

              (3) OHA shall prepare written findings of fact and transmit them to the Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division.
              (4) OHA may hear oral arguments after fact-finding provided that the contractor, its counsel or other duly authorized representative, is present in order to have the opportunity to make arguments and rebuttal.

The notice shall be prepared and signed by the Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division. Within the time constraints, if the Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division determines any information submitted by the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) after notice of march-in is received raises a genuine dispute over material facts, a fact-finding hearing shall be conducted by OHA. The Associate Solicitor for the General Law Division shall issue a final determination, after consideration of any further written or oral arguments from the parties. An unfavorable determination to a contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) shall be subject to appeal.

COs may approve contractor requests for assignment of rights or exclusive licenses after obtaining the advice of the Assistant Solicitor for Acquisitions and Intellectual Property.

              1433.104
              Protests to GAO.
              (a) General procedure. (1) A protester shall furnish a copy of its complete protest simultaneously to the CO and the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property. Upon being telephonically advised by the GAO of the receipt of a protest, the SOL shall inform the appropriate contracting activity which shall immediately notify the CO. For protests concerning Federal Information Processing (FIP) acquisitions, the SOL shall also inform the Director, Office of Information Resources Management (PIR), who, in turn, shall notify the appropriate bureau Information Resources Management contact and GSA official. The CO shall prepare the protest report as required by FAR 33.104(a)(3).
              (2) The SOL will furnish promptly GAO's written notice of the protest to the cognizant contracting activity which, in turn, shall promptly transmit copies to the CO. The CO shall begin notification as prescribed in FAR 33.104(a)(2). The notification letters shall contain a specified period of time for submission of comments and include instructions that any comments submitted to the GAO should also be submitted simultaneously to the CO and the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property. Copies of the CO's notification letters shall be sent concurrently to the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property.
              (3)(i) The contracting activity shall have no more than 15 working days from the date of telephonic notification by the SOL to deliver the protest report to the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property. For reports involving use of the 10 working day express option, the SOL shall establish the report delivery date after consultation with the contracting activity.
              (ii) If required, the SOL shall make the request for an extension in the report due date.
              (iii) In addition to the requirements of FAR 33.104(a)(3), the report shall be appropriately titled and dated; shall cite the GAO file number; and shall be signed by the CO. Reports shall be prepared with the assistance of the local attorney-advisor of the SOL. A statement shall be included giving an estimate of the length of time an award may be delayed without significant expense or difficulty in performance. If appropriate, the report shall contain a statement regarding any urgency for the acquisition and the extent to which a delay in award may result in significant performance difficulties or additional expense to the Government. The contracting activity shall submit the CO's report to the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property, who will then submit it to GAO and provide a copy to each interested party who responded to the notification pursuant to FAR 33.104(a)(2).
              (b) Protests before award. (1) The finding to award, notwithstanding protest, shall be written by the CO, reviewed by the SOL, and approved by the HCA. A copy of the approved written finding shall be placed in the contract file.
              (2) The SOL shall be responsible for notifying GAO of the finding to award notwithstanding protest.
              (c) Protests after award. (1) The CO shall notify the SOL prior to suspending or terminating the awarded contract.
              
              (2) The written finding to authorize continued contract performance, notwithstanding protest, shall be written by the CO, reviewed by the SOL, and approved by the HCA.
              (3) The SOL shall be responsible for notifying GAO of the finding to continue contract performance not withstanding protest.
              (d) Notice to GAO. The CO shall prepare the report required by FAR 33.104(g), and coordinate it with the Assistant Solicitor, Acquisitions and Intellectual Property, and the Director, PAM, prior to HCA signature (signature level not redelegable). For protests regarding FIP acquisitions, the CO shall also coordinate the report with the Director, PIR. After signature, the report shall be forwarded to the Assistant Solicitor for Acquisitions and Intellectual Property for transmission to GAO.

            Subpart 1437.1—Service Contracts—General
            
              1437.102
              Policy.
              The HCA is responsible for establishing internal review and approval procedures for service contracts in accordance with OFPP Policy Letter 93-1, Management Oversight of Service Contracting. Special attention shall be directed to avoidance of contracting for inherently governmental functions, as well as contract administration in the area of incurred cost monitoring to complement work progress monitoring.
            
            
              1437.103
              Contracting officer responsibility.
              (a) While recognizing that program officials are responsible for accurately describing the need to be filled or the problem to be solved through the service contract, COs shall:
              (1) Award and administer contracts in a manner that will provide the customer with quality services on time and within budget;
              (2) Ensure that requirements are clearly defined and appropriate performance standards are included in the contract;
              (3) Utilize the checklist in paragraph (b) of this section, or bureau substitute, to ensure compliance with general policies and the specific guidance in OFPP Policy Letters 92-1, Inherently Governmental Functions, 91-2, Service Contracting, and 89-1, Conflicts of Interest Policies Applicable to Consultants;
              (4) Work in close collaboration with the beneficiaries of the services being purchased to ensure that contractor performance meets contract requirements and performance standards;.
              (b) Following is a checklist to aid analysis and review of requirements for service contracts.
              (1) General. (i) Is the statement of work complete, with a clear-cut division of responsibility between the contracting parties?
              (ii) Is it stated in terms the market can satisfy?
              (iii) Does the statement of work encompass all commercially available services that can meet the actual functional need (eliminates any nonessential preferences that may thwart full and open competition)?
              (iv) Is the statement of work performance-based to the maximum extent possible (i.e., is the acquisition structured around the purpose of the work to be performed, as opposed to either the manner by which the work is to be performed or a broad and imprecise statement of work? Does the statement of work follow OFPP Pamphlet IV, A Guide to Writing and Administering Performance Statements of Work for Service Contracts (Supplement 2 to OMB Circular A-76)?, as described in OFPP Pamphlet IV?)
              (2) Inherently governmental functions. If the response to the first question below is affirmative, the contract requirement is for an inherently Governmental function that Government officials must perform. If the response to the second question below is affirmative, the contract may be for an inherently governmental function.
              (i) Is the requirement for a function that is listed in Appendix A of OFPP Policy Letter 92-1?
              (ii) If the function is not listed in Appendix A, do any of the factors in the totality of the circumstances analysis discussed in section 7(b) of the Policy Letter 92-1 indicate that the function may be inherently governmental?
              (iii) Are Government employees currently performing the task to be contracted out? If so, has OMB Circular A-76 been consulted?
              (3) Cost effectiveness. If the response to any of the following questions is negative, the agency may not have a valid requirement or not be obtaining the requirement in the most cost effective manner.
              
              (i) Is the statement of work written so that it supports the need for a specific service?
              (ii) Is the statement of work written so that it permits adequate evaluation of contractor versus in-house cost and performance?
              (iii) Are the choices of contract type, quality assurance plan, competition strategy, or other related acquisition strategies and procedures in the acquisition plan appropriate to ensure good contractor performance to meet the user's needs?
              (iv) If a cost reimbursement contract is contemplated, is the acquisition plan adequate to ensure that the contractor will have the incentive to control costs under the contract?
              (v) Is the acquisition plan adequate to address the cost effectiveness of using contractor support (either long-term or short-term) versus in-house performance?
              (vi) Is the cost estimate, or other supporting cost information, adequate to enable the contracting office to effectively determine whether costs are reasonable?
              (vii) Is the statement of work adequate to describe the requirement in terms of what is to be performed as opposed to how the work is to be accomplished?
              (viii) Is the acquisition plan adequate to ensure that there is proper consideration given to quality and best value?
              (4) Control. If the response to any of the following questions is negative, there may be a control problem.
              (i) Are there sufficient resources to evaluate contractor performance when the statement of work requires the contractor to provide advice, analysis and evaluation, opinions, alternatives, or recommendations that could significantly influence agency policy development or decision-making?
              (ii) Does the quality assurance plan provide for adequate monitoring of contractor performance?
              (iii) Is the statement of work written so that it specifies a contract deliverable or requires progress reporting on contractor performance?
              (iv) Is agency expertise adequate to independently evaluate the contractor's approach, methodology, results, options, conclusions or recommendations?
              (v) Is the requirement for a function or service absent from the list in Appendix B of OFPP Policy Letter 92-1? If it is similar to a function or service on that list, greater management scrutiny may be required.
              (5) Conflicts of Interest. If the response to any of the following questions is affirmative, there may be a conflict of interest.
              (i) Can the potential offeror perform under the contract in such a way as to devise solutions or make recommendations that would influence the award of future contracts to that contractor?
              (ii) If the requirement is for support services (such as system engineering or technical direction), were any of the potential offerors involved in developing the system design specifications or in the production of the system?
              (iii) Has a potential offeror participated in earlier work involving the same program or activity that is the subject of the present contract wherein the offeror had access to source selection or propriety information not available to other offerors competing for the contract?
              (iv) Will the contractor be evaluating a competitor's work?
              (v) Does the contract allow the contractor to accept its own products or activities on behalf of the Government?

              (vi) Will the work under this contract put the contractor in a position to influence government decision-making, e.g., developing regulations that will affect the contractor's current or future business?
              (vii) Will the work under this contract effect the interests of the contractor's other clients?
              (viii) Are any of the potential offerors, or their personnel who will perform the contract, former agency officials who—while employed by the agency—personally and substantially participated in the development of the requirement for, or the procurement of, these services within the past two years?
              (6) Competition. If the response to any of the following questions is negative, completion may be unnecessarily limited.
              
              (i) Is the statement of work defined so as to avoid overly restrictive specifications or performance standards?
              (ii) Is the contract formulated in such a way as to avoid creating a continuous and dependent arrangement with the same contractor?
              (iii) Is the use of an indefinite quantity or term contract arrangement appropriate to obtain the required services?
              (iv) Will the requirement be obtained through the use of full and open competition?
            
            
              1437.170
              Special service contract requirements.

              Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information—Department of the Interior.
              As prescribed in 1415.207-70, insert the following provision:
              
                Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information—Department of the Interior (APR 1984)
                (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below:
                (1) “Trade Secret” means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities.
                (2) “Confidential commercial or financial information” means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers “commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential,” and exemption (9), which covers “geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells.”
                (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend:
                “The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract.”

                (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend:
                
                “This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.”
                (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction.
                (e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.
                (f) The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error.

                Indian Preference—Department of the Interior (APR 1984)

                (a) The Contractor agrees to give preferences to Indians who can perform the work required regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex, religion, or tribal affiliation for training and employment opportunities under this contract and, to the extent feasible consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, training and employment preferences and opportunities shall be provided to Indians regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex, religion, or tribal affiliation who are not fully qualified to perform under this contract. The Contractor also agrees to give preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in the awarding of any subcontracts consistent with the efficient performance of this contract. The Contractor shall maintain such records as are necessary to indicate compliance with this paragraph.
                (b) In connection with the Indian employment preference requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall also provide opportunities for training incident to such employment. Such training shall include on-the-job, classroom, or apprenticeship training which is designed to increase the vocational effectiveness of an Indian employee.
                (c) If the Contractor is unable to fill its training and employment needs after giving full consideration to Indians as required by this clause, those needs may be satisfied by selection of persons other than Indians in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Equal Opportunity.”
                (d) If no Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises are available for awarding of subcontracts in connection with the work performed under this contract, the Contractor agrees to comply with the provisions of this contract involving utilization of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, or labor surplus area concerns.
                (e) As used in this clause:
                (1) “Indian” means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe. If the Contractor has reason to doubt that a person seeking employment preference is an Indian, the contractor shall grant the preference but shall require the individual within thirty (30) days to provide evidence from the Tribe concerned that the person is a member of that Tribe.
                (2) “Indian organization” means the governing body of any Indian Tribe or entity established or recognized by such governing body in accordance with the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 77; 25 U.S.C. 1451); and
                (3) “Indian-owned economic enterprise” means any Indian-owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of profit provided that such Indian ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise.
                (4) “Indian Tribe” means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 668; 43 U.S.C. 1601) which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.
                (f) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of the clause including this paragraph (f) in each subcontract awarded under this contract.
                (g) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contractor's right to proceed may be terminated in whole or in part by the Contracting Officer and the work completed in a manner determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the best interests of the Government.
              
              (End of clause)
            
            
              1452.226-71
              Indian Preference Program.
              As prescribed in 1426.7003(b), insert the following clause in all solicitations and contracts awarded by the contracting activity that may exceed $50,000, contain the clause at 1452.226-70, and where it is determined by the Contracting Officer, prior to solicitation, that the work under the contract will be performed in whole or in part on or near an Indian reservation(s). The clause may also be included in solicitations issued and contracts awarded by a contracting activity not exceeding $50,000 that contain the clause at 1452.226-70 and which, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, offer substantial opportunities for Indian employment, training, and subcontracting.
              
                Indian Preference Program— Department of the Interior (APR 1984)
                (a) In addition to the requirements of the clause of this contract entitled “Indian Preference—Department of the Interior,” the Contractor agrees to establish and conduct an Indian preference program which will expand the opportunities for Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises to receive a preference in the awarding of subcontracts and which will expand opportunities for Indians to receive preference for training and employment in connection with the work to be performed under this contract. In this connection, the Contractor shall —
                (1) Designate a liaison officer who will:
                (i) Maintain liaison with the Government and Tribe(s) on Indian preference matters;
                (ii) Supervise compliance with the provisions of this clause; and

                (iii) Administer the Contractor's Indian preference program.
                
                (2) Advise its recruitment sources in writing and include a statement in all advertisements for employment that Indian applicants will be given preference in employment and training incident to such employment.
                (3) Not less than twenty (20) calendar days prior to commencement of work under this contract, post a written notice in the Tribal office of any reservations on which or near where the work under this contract is to be performed, which sets forth the Contractor's employment needs and related training opportunities. The notice shall include the approximate number and types of employees needed, the approximate dates of employment; the experience or special skills required for employment, if any; training opportunities available; and all other pertinent information necessary to advise prospective employees of any other employment requirements. The Contractor shall also request the Tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the work is to be performed to provide assistance to the Contractor in filling its employment needs and training opportunities. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to contact in regard to the posting of notices and requests for Tribal assistance.
                (4) Establish and conduct a subcontracting program which gives preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as subcontractors and suppliers under this contract. Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, the Contractor shall give public notice of existing subcontracting opportunities by soliciting bids or proposals only from Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. The Contractor shall request assistance and information on Indian firms qualified as suppliers or subcontractors from the Tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the work under the contract is to be performed. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to be contacted in regard to the request for assistance and information. Public notices and solicitations for existing subcontracting opportunities shall provide an equitable opportunity for Indian firms to submit bids or proposals by including—
                (i) A clear description of the supplies or services required including quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules which facilitate the participation of Indian firms;
                (ii) A statement indicating the preference will be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in accordance with Section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638; (88 Stat. 2205; 25 U.S.C. 450e(b));
                (iii) Definitions for the terms “Indian organization” and “Indian-owned economic enterprise” as prescribed under the “Indian Preference—Department of the Interior” clause of this contract;
                (iv) A representation to be completed by the bidder or offeror that it is an Indian organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise; and
                (v) A closing date for receipt of bids or proposals which provides sufficient time for preparation and submission of a bid or proposal. If after soliciting bids from Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, no responsible bid is received, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the “Indian Preference—Department of the Interior” clause of this contract. If one or more responsible bids are received, award shall be made to the low responsible bidder if the bid price is determined to be reasonable. If the low responsive bid is determined to be unreasonable as to price, the Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable price and award a subcontract. If a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the “Indian Preference—Department of the Interior” clause of the contract.
                (5) Maintain written records under this contract which indicate:
                (i) The names and addresses of all Indians seeking employment for each employment position available under this contract;
                (ii) The number and types of positions filled by Indians and non-Indians, and the name, address and position of each Indian employed under this contract;
                (iii) For those positions where there are both Indian and non-Indian applicants, and a non-Indian is selected for employment, the reason(s) why the Indian applicant was not selected;
                (iv) Actions taken to give preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises for subcontracting opportunities which exist under this contract;
                (v) Reasons why preference was not given to Indian firms as subcontractors or suppliers for each requirement where it was determined by the Contractor that such preference would not be consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, and
                (vi) The names and addresses of all Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises contacted, and receiving subcontract awards under this contract.
                (6) The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer for approval a semiannual report which summarizes the Contractor's Indian preference program and indicates the number and types of available positions filled and dollar amounts of all subcontracts awarded to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises and all other firms.

                (7) Records maintained pursuant to this clause will be kept available for review by the Government until expiration of one (1) year after final payment under this contract, or for such longer period as may be required by any other clause of this contract or by applicable law or regulation.
                (b) For purpose of this clause, the following definitions of terms shall apply:

The Buy Indian Act provides that, “so far as may be practicable, Indian labor shall be employed, and purchases of the products (including, but not limited to printing, notwithstanding any other law) of Indian industry may be made in open market at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.” Thus, IA may use the Buy Indian Act to give preference to IEEs through set-asides when acquiring supplies, services, and covered construction to meet IA needs and requirements. IA must contract for covered construction in accordance with FAR Part 36.
              (b) IA or any other bureau or office of the Department of the Interior delegated the authority to make acquisitions under the Buy Indian Act may not use the Buy Indian Act to give preference to IEEs through set-asides when acquiring construction that is not covered construction.

              (8) When acquiring architect-engineer services, solicit proposals and evaluate potential contractors in accordance with FAR Part 36 and DIAR Subpart 1436.6.
              (d) This paragraph applies to solicitations that are not restricted to participation of IEEs.
              (1) If an interested IEE is identified after a market survey has been performed and a solicitation has been issued, but before the date established for receipt of offers, the contracting office must provide a copy of the solicitation to this enterprise. In this case, the CO:
              (i) Will not give preference under the Buy Indian Act to the IEE, and
              (ii) May extend the date for receipt of offers when practical.
              (2) If more than one IEE comes forward subsequent to the solicitation, but prior to the date established for receipt of offers, the CO may cancel the solicitation and re-compete it as an IEE set-aside.
              (e) When only one offer is received from a responsible IEE in response to an acquisition set-aside under paragraph (a) of this section:

              General.
              (a) The CO must insert the provision at 1452.280-4, INDIAN ECONOMIC ENTERPRISE REPRESENTATION, in all solicitations regardless of dollar value that are set aside for IEEs in accordance this part.
              (b) To be considered for an award under 1480.503 or 1480.504-1, an offeror must represent that it meets the definition of “Indian economic enterprise” in response to a specific solicitation set-aside in accordance with the Buy Indian Act and this part.
              (c) The enterprise must meet the definition of “Indian economic enterprise” throughout the following time periods:
              (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a solicitation;
              (2) At the time of contract award; and
              (3) During the full term of the contract.
              (d) If, after award, a contractor no longer meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, the contractor must provide immediate, written notification to the CO. The notification must include:
              (1) Full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status; and
              (2) A description of actions, if any, that must be taken to regain eligibility.
              (e) Failure to provide immediate written notification required by paragraph (d) of this section means that:
              (1) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible for future contract awards under this part; and
              (2) IA may consider termination for default if it is determined to be in the best interest of the government.
              (f) The CO will accept an offeror's representation in a specific bid or proposal that it is an IEE unless another interested party challenges the IEE representation or the CO has reason to question the representation.

              (g) Participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an IEE ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.
            
            
              1480.802
              Representation provision.
              (a) IA contracting offices must provide copies of the IEE representation to any interested parties upon written request.

              (b) The submission of a Solicitation Mailing List Application by an enterprise does not remove the requirement for it to provide representation as an IEE, as required by this part, if it wishes to be considered as an offeror for a specific solicitation. COs may determine the validity of the contents of the applicant's representation.
              (c) Any false or misleading information submitted by an enterprise when submitting an offer in consideration for an award set aside under the Buy Indian Act is a violation of the law punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. False claims submitted as part of contract performance are subject to the penalties enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3729 to 3731 and 18 U.S.C. 287.

              Representation process.
              (a) Only IEEs may participate in acquisitions set aside in accordance with the Buy Indian Act and this part. IA procedure supports responsible IEEs and seeks to prevent circumvention or abuse of the Buy Indian Act.
              (b) Eligibility is based on information furnished by the enterprise to an IA CO in the IEE representation at 1452.280-4 in response to a specific solicitation under the Buy Indian Act.
              (c) The CO may ask the appropriate Regional Solicitor to review the enterprise's representation.
              (d) The IEE representation does not relieve the CO of the obligation for determining contractor responsibility, as required by FAR Subpart 9.1.

              (c) To be considered timely, a challenge must be received by the CO no later than 10 days after the basis of challenge is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.

              (d) Upon receiving a timely challenge, the CO must:
              (1) Notify the challenger of the date it was received, and that the representation of the enterprise being challenged is under consideration by IA; and
              (2) Furnish to the economic enterprise (whose representation is being challenged) a request to provide detailed information on its eligibility by certified mail, return receipt requested.

              (e) Within 3 days after receiving a copy of the challenge and IA's request for detailed information, the challenged offeror must file with the CO a complete statement answering the allegations in the challenge, and furnish evidence to support its position on representation. If the offeror does not submit the required material within the 3 days, or another period of time granted by the CO, IA may assume that the offeror does not intend to dispute the challenge and IA must not award to the challenged offeror.
              (f) Within 10 days after receiving a challenge, the challenged offeror's response and other pertinent information, the CO must determine the representation status of the challenged offeror and notify the challenger and the challenged offeror of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested, and make known the option to appeal the determination to the Office of Acquisition and Property Management, Department of the Interior (PAM).
              (g) If the representation accompanying an offer is challenged and subsequently upheld by the PAM, the written notification of this action must state the reason(s). The PAM may review the economic enterprise for possible suspension or debarment recommendations.
            
            
              1480.903
              Award in the face of challenge.
              (a) Award of a contract in the face of challenge may be made on the basis of the CO's written determination that the challenged offeror's representation is valid.
              (1) This determination is final for IA unless it is appealed to the PAM, and the CO is notified of the appeal before award.
              (2) If an award was made before the time the CO received notice of appeal, the contract must be presumed to be valid.
              (b) After receiving a challenge involving an offeror being considered for award, the CO must not award the contract until the CO has determined the validity of the representation, or 10 days have expired since the CO received the challenge, whichever occurs first. Award must be made when the CO determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest, or the supplies and services are urgently required, or a prompt award will otherwise be advantageous to the Government.
              (c) If a timely challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received before award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO must notify eligible offerors within one day that the award will be withheld and a time extension for acceptance is requested.
              (d) If a challenge on representation is filed with the CO and received after award in response to a specific offer and solicitation, the CO need not suspend contract performance or terminate the awarded contract unless the CO believes that an award may be invalidated and a delay would prejudice the Government's interest. However, if contract performance is to be suspended, a mutual no cost agreement will be sought.
            
            
              1480.904
              Challenge not timely.
              If a CO receives an untimely filed challenge of a representation, the CO must notify the challenger that the challenge cannot be considered on the instant acquisition but will be considered in any future actions. However, the CO may question at any time, before or after award, the representation of an IEE.
