      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> (1) The Government is not bound by agreements with, or contractual commitments made to, prospective contractors by individuals who do not have delegated contracting authority. Unauthorized commitments do not follow the appropriate process for the expenditure of Government funds. Consequently, the Government may not be able to ratify certain actions, putting a contractor at risk for taking direction from a Federal official other than the contracting officer. See FAR 1.602-1. Government employees responsible for unauthorized commitments are subject to disciplinary action. Contractors perform at their own risk when accepting direction from unauthorized officials. Failure to follow statutory and regulatory processes for the expenditure of Government funds is a very serious matter.</P>
              <P>(2) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) is the official authorized to ratify an unauthorized commitment. No other re-delegations are authorized.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> (5) The HCA shall coordinate the request for ratification with the Office of General Counsel, General Law Division and submit a copy to the SPE.</P>

              <P>(a) The Agency head has delegated broad authority to the Chief Acquisition Officer, who in turn has further delegated this authority to the SPE. The SPE has further delegated specific acquisition authority to the Operating and Staff Division heads and the HCAs. The HCA (non-delegable) shall select, appoint, and terminate the appointment of contracting officers.</P>
              <P>(b) To ensure proper control of redelegated acquisition authorities, HCAs shall maintain a file containing successive delegations of HCA authority through the contracting officer level.</P>

              <P>This subpart implements Section 220 of Public Law 112-74, FY 2012 Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations Act, which requires, semi-annual reporting on the use of funds from the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), Public Law 111-148, sec. 4002. Contractors that receive awards (or modifications to existing awards) with a value of $25,000 or more funded, in whole or in part, from the PPHF, shall report information specified in the clause at 352.204-70, Prevention and Public Health Fund—Reporting Requirements, including, but not limited to—</P>
              <P>(a) The dollar amount of contractor invoices;</P>
              <P>(b) The supplies delivered and services performed; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In any contract action funded in whole or in part by the PPHF, the contracting officer shall indicate that the contract action is being made under the PPHF, and indicate which products or services are funded under the PPHF. This requirement applies whenever PPHF funds are used, regardless of the contract instrument.</P>
              <P>(b) To maximize transparency of PPHF funds that shall be reported by the contractor, the contracting officer shall structure contract awards to allow for separately tracking PPHF funds. For example, the contracting officer may consider awarding dedicated separate contracts when using PPHF funds or establishing contract line item number structures to prevent commingling of PPHF funds with other funds.</P>

              <P>(c) Contracting officers shall ensure that the contractor complies with the reporting requirements of 352.204-70. Upon receipt of each report, the contracting officer shall review it for completeness, address any clarity or completeness issues with the contractor, and submit the final approved report in Section 508 compliant format to an Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs point-of-contact for posting on HHS' PPHF Web site at <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/open/prevention/index.html</E> no later than 30 days after the end of the reporting period. If the contractor fails to comply with the reporting requirements, the contracting officer shall exercise appropriate contractual remedies.</P>
              <P>(d) The contracting officer shall make the contractor's failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the contractor's performance information under FAR subpart 42.15.</P>

This includes, but is not limited to, awarding or modifying orders against existing or new contracts issued under FAR subparts 8.4 and 16.5 that will be funded with PPHF funds. Contracting officers shall include this clause in any existing contract or order that will be funded with PPHF funds. This clause is not required for any contract or order which contains a prior version of the clause at 352.204-70.</P>

              <P>(a) It is HHS policy that all contractors comply with current and any future changes to 28 CFR part 36—Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in Commercial Facilities. For the purpose of this policy, accessibility is defined as both physical access to public <PRTPAGE P="15"/>accommodations and commercial facilities, and access to aids and services enabling individuals with sensory disabilities to fully participate in events in public accommodations and commercial facilities.</P>
              <P>(b) This policy applies to all contracts requiring contractors to conduct events in public accommodations and commercial facilities open to the public or involving HHS personnel, but not ad hoc meetings necessary or incidental to contract performance.</P>

              <P>The contractor shall submit a plan assuring that any event held will meet or exceed the minimum accessibility standards set forth in 28 CFR part 36.

              <P>Funding a conference through a HHS contract does not automatically imply HHS sponsorship, unless the conference is funded entirely by the agency. Also, HHS staff attendance or participation at a conference does not imply HHS conference sponsorship. Accordingly, for non-conference contracts funded entirely by HHS prior to a contractor claiming HHS sponsorship, the contractor must provide the contracting officer a written request for permission to designate HHS the conference sponsor. The OPDIV or STAFFDIV (operating division or staff division) head, or designee, shall approve such requests. The determination on what constitutes a “conference contract” or a “non-conference contract” shall be made by the contracting officer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for the Privacy Act.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The contracting officer shall review all acquisition request documentation to determine whether the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) are applicable. The Privacy Act requirements apply when a contract or order requires the contractor to design, develop, or operate any Privacy Act system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function. When applicable, the contracting officer shall include the two Privacy Act clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 24.104 in the solicitation and contract or order. In addition, the contracting officer shall include the two FAR Privacy Act clauses, and other pertinent information specified in this subpart, in any modification which results in the Privacy Act requirements becoming applicable to a contract or order.</P>
              <P>(b) The contracting officer shall ensure that the statement of work or performance work statement (SOW or PWS) specifies the system(s) of records or proposed system(s) of records to which the Privacy Act and the implementing regulations are applicable or may be applicable. The contracting officer shall send the contractor a copy of 45 CFR part 5b, which includes the rules of conduct and other Privacy Act requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) The contracting officer shall ensure that the contract SOW or PWS specifies for both the Privacy Act and the Federal Records Act the disposition to be made of the system(s) of records upon completion of contract performance. The contract SOW or PWS may require the contractor to destroy the records, remove personal identifiers, or turn the records over to the contracting officer. If there is a legitimate need for a contractor to keep copies of the records after completion of a contract, the contractor must take measures, as approved by the contracting officer, to keep the records confidential and protect the individuals' privacy.</P>

              <P>(d) For any acquisition subject to Privacy Act requirements, the requiring activity prior to award shall prepare and have published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a “system notice,” describing the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) intent to establish a new system of records on individuals, to make modifications to an existing system, or to disclose information in regard to an existing system. The requiring activity shall attach a copy of the system notice to the acquisition plan or other acquisition request documentation. If a system notice is not attached, the contracting officer shall inquire about its status and shall obtain a copy from the requiring activity for inclusion in the contract file. If a notice for the system of records has not been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the contracting officer may proceed with the acquisition but shall not award the contract until the system notice is published and the contracting officer verifies its publication.</P>

The clause also requires the contractor to ensure each of its employees knows the prescribed rules of conduct in 45 CFR part 5b and each contractor employee is aware that he or she is subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act. These requirements also apply to all subcontracts awarded under the contract or order that require the design, development, or operation of a system of records.</P>

              <P>(a) HHS is a HIPAA “covered entity” that is a “hybrid entity” as these terms are defined at sections 160.103 and 164.103 respectively. As such, only the portions of HHS that the Secretary has designated as “health care components” (HCC) as defined at section 164.103, are subject to HIPAA. HHS' HCCs may utilize persons or entities known as “business associates,” as defined at section 160.103. Generally, “business associate” means a “person” as defined by section 160.103 (including contractors, and third-party vendors, etc.) if or when the person or entity:</P>
              <P>(1) Creates, receives, maintains, or transmits “protected health information”, as the term is defined at section 160.103, on behalf of an HHS HCC to carry out HHS HIPAA “covered functions” as that term is defined at 164.103; or</P>
              <P>(2) Provides certain services to an HHS HCC that involve PHI.</P>
              <P>(b) Where the Department as a covered entity is required by 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1) and 164.504(e) and, if applicable, sections 164.308(b)(3) and 164.314(a), to enter into a HIPAA business associate contract, the relevant HCC contracting officer, acting on behalf of the Department, shall ensure that such contract meets the requirements at section 164.504(e)(2) and, if applicable, section 164.314(a)(2).</P>

Supplemental preference requirements shall represent a further implementation of the requirements of section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 and require the approval of the affected program director and the appropriate legal office, or a regional attorney, before the contracting officer adds them to a solicitation and resultant contract. Any supplemental preference requirements the contracting officer adds to the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program shall also clearly <PRTPAGE P="27"/>identify in the solicitation the additional requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) Nothing in this part shall preclude tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own tribal preference requirements. Such independently-developed tribal preference requirements shall not, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, become a requirement in contracts covered under this subpart, and shall not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement concerning the award and administration of contracts.</P>

              <P>The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.226-1, Indian Preference, and the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program, in contracts to implement section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 for all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) activities.

              <P>(a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.226-1, Indian Preference, in solicitations, contracts, and orders when—</P>
              <P>(1) The award is (or will be) pursuant to an act specifically authorizing such awards with Indian organizations; or</P>
              <P>(2) The work is specifically for the benefit of Indians and is in addition to any incidental benefits which might otherwise accrue to the general public.</P>
              <P>(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.226-2, Indian Preference Program, in solicitations, contracts, and orders when—</P>
              <P>(1) The dollar amount of the acquisition is expected to equal or exceed $650,000 for non-construction work or $1.5 million for construction work;</P>
              <P>(2) The solicitation, contract, or order includes the Indian Preference clause; and</P>
              <P>(3) The contracting officer makes the determination, prior to solicitation, that performance will take place in whole or in substantial part on or near an Indian reservation(s). In addition, the contracting officer may insert the Indian Preference Program clause in solicitations, contracts, and orders below the $650,000 or $1.5 million level for non-construction or construction contracts, respectively, but which meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, and in the opinion of the contracting officer, offer substantial opportunities for Indian employment, training, and subcontracting.</P>

              <SECTNO>326.600</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Scope of subpart.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This subpart sets forth the policy on preferential acquisition from Indians under the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act. This subpart applies only to acquisitions made by or on behalf of Indian Health Service (IHS).</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>326.601</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) IHS shall utilize the negotiation authority of the Buy Indian Act to give preference to Indians whenever authorized and practicable. The Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, prescribes the application of the advertising requirements of 41 U.S.C. 6101 to the acquisition of Indian supplies. As specified in 25 U.S.C. 47, the Buy Indian Act provides that, so far as practicable, the Government shall employ Indian labor and, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior, purchase products of Indian industry (including, but not limited to printing, notwithstanding any other law) from the open market.</P>
              <P>(b) Due to the transfer of authority from the Department of the Interior to HHS, the Secretary of HHS may use the Buy Indian Act to acquire products of Indian industry in connection with the maintenance and operation of Indian hospital and health facilities, and for the overall conservation of Indian health. This authority is exclusively delegated to IHS and is not available for use by any other HHS component (unless that component makes an acquisition on behalf of IHS). However, the Buy Indian Act itself does not exempt IHS from meeting the statutorily mandated small business goals.</P>
              <P>(c) Subsequent legislation, particularly Public Law 94-437 and Public Law 96-537, emphasize using the Buy Indian Act negotiation authority.</P>

For this purpose, contract work does not include the provision of materials, supplies, or equipment.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Wage rates.</E> The contracting officer shall include a determination of the minimum wage rates by the Secretary of Labor as required by the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a) in all contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act for over $2,000 for construction, alteration, or repair, including painting and decorating, of public buildings and public works, except contracts with Indian tribes or public nonprofit organizations serving as governmental instrumentalities of an Indian tribe.<PRTPAGE P="29"/>

            <P>(a) Contracting activities should encourage contractors to contribute to the cost of performing research and development (R&amp;D), through the use of cost-sharing contracts, where there is a probability that the contractor will receive present or future benefits from participation as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.303. <PRTPAGE P="35"/>Examples include increased technical know-how, training for employees, acquisition of goods or services, development of a commercially viable product that can be sold in the commercial market and use of background knowledge in future contracts. Cost-sharing is intended to serve the mutual interests of the Government and its contractors by helping to ensure efficient utilization of the resources available for the conduct of R&amp;D projects and by promoting sound planning and prudent fiscal policies of the contractor. The Government's interest includes positive impact on the community at large.</P>
            <P>(b) The contracting officer should use a cost-sharing contract for R&amp;D contracts, unless the contracting officer determines that a request for cost-sharing would not be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) Any determination made by a contracting officer as described in this section shall be evidenced by appropriate documentation in the contract file.</P>

            <SECTNO>335.070-2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Amount of cost-sharing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>When cost-sharing is appropriate, the contracting officer shall use the following guidelines to determine the amount of cost participation by the contractor:</P>
            <P>(a) The amount of cost participation depends on the extent to which the R&amp;D effort or results are likely to enhance the contractor's capability, expertise, or competitive position, and the value of this enhancement to the contractor. Therefore, contractor cost participation could reasonably range from as little as one percent or less of the total project cost to more than 50 percent of the total project cost. Ultimately, cost-sharing is a negotiable item. As such, the amount of cost-sharing shall be proportional to the anticipated value of the contractor's gain.</P>
            <P>(b) If the contractor will not acquire title to, or the right to use, inventions, patents, or technical information resulting from the R&amp;D project, it is normally appropriate to obtain less cost-sharing than in cases in which the contractor acquires these rights.</P>
            <P>(c) If the R&amp;D is expected to be of only minor value to the contractor, and if a statute does not require cost-sharing, it may be appropriate for the contractor to make a contribution in the form of a reduced fee or profit rather than sharing costs of the project. Alternatively, a limitation on indirect cost rates might be appropriate. See FAR 42.707. See also, FAR 16.303.</P>
            <P>(d) The contractor's participation may be considered over the total term of the project, so that a relatively high contribution in 1 year may be offset by a relatively low contribution in another. Care must be exercised that the intent to cost-share in future years does not become illusory. Redetermination of the cost sharing arrangement might be appropriate depending on future circumstances.</P>
            <P>(e) A relatively low degree of cost-sharing may be appropriate if an area of R&amp;D requires special stimulus in the national interest.</P>

            <SECTNO>335.070-3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Method of cost-sharing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Cost-sharing on individual contracts may be accomplished either by a contribution of part or all of one or more elements of allowable cost of the work being performed or by a fixed amount or stated percentage of the total allowable costs of the project. Contractors shall not charge costs contributed to the Government under any other instrument (e.g., grant or contract), including allocations to other instruments as part of any independent R&amp;D program.</P>

            <P>If the contracting officer determines that the personnel to be assigned to perform effort on an R&amp;D contract are critical to the success of the R&amp;D effort, or were a critical factor in the award of the contract, then the contracting officer should consider using the key personnel clause at 352.237-75, Key Personnel.</P>

This summary shall be submitted for review by the Section 508 Official or designee. The Section 508 Official or designee shall indicate approval or disapproval of the SSET assessment. The contracting officer shall coordinate the resolution of any issues raised by the Section 508 Official or designee with the chair of the SSET or requiring activity representative, as appropriate.

              <P>(1) Documented and certified in accordance with the requirements of the HHS Section 508 policy;</P>
              <P>(2) Signed by the requestor in the requiring activity;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Section 508 accessibility standards for contracts.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794(d)), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (Section 508), specifies the applicable accessibility standards for all new solicitations and new or existing contracts or orders, regardless of EIT dollar amount.</P>
              <P>(b) The requiring activity shall consult with the OPDIV or STAFFDIV Section 508 Official or designee, as necessary, to determine the applicability of Section 508, identify applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and resolve any related issues before forwarding a request to the contracting or procurement office for the acquisition of EIT supplies and services—including Web site content and communications material for which the contractor must meet EIT accessibility standards.</P>
              <P>(c) Based on those discussions, the requiring activity shall provide a statement in the AP (or other acquisition request document) for Section 508 applicability. See 307.105. If Section 508 applies to an acquisition, include the provision at 352.239-73, Electronic and Information Technology and Accessibility Notice, language in a separate, clearly designated, section of the statement of work or performance work statement, along with any additional information applicable to the acquisition's Section 508 accessibility standards (e.g., the list of applicable accessibility standards of the Access Board EIT Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194)). If an AP does not address Section 508 applicability and it appears an acquisition involves Section 508, or if the discussion of Section 508 applicability to the acquisition is inadequate or incomplete, the contracting officer shall request the requiring activity modify the AP accordingly.</P>
              <P>(d) Items provided incidental to contract administration are not subject to this section.</P>
              <P>(e) The OPDIV Section 508 Official or designee may, at his or her discretion, require review and approval of solicitations and contracts for EIT supplies and services.</P>

If, after soliciting bids or proposals from Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, the Contractor receives no responsive bid or acceptable proposal, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the “Indian Preference” clause of this contract. If the Contractor receives one or more responsive bids or conforming proposals, the Contractor shall award the contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder or conforming offer from a responsible offeror if the price is reasonable. If the Contractor determines the low responsive bid or conforming proposal's price is unreasonable, the Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable price and award a subcontract.

                <P>(iii) Class 3 Subject Inventions shall be governed by FAR clause 52.227-11, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Contractor (December 2007) (previously incorporated herein by reference).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Greater Rights Determinations.</E> The Contractor, or an employee-inventor after consultation by the Agency with the Contractor, may request greater rights than are provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause in accordance with the procedures of FAR paragraph 27.304-1(c). In addition to the considerations set forth in paragraph 27.304-1(c), the Agency may consider whether granting the requested greater rights will interfere with rights of the Government or any Third party assignee or otherwise impede the ability of the Government or the Third party assignee to, for example, develop and commercialize new compounds, dosage forms, therapies, preventative measures, technologies, or other approaches with potential for the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of human diseases.</P>
                <P>A request for a determination of whether the Contractor or the employee-inventor is entitled to retain such greater rights must be submitted to the Agency Contracting Officer at the time of the first disclosure of the invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or not later than 8 months thereafter, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. Each determination of greater rights under this contract shall be subject to paragraph (c) of the FAR clause at 52.227-13 (incorporated herein by reference), and to any reservations and conditions deemed to be appropriate by the Agency such as the requirement to assign or exclusively license the rights to Subject Inventions to the Third party assignee.</P>
                <P>A determination by the Agency denying a request by the Contractor for greater rights in a Subject Invention may be appealed within 30 days of the date the Contractor is notified of the determination to an Agency official at a level above the individual who made the determination. If greater rights are granted, the Contractor must file a patent application on the invention. Upon request, the Contractor shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if filed in a language other than English), and patent number and issue date for any Subject Invention in any country for which the Contractor has retained title. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application file.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Invention disclosure by Contractor.</E> The Contractor shall disclose in writing each Subject Invention to the Agency Contracting Officer and to the Director, Division of Extramural Inventions and Technology Resources (DEITR), if directed by the Contracting Officer, as provided in paragraph (j) of this clause within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the Agency Contracting Officer shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was Made and all inventors. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the <PRTPAGE P="51"/>extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale (offer for sale), or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication, and if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure.</P>
                <P>In addition, after disclosure to the Agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the Contracting Officer and DEITR of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor. If the Contractor assigns a Subject Invention to the Third party assignee, then the Contractor and its employee inventors shall assist the Third party assignee in securing patent protection. All costs of securing the patent, including the cost of the Contractor's assistance, are at the Third party's expense. Any assistance provided by the Contractor and its employee inventors to the Third party assignee or other costs incurred in securing patent protection shall be solely at the Third party's expense and not billable to the contract.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Contractor action to protect the Third party assignee's and the Government's interest.</E> (1) The Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to the Agency all instruments necessary to: Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in Subject Inventions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this clause; convey title to a Third party assignee in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause; and enable the Third party assignee to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that Subject Invention.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each Subject Invention “Made” under contract in order that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on Subject Inventions and to establish the Government's rights or a Third party assignee's rights in the Subject Inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</P>
                <P>(3) If the Contractor is granted greater rights, the Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of any United States non-provisional patent application it files, and any patent issuing thereon, covering a Subject Invention the following statement: “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the Contract) awarded by (identify the specific Agency). The Government has certain rights in the invention.”</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor agrees to provide a final invention statement and certification prior to the closeout of the contract listing all Subject Inventions or stating that there were none.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Subcontracts.</E> (1) The Contractor will include this clause in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work. At all tiers, the clause must be modified to identify the parties as follows: References to the Government are not changed, and the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause. The Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the contract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's Subject Inventions.</P>
                <P>(2) In subcontracts, at any tier, the Agency, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Agency with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of FAR clause 52.227-13.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Reporting on utilization of Subject Inventions in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor.</E> The Contractor agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a Subject Invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its licensees or assignees when a request under subparagraph b.3. has been granted by the Agency. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and information as the Agency may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the Agency in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the Agency in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the Agency agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Contractor.</P>

                <P>(g) Preference for United States industry in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor. Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees <PRTPAGE P="52"/>that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any Subject Invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any product embodying the Subject Invention or produced through the use of the Subject Invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by the Agency upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">March-in rights in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor.</E> The Contractor acknowledges that, with respect to any Subject Invention in which it has acquired ownership through the exercise of the rights specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause, the Agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), and in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of Agency in effect on the date of contract award.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations in the event greater rights are granted to the Contractor.</E> If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it shall:</P>
                <P>(1) Not assign rights to a Subject Invention in the United States without the written approval of the Agency, except where an assignment is made to an organization that has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided that the assignee shall be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;</P>
                <P>(2) Share royalties collected on a Subject Invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (but through their Agency if the Agency deems it appropriate) when the Subject Invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;</P>
                <P>(3) Use the balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor with respect to Subject Inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of Subject Inventions for the support of scientific research or education;</P>
                <P>(4) Make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of Subject Inventions that are small business concerns, and give a preference to a small business concern when licensing a Subject Invention if the Contractor determines that the small business concern has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business concerns; provided, that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business concern has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Contractor; and</P>
                <P>(5) Allow the Secretary of Commerce to review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Communications.</E> All invention disclosures and requests for greater rights shall be sent to the Agency Contracting Officer, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Additionally, a copy of all disclosures, confirmatory licenses to the Government, face page of the patent applications, waivers and other routine communications under this funding agreement at all tiers must be sent to:</P>

If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the Head of the Contracting Activity, that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer will furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final Agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's decision. The Government will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination becoming final (in which instance the Government will thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.</P>
                <P>(2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with Agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request there under.</P>

                <P>(b) For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms “direct salary,” “salary,” and “institutional base salary,” have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as “direct salary,” in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Notice (DEC 2015)</HD>
                <P>(a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.</P>

                <P>(b) Accordingly, any offeror responding to this solicitation must comply with established HHS EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/web/508</E>.

                <P>(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are stated in <PRTPAGE P="63"/>the clause at 352.239-74, Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility.</P>

                <P>In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT supplies meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must submit an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining whether proposed EIT supplies conform to applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows offerors or developers to self-evaluate their supplies and document—in detail—whether they conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard, and any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template are available under Section 508 policy on the HHS Web site <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/web/508</E>.</P>
                <P>In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must provide enough information to assist the Government in determining that the EIT services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards, including any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues.</P>

                <P>(d) Respondents to this solicitation must identify any exception to Section 508 requirements. If a offeror claims its supplies or services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and it is later determined by the Government, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> after award of a contract or order, that supplies or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notice to Offerors, Protection of Human Subjects (DEC 2015)</HD>

                <P>(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects, 45 CFR part 46, are available on the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) Web site at: <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/index.html</E>.</P>
                <P>These regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of human subjects participating in research activities supported or conducted by HHS.</P>
                <P>(b) The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data or identifiable public information through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. In most cases, the regulations extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human subjects. 45 CFR part 46 does not directly regulate the use of autopsy materials; instead, applicable state and local laws govern their use.</P>

                <P>(c) Activities which involve human subjects in one or more of the categories set forth in 45 CFR 46.101(b)(1)-(6) are exempt from complying with 45 CFR part 46. See <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html</E>.</P>
                <P>(d) Inappropriate designations of the noninvolvement of human subjects or of exempt categories of research in a project may result in delays in the review of a proposal.</P>

                <P>(e) In accordance with 45 CFR part 46, offerors considered for award shall file an acceptable Federal-wide Assurance (FWA) of compliance with OHRP specifying review procedures and assigning responsibilities for the protection of human subjects. The FWA is the only type of assurance that OHRP accepts or approves. The initial and continuing review of a research project by an institutional review board shall ensure that: The risks to subjects are minimized; risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result; selection of subjects is equitable; and informed consent will be obtained and documented by methods that are adequate and appropriate. Depending on the nature of the research, additional requirements may apply; see <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.111</E> for additional requirements regarding initial and continuing review. HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR part 46), information regarding OHRP registration and assurance requirements/processes, and OHRP contact information is available at the OHRP Web site (at <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/index.html</E>).</P>
                <P>(f) Offerors may consult with OHRP only for general advice or guidance concerning either regulatory requirements or ethical issues pertaining to research involving human subjects. ONLY the contracting officer may offer information concerning a solicitation.</P>
                <P>(g) The offeror shall document in its proposal the approved FWA from OHRP, related to the designated Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewing and overseeing the research. If the offeror does not have an approved FWA from OHRP, the offeror must obtain an FWA before the deadline for proposal submission. When possible, the offeror shall also certify the IRB's review and approval of the research. If the offeror cannot obtain this certification by the time of proposal submission they must include an explanation in their proposal. Never conduct research covered by 45 CFR part 46 prior to receiving certification of the research's review and approval by the IRB.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice to Offerors—Protection of Human Subjects, Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) Approval of Research Protocols Required.</SUBJECT>
              <P>As prescribed in HHSAR 370.303(d), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following provision:</P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notice to Offerors—Protection of Human Subjects, Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) Approval of Research Protocols Required (DEC 2015)</HD>
                <P>(a) All Offerors proposing research expected to involve human subjects shall comply with the regulations set forth in 45 CFR part 46, and with the provisions at HHSAR 352.270-4a.</P>
                <P>(b) The Offeror shall have an acceptable Assurance of Compliance on file with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), whenever it submits a proposal to the FDA for research expected to involve human subjects. Direct questions regarding Federal-wide Assurance to OHRP. The Offeror's proposal shall include a copy of the acceptable Assurance of Compliance.</P>
                <P>(c) After the contract has been awarded, the Contractor shall take the following actions:</P>
                <P>(1) The Institutional Review Board (IRB) specified in the Offeror's Assurance of Compliance, hereafter referred to as “the local IRB,” shall review the proposed research protocol. A letter from the local IRB stating that the proposed research protocol has been reviewed and approved, and thus adequately protects the rights and welfare of human subjects involved, or a letter stating that the proposed research is exempt under 45 CFR 46.101(b) shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(2) Upon award, the successful Offeror, hereafter “the Contractor,” shall submit its proposed research protocol to the FDA's Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC). The RIHSC or its designee will review and approve the research protocol to assure it adequately protects the rights and welfare of human subjects involved. The RIHSC or designee will also determine whether the proposed research is exempt under 45 CFR 46.101(b). The Contractor shall submit, to the Contracting Officer of record, a copy of the RIHSC's or its designee's letter stating that it reviewed and approved the proposed research protocol.</P>

                <P>(d) The Contractor shall not advertise for, recruit, or enroll human subjects, or otherwise commence any research involving human subjects until RIHSC or its designee reviews and approves its research. The Contractor may begin other limited aspects of contract performance prior to receiving RIHSC's or designee's approval of the proposed research protocol. Research involving human subjects may commence immediately upon the Contractor's receipt of RIHSC's or designee's approval; however, the Contractor shall submit a copy of RIHSC's or its designee's approval to the Contracting Officer within three business days of its receipt.<PRTPAGE P="68"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) A Contractor's failure to obtain RIHSC's or its designee's approval of its proposed research may result in termination of its contract. However, failure to obtain RIHSC's or its designee's approval during initial review will not automatically result in termination of the contract. Instead, the Contractor may correct any deficiencies identified during the initial RIHSC or designee review and resubmit the proposed research protocol to RIHSC or its designee for a second review. The Contractor is encouraged to solicit the RIHSC's or its designee's input during the resubmission process.</P>
                <P>(f) The Contractor shall seek RIHSC's or its designee's and local IRB review and approval whenever making modifications, amendments or other changes to the research protocol. Such modifications, amendments and changes include, but are not limited to changes in investigators, informed consent forms, and recruitment advertisements. The Contractor may institute changes immediately after receiving both the local IRB and RIHSC or its designee approval (except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject); however, the Contractor shall submit a copy of the letter evidencing RIHSC's or its designee's approval of the proposed changes to the Contracting Officer within three business days of its receipt.</P>

              <P>It is the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) policy that the contracting officer shall not award a contract involving human subjects until the prospective contractor provides assurance that the activity will undergo initial and continuing review by an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103. The contracting officer shall require a Federal-wide assurance (FWA), approved by the HHS Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), of each contractor, subcontractor, or institution engaged in human subjects research in performance of a contract. OHRP administers the assurance covering all HHS-supported or HHS-conducted activities involving human subjects.</P>

              <P>(a) OHRP-Approved FWAs are found at the following Web site: <E T="03">http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/search.aspx?styp=bsc</E>.</P>
              <P>(b) Normally a contractor, subcontractor, or institution must provide approval of a FWA before a contract is awarded. If a contractor, subcontractor, or institution does not currently hold an approved FWA, it shall submit an explanation with its proposal and an FWA application prior to submitting a proposal. The contracting officer, on a case by case basis, may make award without an approved assurance in consultation with OHRP.</P>

              <P>(c) A contractor, subcontractor, or institution must submit all FWAs, including new FWAs, using the electronic submission system available through the OHRP Web site at <E T="03">http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile/</E>, unless an institution lacks the ability to do so electronically. If an institution believes it lacks the ability to submit its FWA electronically, it must contact OHRP by telephone or email (see <E T="03">http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/index.html</E>) and explain why it is unable to submit its FWA electronically.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice to offerors.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-4a, Notice to Offerors, Protection of Human Subjects, in solicitations that involve human subjects. The contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I when the agency is prescribing a date later than the proposal submission by which the offeror must have an approved FWA.<PRTPAGE P="71"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Institutions having an OHRP-approved FWA shall certify IRB approval of submitted proposals in the manner required by instructions for completion of the contract proposal; by completion of an OMB Form No. 0990-0263, Protection of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB Certification/Declaration of Exemption (Common Rule); or by letter indicating the institution's OHRP-assigned FWA number, the date of IRB review and approval, and the type of review (convened or expedited). The date of IRB approval must not be more than 12 months prior to the deadline for proposal submission.</P>
              <P>(c) The contracting officer generally will not request FWAs for contractors, subcontractors, or institutions prior to selecting a contract proposal for negotiation. When a contractor submits an FWA, it provides certification for the initial contract period; no additional documentation is required. If the contract provides for additional years to complete the project, the contractor shall certify annually in the manner described in 370.303(b).</P>
              <P>(d) For the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the contracting officer shall insert the provision at 352.270-10, Notice to Offerors—Protection of Human Subjects, Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) Approval of Research Protocols Required, in solicitations that involve human subjects when the research is subject to RIHSC review and approval.</P>

              <P>(b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-6, Restriction on Use of Human Subjects, in contracts and orders if the contractor has an approved FWA of compliance in place, but cannot certify prior to award that an IRB registered with OHRP reviewed and approved the research, because definite plans for involvement of human subjects are not set forth in the proposal (e.g., projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds). Under these conditions, the contracting officer may make the award without the requisite certification, as long as the contracting officer includes appropriate conditions in the contract or order.</P>
              <P>(c) For FDA, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 352.270-11, Protection of Human Subjects, Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC) Approval of Research Protocols Required, in contracts and orders that involve human subjects when the research is subject to RIHSC review and approval.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) It is HHS policy that contracting activities shall not award a contract involving live vertebrate animals until the Contractor provides acceptable assurance the contract work is subject to initial and continuing review by an appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) as described in the PHS Policy at IV.B.6 and 7. The contracting officer shall require an applicable Animal Welfare Assurance approved by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of each contractor, subcontractor, or institution having responsibility for animal care <PRTPAGE P="72"/>and use involved in performance of the contract. Normally the assurance shall be approved before award. The contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, may make award without an approved assurance in consultation with OLAW. For additional information see PHS Policy II., IV.A, and V.B.</P>
              <P>(b) The OLAW, NIH, is responsible for negotiating assurances covering all HHS/PHS-supported or HHS/PHS-conducted activities involving the care and use of live vertebrate animals. OLAW shall provide guidance to contracting officers regarding adequate animal care and use, approval, disapproval, restriction, or withdrawal of approval of assurances. For additional information see PHS Policy V.A.</P>

              <P>(c) If using live vertebrate animals, HHS policy requires that offerors address the points in the Vertebrate Animal Section (VAS) of the Technical Proposal. Each of the points must be addressed in the VAS portion of the Technical Proposal. For additional information see PHS Policy and use Contract Proposal VAS Worksheet. <E T="03">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm# InformationRequiredinApplications- ProposalsforAwardsSubmittedtoPHS</E> and <E T="03">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/VAScontracts.pdf</E>.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Assurances.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Animal Welfare Assurances may be one of three types:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Domestic Assurance (DA).</E> A DA describes the institution's animal care and use program, including but not limited to the lines of authority and responsibility, veterinary care, IACUC composition and procedures, occupational health and safety, training, facilities, and species housed. A DA listed in OLAW's list of institutions with an approved DA is acceptable for purposes of this policy.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inter-institutional Assurance (IA).</E> The offeror, its proposed subcontractor, or institution shall submit an IA when it does not have a proprietary animal care and use program, facilities to house animals or IACUC, and does not conduct animal research on-site. The offeror will perform the animal activity at an institution with an Animal Welfare Assurance named as a performance site. An IA approval extends to the full period of contract performance (up to 5 years) limited to the specific award or single project.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Foreign Assurance (FA).</E> The Foreign Assurance is required for institutions outside the U.S. that receive PHS funds directly through a contract award. The Foreign Assurance also applies to institutions outside the U.S. that receive PHS funds indirectly (named as a performance site).

              <P>(a) The AGAR is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as Chapter 4 of Title 48, Federal Acquisition Regulations System, to implement and supplement Chapter 1 which constitutes the FAR. Parts 400 through 499 have been assigned to USDA by the Office of the Federal Register.<PRTPAGE P="78"/>

              <P>(b) The AGAR and its subsequent changes are published in:</P>

              <P>(2) Cumulative form in the CFR, and,</P>
              <P>(3) Electronic form on the USDA Departmental Administration Procurement Homepage (see 401.170).</P>

              <P>(c) Section 553(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, provides an exception from the standard public rulemaking procedures to the extent that the rule involves a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. In 1971, Secretary of Agriculture Hardin announced a voluntary partial waiver from the Administrative Procedure Act exception, and USDA agencies generally are required to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment on proposed rules (36 FR 13804, July 24, 1971). The AGAR has been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance with the rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. The USDA also is required to publish for public comment procurement regulations in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 418b), and FAR 1.301.</P>

Written applications for registration may be submitted to Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration, 74 Washington Ave., Suite 7, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084.</P>

              <P>(b) Verification that the prospective contractor is registered in the CCR database shall be done via the CCR Internet Web site <E T="03">http://www.ccr.gov.</E> This verification process using the CCR Web site applies both to acquisitions executed using USDA legacy procurement systems and the USDA Integrated Acquisition System.</P>
              <P>(c) AGAR Advisories issued by the Office of Procurement and Property Management will address internal procedures for integration of contractor information in the CCR database with the USDA FFIS payment system.</P>

                <P>1. To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest exists that may diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and objective review of the offeror's proposal, or may otherwise result in a biased opinion or an unfair advantage. If a potential conflict of interest arises or if I identify such a conflict, I agree to notify the Government promptly concerning the potential conflict. In determining whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I agree to review whether my or my employer's relationships with other persons or entities, including, but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds, other outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment arrangements (past, present, or under consideration), and, to the extent known by me, all financial interests and employment arrangements of my spouse, minor children, and other members of my immediate household, may place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the evaluation proceedings.</P>

                <P>2. I agree to use proposal information only for evaluation purposes. I understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed upon the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor or by the Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted information of the proposal. I agree to use my best effort to safeguard such information physically, and not to disclose the contents of, or release any information relating to, the proposal(s) to anyone outside of the Source Evaluation Board or other <PRTPAGE P="97"/>panel assembled for this acquisition, the Contracting Officer, or other individuals designated by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>3. I agree to return to the Government all copies of proposals, as well as any abstracts, upon completion of the evaluation.</P>

Any authorized restrictive notices which the submitter places on this proposal shall be strictly complied with.

              <P>It is the policy of USDA to acquire and use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated recycled content products.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Agency affirmative procurement programs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The USDA affirmative procurement program (APP) policy applicable to all USDA agencies and staff offices is hereby established. The components of this APP include:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recovered Materials Preference Program.</E> In accord with the requirements of Section 402(c) of Executive Order 13101, Greening the Government Through Recycling, Waste Prevention, and Federal Acquisition, USDA agencies will include, in all applicable solicitations and contracts, a preference for products and services which meet or exceed the EPA purchasing guidelines as contained in the EPA product Recovered Materials Advisory Notices (RMANs). Agencies may choose an evaluation factor preference, or other method of indicating preference in accord with their agency needs. Agencies will, as appropriate, eliminate virgin material requirements in contract specifications and replace them with a statement of preference for recycled materials.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Promotion program.</E> USDA agencies will actively promote a preference for recovered materials, environmentally preferable products, and biobased products in contacts with vendors, in written materials, and other appropriate opportunities.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reasonable estimation of recovered materials used in the performance of contracts.</E> USDA agencies annually will provide in writing to the USDA Senior Procurement Executive, in response to a call for data for the Resource Conservation and Recovery report, reasonable estimates, certification, and verification of recovered material used in the performance of contracts.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Annual review and monitoring of effectiveness of the program.</E> USDA agencies will provide an annual assessment of the effectiveness of their affirmative <PRTPAGE P="105"/>procurement program actions in increasing the purchase and use of EPA designated products.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Purchase of EPA designated products.</E> USDA agencies will require that 100% of purchases of EPA-designated products contain recovered material, unless the item cannot be acquired—</P>
              <P>(1) Competitively within a reasonable time frame;</P>
              <P>(2) Meeting appropriate performance standards; or</P>
              <P>(3) At a reasonable price.</P>
              <P>(f) The 100% purchase requirement of paragraph (e) of this section applies to all USDA agency purchases, including those at or below the micro-purchase threshold.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>423.405</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The threshold of purchase for EPA designated items is $10,000 per year at the USDA departmental, not individual agency, level. Therefore, the APP requirements above, including the 100% purchase requirement, apply at the individual agency and staff office level.</P>

              <P>(b) Contracting officers should refer to EPA's list of designated products and products identified as recycled content when purchasing supplies or services. Information on EPA designated products is available at: <E T="03">www.epa.gov/cpg/products.htm.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) All agencies and USDA Contracting Officers must take necessary actions to carry out the provisions of the USDA APP policy described in this subpart.</P>

              <P>(b) The recommendation shall be submitted through the HCA to the SPE and shall include a full description of the disruption of USDA operations should the determination not be waived.</P>

              <P>Progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion are authorized for use as a payment method under USDA contracts or subcontracts for construction, alteration or repair, and shipbuilding and conversion. Such payments also are authorized for service contracts, if the contracting officer determines that progress payments based on costs are not practicable and adequate safeguards are provided to administer progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion. For all other contracts, progress payment provisions shall be based on costs except that the HCA may authorize progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion on a case-by-case basis. Each authorization by the HCA shall include a determination and finding that progress payments based on costs cannot be employed practically and that there are adequate safeguards provided for the administration of progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion.</P>

              <P>(d) When the contractor, under a fixed-price construction contract, furnishes evidence to the contracting officer that the surety has been paid in full for bond premiums and requests reimbursement, the first subsequent progress payment shall include the total amount attributable to such bond premiums and the Government shall pay that amount in full. This amount paid for the bond premiums is not an amount in addition to the stated contract price.</P>

                <P>(a) If items called for by this solicitation have been identified by a “brand name or equal” description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Offers of “equal” products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the offer (see clause 452.211-71) and are determined by the Contracting Officer to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the solicitation.</P>

The evaluation of offers and the determination as to the equality of the product(s) offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the offeror or identified in its offer as well as other information reasonably available to the contracting activity. Caution to offerors: The contracting activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer and is not reasonably available to the contracting activity. Accordingly, to assure that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a part of its offer all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting activity to (i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the solicitation, and (ii) establish exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific reference to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting activity.</P>
                <P>(2) If an offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the solicitation, the offer shall include (i) a clear description of such proposed modifications and (ii) clearly marked descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.</P>

                <P>(2) Offerors may, at their discretion, submit alternate proposals or proposals which deviate from the requirement; provided, that an offeror also submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the statement of work. Any “alternate” proposal may be considered if overall performance would be improved or not compromised, and if it is in the best interest of the Government. Alternate proposals, or deviations from any requirement of this RFP, must be clearly identified.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical Proposal Instructions.</E> The technical proposal will be used to make an evaluation and arrive at a determination as to whether the proposal will meet the requirements of the Government. Therefore, the technical proposal must present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the requirements and a detailed, description of the techniques, procedures and program for achieving the objectives of the specifications/statement of work. Proposals which merely paraphrase the requirements of the Government's specifications/ statement of work, or use such phrases as “will comply” or “standard techniques will be employed” will be considered unacceptable and will not be considered further. As a minimum, the proposal must clearly provide the following:</P>

In any case all bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same additive or deductive bid items, determined as above provided. The listed order of priority need be followed only for determining the low bidder. After determination of the low bidder as stated, award in the best interests of the Government may be made on the selected first or base bid item and any combination of additive or deductive items for which funds are determined to be available at the time of the award, provided that award on such combination of bid items does not exceed the amount offered by any other conforming responsible bidder for the same combination of bid items.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Fire Suppression Costs.</E> The Contractor's obligations for cost of fire suppression vary according to three classifications of fires as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Operations Fire.</E> An “operations fire” is a fire caused by the Contractor's operations other than a negligent fire. The Contractor agrees to reimburse Forest Service for such cost for each operations fire, subject to a <PRTPAGE P="135"/>maximum dollar amount of [<E T="03">Contracting Officer insert amount</E>]. The cost of the Contractor's actions, supplies, and equipment on any such fire, or otherwise provided at the request of Forest Service, shall be credited toward such maximum.

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Negligent Fire.</E> A “negligent fire” is a fire caused by the negligence or fault of the Contractor's operations including, but not limited to, one caused by smoking by persons engaged in the Contractor's operations during the course of their employment, or during rest or lunch periods; or if the Contractor's failure to comply with requirements under this contract results in a fire starting, or permits a fire to spread. Damages and the cost of suppressing negligent fires shall be borne by the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Other Fires on Contract Area.</E> Forest Service shall pay the Contractor, at firefighting rates common in the area or at prior agreed rates, for equipment or personnel furnished by the Contractor at the request of Forest Service, on any fire on contract area other than an operations fire or a negligent fire.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Contractor's Responsibility for Notification in Case of Fire.</E> The Contractor shall immediately notify the Government of any fires sighted on or in the vicinity of the work site.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Contractor's Responsibility for Responding to Emergencies.</E> When directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall temporarily redirect employees and equipment from the work site for emergency work (anticipated to be restricted to firefighting). This is considered to be within the general scope of the contract. An equitable adjustment for any such redirection of employees and equipment will be made under the FAR clause at 52.243-4, Changes.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Performance by the Contractor.</E> Where the Contractor's employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors, or their employees or agents perform the Contractor's operations in connection with fire responsibilities, the Contractor's obligations shall be the same as if performance was by Contractor.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">State Law.</E> The Contractor shall not be relieved by the terms of this contract of any liability to the United States for fire suppression costs recovered in an action based on State law, except for such costs resulting from operations fires. Amounts due to the Contractor for firefighting expenditures on operations fires shall not be withheld pending settlement of any such claim or action based on State law.</P>

A product shall not be considered to be a product of the United States if it contains any ingredient that is not produced in the United States if that ingredient is:</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Lowest landed cost and delivery considerations.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, in contracts for the Foreign Agricultural Service for commodities and related freight shipment for delivery to foreign destinations, the contracting officer shall consider the lowest landed cost of delivering the commodity to the intended destination. This lowest landed cost determination will be calculated on the basis of rates and service for that portion of the commodities being purchased that is determined is necessary and practicable to meet 46 U.S.C. 55314(c)(3) and cargo preference requirements and on an overall (foreign and U.S. flag) basis for the remaining portion of the commodities being procured and the additional factors set forth in this section. Accordingly, the solicitations issued with respect to a commodity procurement or a related freight procurement will specify that in the event an offer submitted by a party is the lowest offered price, the contracting officer reserves the right to reject such offer if the acceptance of another offer for the commodity or related freight, when combined with other offers for commodities or related freight, results in a lower landed cost to the Department.</P>
            <P>(2) The Department may contact any port prior to award to determine the port's cargo handling capabilities, including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect the cargo. Factors considered in this determination may include, but not be limited to, the adequacy of building structures, proper ventilation, freedom from insects and rodents, cleanliness, and overall good housekeeping and warehousing practices. The Department may consider the use of another coastal range or port if a situation exists at a port that may adversely affect the ability of the Department to have the commodity delivered in a safe and timely manner. Such situations include:</P>
            <P>(i) A port is congested;</P>
            <P>(ii) Port facilities are overloaded;</P>
            <P>(iii) A vessel would not be able to dock and load cargo without delay;</P>
            <P>(iv) Labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; or</P>
            <P>(v) Other similar situation that may adversely affect the ability of the Department to have the commodity delivered in a timely manner.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of other than lowest landed cost.</E> In order to ensure that commodities are delivered in a timely fashion to foreign destinations and without damage, the contracting officer may award an acquisition without regard to the lowest land cost process set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section if:</P>
            <P>(i) The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or</P>
            <P>(ii) After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:</P>
            <P>(A) Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign destination;</P>
            <P>(B) A specific port's cargo handling capabilities (including the adequacy of the port to receive, accumulate, handle, store, and protect commodities) and other similar factors may adversely affect the delivery of such commodities through damage or untimely delivery. Such similar factors include, but are not limited to: port congestion; overloaded facilities at the port; vessels not being able to dock and load cargo without delay due to conditions at the port; labor disputes or lack of labor may prohibit the loading of the cargo onboard a vessel in a timely manner; and the existence of inadequate or unsanitary warehouse and other supporting facilities;</P>
            <P>(C) The total transit time of a carrier, as it relates to a final delivery date at the foreign destination may impair the timely delivery of the commodity;</P>
            <P>(D) Other similar situations arise that materially affect the administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is being procured; or</P>

            <P>(E) The contracting officer determines that extenuating circumstances preclude awards on the basis of lowest-landed cost, or that efficiency and cost-savings justify use of types of ocean <PRTPAGE P="143"/>service that would not involve an analysis of freight. However, in all such cases, commodities would be transported in compliance with cargo preference requirements. Examples of extenuating circumstances are events such as internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatening the lives of persons at the foreign destination. Other types of services may include, but are not limited to, multi-trip voyage charters, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), delivery cost and freight (C &amp; F), delivery cost insurance and freight (CIF), and indexed ocean freight costs.</P>
            <P>(4) If a contracting officer determines that action may be appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer will provide to the Head of Contracting Activity Designee a written request to obtain commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost basis consistent with Title 48 Code of Federal Regulations. This request shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed cost basis. The Head of the Contracting Activity Designee, or the designee one level above the contracting officer, may either accept or reject this request and shall document this determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multiple offers or delivery points.</E> If more than one offer for the sale of commodities is received or more than one delivery point has been designated in such offers, in order to achieve a combination of a freight rate and commodity award that produces the lowest landed cost for the delivery of the commodity to the foreign destination, the contracting officer shall evaluate offers submitted on a delivery point by delivery point basis; however, consideration shall be given to prioritized ocean transport service in determining lowest landed cost.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Freight shipping and rates.</E> (1) In determining the lowest-landed cost, the Department shall use the freight rates offered in response to solicitations issued by the Department or, if applicable, the grantee organization.</P>
            <P>(2) Freight rates offered must be submitted as specified in the solicitation issued by the Department or, if applicable, the grantee organization. Any such solicitation issued by a grantee organization must contain the following elements:</P>
            <P>(i) If directed by the Department, include a closing time for the receipt of written freight offers and state that late written freight offers will not be considered;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide that freight offers are required to have a canceling date no later than the last contract lay day specified in the solicitation;</P>
            <P>(iii) Provide the same deadline for receipt of written freight offers from both U.S. flag vessel and non-U.S. flag vessels; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Be received and opened prior to any related offer for acquisition of commodities to be shipped.</P>
            <P>(3) The Department may require organizations that will receive commodities from the Department to submit information relating to the capacity of a U.S. port, or, if applicable, a terminal, prior to the acquisition of such commodities or freight.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Freight rate notification.</E> If the Department is not the party procuring freight with respect to a shipment of an agricultural commodity for delivery to a foreign destination, the organization that will receive commodities from the Department, or its shipping agent, shall be notified by the Department of the vessel freight rate used in determining the commodity contract award and the organization will be responsible for finalizing the charter or booking contract with the vessel representing the freight rate.</P>

            <P>(i) The solicitation specifies that the lowest land cost process will not be followed in the completion of the contract; or</P>
            <P>(ii) After issuance of the solicitation, it is determined that:</P>
            <P>(A) Internal strife at the foreign destination or urgent humanitarian conditions threatens the lives of persons at the foreign destination;</P>

            <P>(D) Other similar situations arise that materially affect the administration of the program for which the commodity or freight is being procured.</P>

            <P>(4) If the contracting officer determines that action may be appropriate under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, prior to the acceptance of any applicable offer, the contracting officer shall provide to the head of contracting activity designee and to USAID, a written request to obtain commodities and freight in a manner other than on a lowest landed cost basis. This request shall include a statement of the reasons for not using lowest landed cost basis.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Freight shipping and rates.</E> (1) In determining lowest-landed cost as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department shall use vessel rates offered in response to solicitations issued by USAID or grantee organizations receiving commodities under 7 U.S.C. 1731 <E T="03">et seq.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) USAID may require, or direct a grantee organization to require, an ocean carrier to submit offers electronically through a Web-based system maintained by the Department.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Delivery date.</E> The contracting officer shall consider total transit time, as it relates to a final delivery date, in order to satisfy Public Law 480 Title II program requirements.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Delivery points.</E> (1) Commodities offered for delivery free alongside ship Great Lakes port range or intermodal bridge-point Great Lakes port range that represent the overall (foreign and U.S. flag) lowest landed cost will be awarded on a lowest landed cost basis. Tonnage allocated on this basis will not be reevaluated on a lowest landed cost U.S.-flag basis unless the contracting officer determines that 25 percent of the total annual tonnage of bagged, processed, or fortified commodities furnished under 7 U.S.C. 1731 <E T="03">et seq.</E> has been, or will be, transported from the Great Lakes port range during that fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(2) The contracting officer shall consider commodity offers as offers for delivery “intermodal bridge-point Great Lakes port range” only if:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The GSAR applies to contracts for suppliers or services, including construction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acquisition of leasehold interests in real property.</E> Part 570 establishes rules for the acquisition of leasehold interests in real property. Other provisions of 48 CFR chapter 5 (GSAR) do not apply to leases of real property unless specifically cross-reference in part 570.</P>

              <P>(a) The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, makes determinations under FAR 3.204.</P>
              <P>The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, takes all the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Coordinates with legal counsel;</P>
              <P>(2) Initiates proceedings under FAR 3.204(a) by notifying the contractor that GSA is considering action against the contractor for a violation of the Gratuities clause. Notice is sent by a certified letter to the last known address of the party, its counsel, or agent for service of process. In the case of a business, notice is sent to any partner, principal officer, director, owner or co-owner; and</P>
              <P>(3) Presumes receipt if no return receipt is received within 10 calendar days after mailing the notice.</P>
              <P>(b) The contractor has 30 calendar days to exercise its rights under FAR 3.204(b), unless the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, grants an extension.</P>
              <P>(c) If there is a dispute of fact material to making a determination, the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, may refer the matter to an agency fact-finding official, designated by the Suspension and Debarment Official, in accordance with GSAR 509.403. Referrals for fact-finding are not made in cases arising from a conviction or indictment as defined in FAR 9.403. If a referral is made, the fact-finding official takes all the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Gives the contractor an opportunity to dispute material facts relating to the determinations under FAR 3.204(a)(1) and (2);</P>
              <P>(2) Conducts proceedings under rules consistent with FAR 3.204(b);</P>
              <P>(3) Schedules a hearing within 20 calendar days of receipt of the referral. The contractor or GSA may request an extension for good cause; and</P>
              <P>(4) Delivers to the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, written findings of fact (together with a transcription of the proceedings, if made) within 20 calendar days after the hearing record closes. The findings must resolve any material disputes of fact by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
              <P>(d) The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, may reject the findings of the fact-finding official only if the findings are clearly erroneous or arbitrary and capricious.</P>
              <P>(e) In cases arising from conviction or indictment, or in which there are no disputes of material fact, the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, conducts the hearing required by FAR 3.204(b).</P>
              <P>(f) If the Gratuities clause was violated, the contractor may present evidence of mitigating factors to the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, in accordance with FAR 3.204(b) either orally or in writing, consistent with a schedule the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, establishes. The Senior Procurement Executive, or designee, exercises the Government's rights under FAR 3.204(c) only after considering mitigating factors.</P>

This one-time charge covers the setup and certification required for an integrator to access the FPDS database and for technical assistance to help integrators use the web services. The fee will be paid to the FPDS contractor and credited to invoices submitted to GSA by the FPDS contractor.</P>

              <P>In addition to the requirements found in FAR 4.1103, prior to awarding a contractual instrument the contracting officer must—</P>

              <P>(a) Verify that the prospective contractor's legal business name, Doing-Business-As (DBA) name (if any), physical street address, and Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number or DUNS+4 number, as found in the System for Award Management (SAM), match the information that will be included in the contract, order, or agreement resulting from the vendor's quote <PRTPAGE P="154"/>or proposal. Correct any mismatches by having the vendor amend the information in the SAM and/or the quote or proposal. The SAM information can be accessed through the SAM Web site (<E T="03">www.sam.gov</E>) by creating a user account.</P>
              <P>(b) Ensure that the contractor's address code exists in Pegasys and that it is SAM enabled with the contractor's DUNS or DUNS+4 number. This can be done by searching Pegasys records using the contractor's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). If no code exists, request that a new address code be established by the Finance Center for SAM compliance.</P>
              <P>(c) Ensure that the contractor's identifying information is correctly placed on the contractual instrument, using special care to ensure that the legal name and “remit to” name match exactly. (Note: Lockbox names or numbers should not be used to replace the contractor's name in the remittance block on the contractual instrument.)</P>
              <P>(d) Unless one of the exceptions to registration in SAM applies (see FAR 4.1102(a)), the contracting officer must not award a contract to a prospective contractor who is not registered in SAM. If no exceptions are applicable, and the needs of the requiring activity allows for a delay in award, see FAR 4.1103(b)(1).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Investigation and referral.</E> (1) Refer to the Suspension and Debarment Official matters involving serious contract improprieties or performance deficiencies. Performance deficiencies that continue over a period of time or apply to more than one contract may warrant debarment consideration.</P>
              <P>(2) Refer possible criminal or fraudulent activities to the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). See 5 CFR 6701.107, Reporting Waste, Fraud, Abuse, and Corruption. If, after investigation, the OIG believes a cause for debarment exists, it will refer the matter to the Suspension and Debarment Official for consideration of debarment action.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reports.</E> Include in referrals to the Suspension and Debarment Official a report that contains at least the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The recommendation and supporting rationale.</P>
              <P>(2) A list of parties to be considered for possible debarment, including the contractor, principals, and affiliates. Include last known home and business addresses, zip codes, and DUNS Numbers.</P>
              <P>(3) A statement of facts.</P>
              <P>(4) Copies of documentary evidence and a list of witnesses. Include addresses and telephone numbers. Determine their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and identify the subject matter of their testimony.</P>
              <P>(5) GSA's acquisition history with the contractor. Include recent experience, copies of the pertinent contracts, and an explanation of impact debarment would have on GSA programs. OIG referrals do not require this explanation; the Suspension and Debarment Official will obtain the information directly from the contracting activity(s).</P>
              <P>(6) A list of any known active or potential criminal investigations, criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims before the Board of Contract Appeals.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review.</E> The Suspension and Debarment Official will review the report, and after coordinating with assigned legal counsel—</P>
              <P>(1) Initiate debarment action;</P>
              <P>(2) Decline debarment action;</P>
              <P>(3) Request additional information; or</P>
              <P>(4) Refer the matter to the OIG for further investigation and development of a case file.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Decisionmaking process.</E> (1) The Suspension and Debarment Official will provide:</P>
              <P>(i) Notice of declinations, proposed debarments, and decisions to the referring activity.</P>
              <P>(ii) Notice of proposed debarment to each party being considered for debarment.</P>
              <P>(iii) Decision notices to each party after considering information in the administrative record and information and argument submitted by the affected party or parties.</P>
              <P>(2) A party proposed for debarment:</P>
              <P>(i) Has 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice to respond to the Suspension and Debarment Official or the debarment becomes final.</P>
              <P>(ii) May request and receive a copy of the administrative record that was the basis for the proposed debarment. If information is withheld, the party will be notified and provided the reason.</P>

              <P>(iii) May request the opportunity to present information and argument in person to the Suspension and Debarment Official. The Suspension and Debarment Official will schedule an oral presentation within 20 calendar days of receipt of the request, unless a longer period of time is requested by the party. An oral presentation is informal and a transcript usually is not made. The party may supplement the oral presentation with written information and arguments.<PRTPAGE P="158"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) May identify to the Suspension and Debarment Official material facts in dispute and the bases. For an action other than one based on a conviction of civil judgment, a party may request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official.</P>
              <P>(3) Following a review of the record and, if needed, a presentation by the contractor in opposition to the proposed action, the Suspension and Debarment Official will determine whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact. If so, the Suspension and Debarment Official will initiate the fact-finding process. The fact-finding official will:</P>
              <P>(i) Establish a date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within 45 days of the determination of who will function as the fact-finding official.</P>
              <P>(ii) Grant extensions for good cause.</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide notice of the scheduled hearing.</P>
              <P>(iv) Provide the parties with a schedule for exchange of documents and witness lists.</P>
              <P>(v) Develop an official transcript of the fact-finding proceeding.</P>
              <P>(vi) Provide the Government's representative and the contractor with an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the facts at issue. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative.</P>
              <P>(vii) Conduct hearings under rules consistent with FAR 9.406-3 pertaining to fact finding. Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact finding. Hearsay evidence may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finding official.</P>
              <P>(viii) Provide for witness testimony. Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses are subject to cross examination.</P>
              <P>(ix) Prepare written findings of fact based on a preponderance of the evidence and submit them to both the Suspension and Debarment Official and the contractor within 20 calendar days following the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding.</P>

              <P>(2) If the action is not based on an indictment, the Suspension and Debarment Official must coordinate with the Department of Justice or state prosecutorial authority through OIG. Based on the advice received, the Suspension and Debarment Official will determine if fact-finding would impair substantial interests of the Federal or state Government. In an action not based on an indictment, a suspended party may:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify to the Suspension and Debarment Official material facts in dispute and the bases.</P>
              <P>(ii) Request review and a written finding by a fact-finding official to resolve genuine disputes of material fact. For procedures involving a genuine dispute of material fact, see 509.406-3(d)(3).</P>

              <P>(a) The purpose of the DPAS is to assure the timely availability of industrial resources to meet current national defense, energy, and civil emergency preparedness program requirements and to provide an operating system to support rapid industrial response in a national emergency. The primary statutory authority for the DPAS is Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, with additional authority from the Selective Service Act of 1948 and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Executive Orders 12919 and 12742 delegate to the DOC authority to administer the DPAS. Within the DOC, the Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security (SIES) is assigned responsibility for DPAS implementation, administration, and compliance.</P>
              <P>(b) The DPAS is published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 15 CFR part 700. This regulation provides an overview, a detailed explanation of operations and procedures, and other implementing guidance, including information on special priorities assistance and compliance.</P>
              <P>(c) Orders placed under DPAS are “rated orders.” Rated orders must receive preferential treatment only as necessary to meet delivery requirements. Rated orders are identified by a rating symbol of either “DX” or “DO” followed by a program identification symbol. All “DO” rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All “DX” rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over “DO” rated orders and unrated orders. A program identification symbol indicates which approved program is supported by the rated order.</P>

              <P>(a) A DPAS rating may be placed against an entire contract at time of award or an individual order issued under an existing, otherwise unrated, contract. FAR 11.604 requires contracting officers to insert the provision at 52.211-14, Notice of Priority Rating for National Defense, Emergency Preparedness, and Energy Program Use, in solicitations when the contract or order to be awarded will be a rated order and to insert the clause at 52.211-15, Defense Priority and Allocation Requirements, in contracts that are rated orders.</P>

              <P>(b) In addition to the FAR provision and clause referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, the contract or order must include the following (<E T="03">see</E> 15 CFR 700.12):</P>
              <P>(1) The appropriate priority rating symbol (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> either “DO” or “DX”) along with the program identification symbol. When GSA contracting officers place DO rated orders, they must use program identification symbol “K1”. When placing a DX-rated order for other agencies, GSA contracting officers must use the requesting agency program identification symbol from the DoD Master Urgency List and may only do so when GSA is acting as the procuring agent for DoD or DoE and has received a “DX” rated contract or order from either department.<PRTPAGE P="162"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A required delivery date. The words “as soon as possible” or “immediately” do not constitute a required delivery date. Use of either a specific date or a specified number of days ARO (after receipt of order) is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(3) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order of an individual authorized to place rated orders.</P>
              <P>(4) A statement that reads substantially as follows: “This is a rated order certified for national defense use, and you are required to follow all the provisions of the Defense Priorities and Allocations System regulation (15 CFR part 700)”.</P>
              <P>(c) Multiple and Single Award Schedule contracts are not rated at time of award.</P>

              <P>GSA has a deviation to FAR 12.216 for this section. For commercial contracts, supplier license agreements are referred to as commercial supplier agreements (defined in 502.101). Paragraph (u) of clause 552.212-4 prevents violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) for supplies or services acquired subject to a commercial supplier agreement.</P>

The individual price for each item does not have to be the lowest bid received. (See also the definition of a “line item” in FAR 3.302.)</P>

              <P>(a) GSA usually solicits prices and reserves the right to make award for <PRTPAGE P="166"/>individual line items. In some cases it serves GSA's best interest to combine two or more line items for an aggregate award. Such cases include when:</P>
              <P>(1) Users desire uniformity of design, style, and finish (e.g., suites of household furniture).</P>
              <P>(2) The articles will be assembled and used as a unit, and different manufacturers' components may not be interchangeable.</P>
              <P>(3) Users have high demand for certain articles, but demand for related articles is insufficient to attract competitive bids (e.g., various sized of socket wrenches). Awarding the low-demand articles in conjunction with the high-demand articles may encourage competition.</P>
              <P>(4) Awarding the low-demand articles in conjunction with the high-demand articles may encourage competition.</P>
              <P>(5) One location (delivery point) has a large requirement, and another location has a requirement too small to individually attract competitive bids.</P>
              <P>(6) Awarding and administering numerous small contracts for similar articles or services is impractical.</P>
              <P>(b) Before deciding to combine items for aggregate award, the contracting officer should consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) The capability of bidders to furnish the types and quantities of supplies or services in the aggregate.</P>
              <P>(2) How grouping delivery points will affect bidders.</P>
              <P>(3) Which combinations will accurately project the lowest overall cost to the Government.</P>
              <P>(c) The contracting officer should not use an aggregate award if it will significantly restrict the number of eligible bidders.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evaluation factors for award.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The solicitation should clearly state the basis for evaluating bids for aggregate award, require bidders to submit a price on each item within the group or a percentage to be added or subtracted from a list price, and advise bidders that failure to submit prices as required within a group makes a bid ineligible for award for that group.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Supplies and services.</E> This subsection applies to acquisitions of supplies and services.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect on compeition.</E> Provide for full and open competition when grouping items for award. Grouping items for award may preclude a significant of firms from bidding. This occurs if firms are unable to provide all the types or quanities of supplies or services, or make deliveries to the various delivery points included in the prospective aggregate group.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Grouping different articles.</E> Include only related articles in an aggregate group. Related articles are those normally manufactured or produced by a majority of prospective bidders. Grouping unrelated articles often restricts competition unnecessarily.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Grouping geographic locations or delivery points.</E> Consider the following guidelines before deciding to group different geographic locations or delivery points:</P>
              <P>(1) A delivery point may have sufficient requirements so that individual shipments involve economic production runs and carload or truckload quanities. In this case, list it as a separate line item.</P>
              <P>(2) The types of bidders (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> small or large firms, manufacturers or distributors, etc.) who responded to previous solicitations can provide important information. For example, if previous bidders are distributors with franchises in certain territories, grouping different territories could tend to restrict competition.</P>
              <P>(3) Transportation costs can affect competition and pricing. They may constitute a significant portion of the total delivered cost. Obtain the advice and assistance of transportation specialists before grouping geographic locations or delivery points. Depending upon the supplies being acquired:</P>

              <P>(i) Grouping widespread geographic locations or delivery points may reduce competition or result in higher prices. It can cause the loss of “area pricing” <PRTPAGE P="167"/>advantages provided by a supplier with a single production point.</P>
              <P>(ii) Conversely, for many small commercial items (hand tools, locks, etc.), manufacturers may quote the same price for delivery anywhere in the U.S.</P>
              <P>(iii) Tariff boundaries can also affect how manufacturers price deliveries to different areas.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evaluation methodologies for aggregate awards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definite quantity contracts without options.</E> For definite quantity contracts without options, the evaluated bid price is the total bid price, as adjusted for any price-related factors identified in the solicitation. This reflects the actual cost to the Government and will identify the most advantageous bid.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Indefinite quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and options.</E> Indefinite quantity and requirements contracts use estimated quantities. Options involve the probability of whether and when the options will be exercised. These situations may result in unbalanced bids (see FAR 15.404-1(g)), leading to inaccurate evaluation of the projected cost and award to other than the most advantageous bid. To avoid unbalanced bids, GSA has two preferred methods for evaluating bids for aggregate awards: weight factors and price list.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Weight factors method.</E> Assign a weight to each item in a group. The weight is based on the portion of quantities that item represents. To evaluate bids, multiply each unit price by its weight factor, then total the results.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Price list method.</E> Establish prices for bidders to use as a base for preparing their bids. Prepare a list that identifies a base price for each item in a group. Bidders bid a percentage factor to add to or subtract from the base price.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Guidelines for using the weight factors method.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Use the weight factors method when there are reliable estimates for the quantities needed in an acquisition. Reliable estimates of quantities form the foundation for:</P>
              <P>(1) Accurate evaluation of the projected cost of each bid.</P>
              <P>(2) An appropriate determination of which bid is most advantageous to the Government for the aggregate group.</P>
              <P>(b) Assign a weight factor to each item in a group. Develop the weight factor by calculating the portion of the total quantity in a defined group that each item represents.</P>
              <P>(c) To evaluate bid prices, first multiply the price bid for each item (unit price X quantity) by its weight factor. Then, add the subtotals together to project the cost for the aggregate group.</P>
              <P>(d) Estimated quantities may be reduced to smaller numbers by a common denominator. This may help facilitate the computations involved in evaluating bids.</P>
              <P>(e) Consider all price-related factors identified in the solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible bidder with the lowest evaluated overall cost to the Government for the aggregate group. This represents the most advantageous bid.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Guidelines for using the price list method.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The price list method helps avoid unbalanced bidding when making aggregate awards, but lack accurate estimates of anticipated quantities. This method establishes base prices for bidders to use in preparing their bids.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Solicitation requirements.</E> When using the price list method, in the solicitation:</P>
              <P>(1) Include the price list.</P>
              <P>(2) Include an estimate of requirements.</P>

              <P>(3) Require the bidder to express its price as “net” or as a percentage added to or subtracted from the list prices for each group. Require the bidder to quote only one percentage factor for each group. This means that the bidder provides one percentage factor that applies to every item in a group; not a separate percentage for each item. “Net” indicates the bidder chooses to submit the list prices as its bid.<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Identify the percentage factor in paragraph (b)(3) of this section as a price related evaluation factor.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Developing list prices.</E> Price lists may be developed using one or more of the following sources:</P>
              <P>(1) Industry published prices.</P>
              <P>(2) Industry surveys.</P>
              <P>(3) Government cost estimates based on knowledge of the supplies or services and previous contract prices.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">First time use for an item or service.</E> The first time the contracting officer uses list prices for an item or service, give prospective bidders an opportunity to review the proposed list. Also provide information on how GSA will use the list prices. This information may be provided in a draft solicitation.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Balanced prices.</E> Ensure that the list prices for the grouped items bear a reasonable and balanced relationship to one another. Prices may be used from previous awards made using the weight factors method to develop price lists. Review those prices first to ensure they did not result from unbalanced bidding.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Evaluation and award.</E> Consider all price-related factors identified in the solicitation. Award to the responsive and responsible bidder whose percentage factor produces the most favorable price to the Government. This represents the most advantageous bid.</P>

The term customer includes, but is not limited to original equipment manufacturers, value added resellers, state and local Governments, distributors, educational institutions (an elementary, junior high, or degree granting school which maintains a regular faculty and established curriculum and an organized body of students), dealers, national accounts, and end users. In any instance where the Offeror is asked to disclose information for a customer, the Offeror may disclose information by category of customer if the Offeror's discount policies or practices are the same for all customers in the category.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Column 2—Identify the Discount</HD>

                <P>The term “discount” is as defined in solicitation clause 552.212-70, Preparation of Offer (Multiple Award Schedule). Indicate the best discount (based on your written discounting policies or standard commercial discounting practices if you do not have written discounting policies) at which you sell to the customer or category of customer identified in column 1, without regard to quantity; terms and conditions of the agreements under which the discounts are given; and whether the agreements are written or oral. Net prices or discounts off of other price lists should be expressed as percentage discounts from the price list which is the basis of your offer. If the discount disclosed is a combination of various discounts (prompt payment, quantity, etc.), the percentage should be broken out for each type of discount. If the price lists which are the basis of the discounts given to the customers identified in the chart are different than the price list submitted upon which your offer is based, identify the type or title and date of each price list. The contracting officer may require submission of these price lists. To expedite evaluation, offerors may provide these price lists at the time of submission.<PRTPAGE P="174"/>

Your explanation should include a discussion of situations that lead to deviations from standard practice, an explanation of how often they occur, and the controls you employ to assure the integrity of your pricing. Examples of typical deviations may include, but are not limited to, one time goodwill discounts to charity organizations or to compensate an otherwise disgruntled customer; a limited sale of obsolete or damaged goods; the sale of sample goods to a new customer, or the sales of prototype goods for testing purposes.</P>

The Contracting Officer may ask for information to demonstrate that you have made substantial sales of the item(s) in the commercial market consistent with the information reflected on the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices Format, a description of the conditions surrounding those sales deviations, or other information that may be necessary in order for the Contracting Officer to determine whether your offered price(s) is fair and reasonable. In cases where additional information is requested the Contracting Officer will target the request in order to limit the submission of data to that needed to establish the reasonableness of the offered price.</P>

                <P>(d) When the contract contains the basic clause 552.238-80 Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting, insert the clause at 552.215-72, Price Adjustment—Failure to Provide Accurate Information, in solicitations and contracts under the MAS program.</P>
                <P>(e) Use Alternate IV of FAR 52.215-21, Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data—Modifications, to provide for submission of information other than cost or pricing data for MAS contracts. To provide for uniformity in requests under the MAS program, insert the following in paragraph (b) of the clause:</P>
                <P>(1) Information required by the clause at 552.238-81, Modifications (Multiple Award Schedule).</P>
                <P>(2) Any additional supporting information requested by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may require additional supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable.</P>
                <P>(3) By submitting a request for modification, the Contractor grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine, at any time before agreeing to a modification, books, record, documents, papers, and other directly pertinent records to verify the pricing, sales and other data related to the supplies or services proposed in order to determine the reasonableness of price(s). Access does not extent to Contractor's cost or profit information or other data related solely to the Contractor's determination of the prices to be offered in the catalog or marketplace.</P>

              <P>(1) If the contract includes one or more options to extend the term of the contract, use the clause with its Alternate I or a clause substantially the same as 552.216-71 with its Alternate I suitably modified.</P>

              <P>(3) If the Producer Price Index is not an appropriate indicator for price adjustment, modify the clause to use an alternate indicator for adjusting prices. Similarly, if other aspects of 552.216-71 are not appropriate, use an alternate clause following established procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material.</E> (1) If the contracting officer decides to provide for adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material, prepare a clause that defines each of the following elements:</P>

The contracting officer or designee must review the processing of invoices or vouchers before payment to determine if the items and amounts claimed are consistent with the contract terms and represent prudent business transactions. The contracting officer must ensure that these payments are commensurate with physical and technical progress under the contract. If the contractor has not deducted questionable amounts from the invoice or amounts required to be withheld, the contracting officer must make the required deduction, except as provided in 532.7203. Subject to 532.7201, the contracting officer must note approval of any payment on (or attached to) the invoice or voucher submitted by the contractor and forward the invoice or voucher to the appropriate contract finance office for retention after certification and scheduling for payment by a disbursing office.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Filing a protest.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Any protester filing an agency protest has the choice of requesting either that the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest is silent on this matter, the contracting officer will decide the protest. If a party requests a review at a level above the contracting officer, the Agency Protest Official will decide the protest. The decision by the Agency Protest Official for GSA is an alternative to a decision by the contracting officer on a protest. The Agency Protest Official for GSA will not <PRTPAGE P="186"/>consider an appeal of the contracting officer's decision on an agency protest.</P>
              <P>(b) If an agency protest is filed, the deciding official uses the procedures in FAR 33.103 and this section to resolve the protest. The deciding official will provide a fair and quick review of any protest filed with the agency.</P>
              <P>(c) The filing timeframes in FAR 33.103(e) apply. An agency protest is filed when the complete protest is received at the location the solicitation designates for serving protests. GSA's hours of operation are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Protests delivered after 4:30 p.m. will be considered received and filed the following business day.</P>
              <P>(d) The protest must meet all the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(1) Include the information required by FAR 33.103(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.</P>
              <P>(3) Be filed in writing with the contracting officer.</P>
              <P>(4) State whether the protester chooses to have the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest does not include the protester's choice, then the contracting officer will decide the protest (see paragraph (a) of this subsection).</P>
              <P>(e) The following procedures apply to information submitted in support of or in response to an agency protest:</P>
              <P>(1) GSA procedures do not provide for any discovery.</P>
              <P>(2) The deciding official has discretion to request additional information from either the agency or the protester, orally or in writing, as may be necessary to render a timely decision on the protest. However, protests are normally decided on the basis of information initially provided by the protester and the agency.</P>
              <P>(3) To the extent permitted by law and regulations, the parties may exchange relevant information.</P>
              <P>(4) The agency must make a written response to the protest within ten days unless another date is set by the deciding official.</P>

              <P>(5) The agency must also provide the protester with a copy of the response on the same day it files the protest response with the deciding official. If the agency believes it needs to redact or withhold any information in the response from the protester, it should identify and provide the information to the deciding official for <E T="03">in camera</E> review.</P>
              <P>(f) A protester may represent itself or be represented by legal counsel. GSA will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.</P>
              <P>(g) GSA may dismiss or stay proceedings on an agency protest if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum outside of GSA.</P>

Contracts for construction management services are covered by FAR Part 37 and GSAM Part 537. Part 536 shall take precedence when the acquisition involves (1) construction or architect-engineer services, and (2) when the requirement is inconsistent with another part of the GSAR.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of options.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Subject to the limitations in this section, contracting officers may include options in contracts when it is in the Government's interest.</P>
              <P>(b) The scope of work in the base contract at award shall require the contractor to provide a discrete and fully functional deliverable. Options shall not be used to incrementally deliver work required to fulfill the requirements of the scope of work for the base contract.</P>
              <P>(c) Contracting officers shall justify in writing the use of options.</P>
              <P>(d) Including an option may be in the Government's interest when, in the judgment of the contracting officer:</P>
              <P>(1) Additional work beyond the base contract is reasonably foreseeable;</P>
              <P>(2) It would not be advantageous to award a separate contract;</P>
              <P>(3) It would not be advantageous to permit an additional contractor to work on the same site;</P>
              <P>(4) Services arising out of or relating to the underlying construction contract may be required during or after substantial completion of the scope of work. For instance, if building equipment (e.g., mechanical and electrical equipment) will be installed under the construction contract, it may be advantageous to have the construction contractor maintain and service the equipment. In such an instance, the services performed may be included as an option to the underlying construction contract. Contracting officers shall ensure that the applicable clauses are included in any such option (e.g., Service Contract Act); or</P>
              <P>(5) It is otherwise justified.</P>

              <P>(e) Options for construction work may provide for an economic price adjustment based on cost or price indexes of labor or materials (see FAR 16.203-<PRTPAGE P="188"/>4(d)). Subject to the approval of the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA), the contracting officer may develop and insert a project-specific price adjustment clause into the solicitation.</P>

              <P>Solicitations containing options shall:</P>
              <P>(a) Include appropriate option provisions and clauses when resulting contracts will provide for the exercise of options (see 536.270-5);</P>
              <P>(b) State the period within which the options may be exercised; and</P>
              <P>(c) State whether the basis of evaluation is inclusive or exclusive of the options (if exclusive, see 536.270-4(c)).</P>

              <P>For sealed bidding that includes options:</P>
              <P>(a) The low bidder for purposes of award is the responsible bidder offering the lowest aggregate price for the base bid and all options designated to be evaluated.</P>
              <P>(b) Before opening bids that include options, the contracting officer must determine, and record in the contract file, the amount of funds available for the project. The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the bid opening. This amount may be increased later when determining the items to be awarded to the low bidder if the following condition is met: The award amount of the base bid and evaluated options does not exceed the amount offered for the base bid, the evaluated options, and the same combination of items by any other responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation. This requirement prevents the displacement of the low bidder by manipulating the options to be used.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exercise of options.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The contracting officer shall exercise options in writing within the time period specified in the contract.</P>
              <P>(b) The contracting officer may exercise options only after determining, in writing, that all the following conditions exist:</P>
              <P>(1) Funds are available.</P>
              <P>(2) The requirement covered by the option fulfills an existing Government need.</P>
              <P>(3) Exercising the option is the most advantageous method of satisfying the Government's need, price and other factors considered.</P>
              <P>(4) The contractor is not listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions (see FAR 9.405-1).</P>
              <P>(5) The contractor's performance under the contract met or exceeded the Government's expectation for quality performance, unless another circumstance justifies an extended contractual relationship.</P>
              <P>(6) Exercising the option is in accordance with the terms of the option.</P>
              <P>(7) The option price is fair and reasonable, unless already determined as such (e.g., at time of award).</P>
              <P>(c) The contract modification, or other written document which notifies the contractor of the exercise of the option, must cite the option clause as authority. If exercising an unpriced or unevaluated option, cite the statutory authority permitting the use of other than full and open competition (see FAR 6.302).</P>
              <P>(d) When the contract provides for economic price adjustment and the contractor requests a revision of the price, the contracting officer shall determine the effect of the adjustment on prices under the option before the option is exercised.</P>

              <P>(b) Insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 552.236-75, Evaluation Exclusive of Options, in solicitations for fixed-price construction contracts when the solicitation includes an option clause and options will not be included in the evaluation for award purposes.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Selection criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) FAR 36.602-1 requires that agencies include “location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of locality of the project” as one of several selection criteria.</P>
              <P>(1) Do not use this evaluation factor as a minimum qualification requirement for determining whether a firm is eligible to compete for a proposed project.</P>

              <P>(2) This factor must not exceed 5 percent of the total weight of all evaluation criteria. In order to receive maximum score for this factor, the architect-engineer firm(s) must demonstrate <PRTPAGE P="190"/>that at least 35 percent of the architect-engineer contract services (based on the total contract price) will be accomplished within the geographical boundaries established for the project.</P>
              <P>(3) Under an approved class deviation from FAR 36.602-1(a)(5), this factor does not apply to projects that the Chief Architect of GSA determines have national significance.</P>
              <P>(b) The public announcement (FedBizOpps notice) for a proposed project should identify the general geographical area of the project by either:</P>
              <P>(1) A radius in miles or other appropriate unit of measure.</P>
              <P>(2) The Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, county(ies), state(s) surrounding the project, or other appropriate geographic boundaries.</P>
              <P>(c) Architect-engineer selections under the Design Excellence Program must apply the geographical evaluation criteria in the second phase.</P>
              <P>(d) The public announcement (FedBizOpps notice) must provide the number of calendar days the architect-engineer of record has to establish a production capability within the general geographical area of the project. You may allow the architect-engineer of record up to 45 calendar days after contract award to establish this production capability.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evaluation of offers without access to transactional data.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Utilize this evaluation methodology for negotiating MAS offers when the commercial sales practices format is included in the solicitation (see 515.408).</P>
              <P>(b) When offerors have commercial catalogs, negotiate concessions from established catalogs, including price and non-price terms and conditions.</P>
              <P>(c) The Government will seek to obtain the offeror's best price (the best price given to the most favored customer). However, the Government recognizes that the terms and conditions of commercial sales vary and there may be legitimate reasons why the best price is not achieved.</P>
              <P>(d) Establish negotiation objectives based on a review of relevant data and determine price reasonableness.</P>
              <P>(e) When establishing negotiation objectives and determining price reasonableness, compare the terms and conditions of the MAS solicitation with the terms and conditions of agreements with the offeror's commercial customers. When determining the Government's price negotiation objectives, consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(1) Aggregate volume of anticipated purchases.</P>
              <P>(2) The purchase of a minimum quantity or a pattern of historic purchases.</P>
              <P>(3) Prices taking into consideration any combination of discounts and concessions offered to commercial customers.</P>
              <P>(4) Length of the contract period.</P>
              <P>(5) Warranties, training, and/or maintenance included in the purchase price or provided at additional cost to the product prices.</P>
              <P>(6) Ordering and delivery practices.</P>

              <P>(7) Any other relevant information, including differences between the MAS solicitation and commercial terms and conditions that may warrant differentials between the offer and the discounts offered to the most favored commercial customer(s). For example, <PRTPAGE P="192"/>an offeror may incur more expense selling to the Government than to the customer who receives the offeror's best price, or the customer (e.g., dealer, distributor, original equipment manufacturer, other reseller) who receives the best price may perform certain value-added functions for the offeror that the Government does not perform. In such cases, some reduction in the discount given to the Government may be appropriate. If the best price is not offered to the Government, you should ask the offeror to identify and explain the reason for any differences. Do not require offerors to provide detailed cost breakdowns.</P>
              <P>(f) You may award a contract containing pricing which is less favorable than the best price the offeror extends to any commercial customer for similar purchases if you make a determination that both of the following conditions exist:</P>
              <P>(1) The prices offered to the Government are fair and reasonable, even though comparable discounts were not negotiated.</P>
              <P>(2) Award is otherwise in the best interest of the Government.</P>
              <P>(g) State clearly in the award document the price/discount relationship between the Government and the identified commercial customer (or category of customers) upon which the award is based.</P>

              <SUBJECT>FSS contract awards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) FSS awards will be for commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101.</P>
              <P>(b) Before awarding any FSS contract, determine that the offered prices are fair and reasonable (see FAR subpart 15.4 and 538.270). Document the negotiation and your determination using FAR 15.406-3 as guidance.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies when the contract contains the basic clause 552.238-80 Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting.</P>
              <P>(b) The basic clause and Alternate I of 552.238-81, Price Reductions, requires the contractor to maintain during the contract period the negotiated price/discount relationship (and/or term and condition relationship) between the eligible ordering activities and the offeror's customer or category of customers on which the contract award was predicated (see 538.271(c)). If a change occurs in the contractor's commercial pricing or discount arrangement applicable to the identified commercial customer (or category of customers) that results in a less advantageous relationship between the eligible ordering activities and this customer or category of customers, the change constitutes a “price reduction.”</P>
              <P>(c) Ensure that the contractor understands the requirements of section 552.238-75 and agrees to report all price reductions to the Contracting Officer as provided for in the clause.</P>

              <P>(c) Contracting activities shall coordinate with requiring activities and program officials to ensure that the solicitation documents include the appropriate information security requirements. The information security requirements must be sufficiently detailed to enable service providers to fully understand the information security regulations, mandates, and requirements that they will be subject to under the contract or task order.</P>

              <P>(d) GSA's Office of the Senior Agency Information Security Officer issued CIO IT Security Procedural Guide 09-48, “Security Language for Information Technology Acquisitions Efforts,” to provide IT security standards, policies and reporting requirements that shall be inserted in all solicitations and contracts or task orders where an information system is contractor owned and operated on behalf of the Federal Government.

                <P>(i) Any such language, provision, or clause is unenforceable against the Government.</P>
                <P>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the commercial supplier agreement. If the commercial supplier agreement is invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.</P>
                <P>(iii) Any such language, provision, or clause is deemed to be stricken from the commercial supplier agreement.</P>
                <P>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification or any other payment by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</P>
                <P>(w) <E T="03">Commercial supplier agreements—unenforceable clauses.</E> When any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to a commercial supplier agreement (as defined in 502.101), the following language shall be deemed incorporated into the commercial supplier agreement. As used herein, “this agreement” means the commercial supplier agreement:</P>
                <P>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, when the end user is an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, the following shall apply:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This agreement is a part of a contract between the commercial supplier and the U.S. Government for the acquisition of the supply or service that necessitates a license or other similar legal instrument (including all contracts, task orders, and delivery orders under FAR Part 12).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">End user.</E> This agreement shall bind the ordering activity as end user but shall not operate to bind a Government employee or <PRTPAGE P="214"/>person acting on behalf of the Government in his or her personal capacity.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Law and disputes.</E> This agreement is governed by Federal law.</P>
                <P>(A) Any language purporting to subject the U.S. Government to the laws of a U.S. state, U.S. territory, district, or municipality, or a foreign nation, except where Federal law expressly provides for the application of such laws, is hereby deleted.</P>
                <P>(B) Any language requiring dispute resolution in a specific forum or venue that is different from that prescribed by applicable Federal law is hereby deleted.</P>
                <P>(C) Any language prescribing a different time period for bringing an action than that prescribed by applicable Federal law in relation to a dispute is hereby deleted.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Continued performance.</E> The supplier or licensor shall not unilaterally revoke, terminate or suspend any rights granted to the Government except as allowed by this contract. If the supplier or licensor believes the ordering activity to be in breach of the agreement, it shall pursue its rights under the Contract Disputes Act or other applicable Federal statute while continuing performance as set forth in subparagraph (d) (Disputes).</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Arbitration; equitable or injunctive relief.</E> In the event of a claim or dispute arising under or relating to this agreement, a binding arbitration shall not be used unless specifically authorized by agency guidance, and equitable or injunctive relief, including the award of attorney fees, costs or interest, may be awarded against the U.S. Government only when explicitly provided by statute (e.g., Prompt Payment Act or Equal Access to Justice Act).</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Updating terms.</E> (A) After award, the contractor may unilaterally revise terms if they are not material. A material change is defined as:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Terms that change Government rights or obligations;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Terms that increase Government prices;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Terms that decrease overall level of service; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Terms that limit any other Government right addressed elsewhere in this contract.</P>
                <P>(B) For revisions that will materially change the terms of the contract, the revised commercial supplier agreement must be incorporated into the contract using a bilateral modification.</P>
                <P>(C) Any agreement terms or conditions unilaterally revised subsequent to award that are inconsistent with any material term or provision of this contract shall not be enforceable against the Government, and the Government shall not be deemed to have consented to them.</P>
                <P>(vii) <E T="03">No automatic renewals.</E> If any license or service tied to periodic payment is provided under this agreement (e.g., annual software maintenance or annual lease term), such license or service shall not renew automatically upon expiration of its current term without prior express consent by an authorized Government representative.</P>
                <P>(viii) <E T="03">Indemnification.</E> Any clause of this agreement requiring the commercial supplier or licensor to defend or indemnify the end user is hereby amended to provide that the U.S. Department of Justice has the sole right to represent the United States in any such action, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 516.</P>
                <P>(ix) <E T="03">Audits.</E> Any clause of this agreement permitting the commercial supplier or licensor to audit the end user's compliance with this agreement is hereby amended as follows:</P>
                <P>(A) Discrepancies found in an audit may result in a charge by the commercial supplier or licensor to the ordering activity. Any resulting invoice must comply with the proper invoicing requirements specified in the underlying Government contract or order.</P>
                <P>(B) This charge, if disputed by the ordering activity, will be resolved in accordance with subparagraph (d) (Disputes); no payment obligation shall arise on the part of the ordering activity until the conclusion of the dispute process.</P>
                <P>(C) Any audit requested by the contractor will be performed at the contractor's expense, without reimbursement by the Government.</P>
                <P>(x) <E T="03">Taxes or surcharges.</E> Any taxes or surcharges which the commercial supplier or licensor seeks to pass along to the Government as end user will be governed by the terms of the underlying Government contract or order and, in any event, must be submitted to the Contracting Officer for a determination of applicability prior to invoicing unless specifically agreed to otherwise in the Government contract.</P>
                <P>(xi) <E T="03">Non-assignment.</E> This agreement may not be assigned, nor may any rights or obligations thereunder be delegated, without the Government's prior approval, except as expressly permitted under subparagraph (b) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(xii) <E T="03">Confidential information.</E> If this agreement includes a confidentiality clause, such clause is hereby amended to state that neither the agreement nor the contract price list, as applicable, shall be deemed “confidential information.” Issues regarding release of “unit pricing” will be resolved consistent with the Freedom of Information Act. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, the Government may retain any confidential information as required by law, regulation or its internal document retention procedures for legal, regulatory or compliance purposes; provided, however, that all such retained confidential information will continue to be subject to the confidentiality obligations of this agreement.<PRTPAGE P="215"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) If any language, provision, or clause of this agreement conflicts or is inconsistent with the preceding paragraph (w)(1), the language, provisions, or clause of paragraph (w)(1) shall prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>

                <P>(4) The Contractor's failure to remit the full amount of the CAF within the specified deadline constitutes a contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR Subpart 32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or offsetting payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17, Interest). If the Contractor fails to submit the required sales reports, falsifies them, or fails to timely pay the CAF, these reasons constitute sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for cause.</P>

When option year pricing is based on a formula (e.g., changes in the Producer Price Index or other common standard), option year pricing is automatically considered when evaluating the base year price, as any change in price will be uniformly related to changes in market conditions. All options are therefore considered to be evaluated. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</P>

                <P>(B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</P>
                <P>(C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract.</P>

                <P>(D) For daily products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats <PRTPAGE P="228"/>or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the Contractor making the representation.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Contractor's invoice.</E> The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. Notwithstanding paragraph (g) of the clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, if the Contractor submits hard-copy invoices, submit only an original invoice. No copies of the invoice are required. A proper invoice must include the items listed in subdivisions (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(viii) of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, it shall be returned within 7 days after the date the designated billing office received the invoice (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with a statement of the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. Untimely notification will be taken into account in computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor in the manner described in subparagraph (a)(5) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(i) Name and address of the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(ii) Invoice date. (The Contractor is encouraged to date invoices as close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)</P>
                <P>(iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services preformed (including order number and contract line item number).</P>
                <P>(iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, an extended prices of supplies delivered or services performed.</P>
                <P>(v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment, prompt payment discount terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills or lading.</P>
                <P>(vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).</P>
                <P>(vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</P>
                <P>(viii) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (such as evidence of shipment).</P>
                <P>(ix) While not required, the Contractor is strongly encouraged to assign an identification number to each invoice.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Interest penalty.</E> An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in subdivisions (a)(6)(i) through (a)(6)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.</P>
                <P>(i) A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office.</P>
                <P>(ii) A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.</P>
                <P>(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Computing penalty amount.</E> The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty is prescribed by other governmental authority (e.g., tariffs). This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and it is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice principal payment amount approved by the Government until the payment date of such approved principal amount; and will be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment date. That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period will be added to the approved invoice principal payment amount and will be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period. If the designated billing office failed to notify the Contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed in subparagraph (a)(5) of this clause, the due date on the corrected invoice will be adjusted by subtracting from such date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period. Any interest <PRTPAGE P="229"/>penalty owed the Contractor will be based on this adjusted due date. Adjustments will be made by the designated payment office for errors in calculating interest penalties.</P>
                <P>(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivered the supplies or performed the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does, not however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</P>
                <P>(ii) The following periods of time will not be included in the determination of an interest penalty:</P>
                <P>(A) The period taken to notify the Contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this may not exceed 7 days (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils).</P>
                <P>(B) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(C) For incorrect electronic funds transfer (EFT) information, in accordance with the EFT clause of this contract.</P>
                <P>(iii) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes, or for more than 1 year. Interest penalties of less than $1 need not be paid.</P>
                <P>(iv) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Prompt payment discounts.</E> An interest penalty also shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request from the Contractor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly. The interest penalty will be calculated as described in subparagraph (a)(7) of this clause on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when the Contractor is paid.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Additional interest penalty.</E> (i) If this contract was awarded on or October 1, 1989, a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with subdivision (a)(9)(iii) of this clause, shall be paid in addition to the interest penalty amount if the Contractor—</P>
                <P>(A) Is owed an interest penalty of $1 or more;</P>
                <P>(B) Is not paid the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and</P>
                <P>(C) Makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with subdivision (a)(9)(ii) of this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid.</P>
                <P>(ii)(A) Contractors shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. No additional data shall be required. Contractors shall—</P>
                <P>(1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;</P>
                <P>(2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest was due; and</P>
                <P>(3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.</P>
                <P>(B) Demands must be postmarked on or before the 40th day after payment was made, except that—</P>
                <P>(1) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent, the demand must have been received and annotated with the date of receipt by the designated payment office on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or</P>
                <P>(2) If the postmark is illegible or nonexistent and the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the demand's validity will be determined by the date the Contractor has placed on the demand; provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.</P>
                <P>(iii)(A) The additional penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of any original late payment interest penalty, except—</P>
                <P>(1) The additional penalty shall not exceed $5,000;</P>
                <P>(2) The additional penalty shall never be less than $25; and</P>
                <P>(3) No additional penalty is owed if the amount of the underlying interest penalty is less than $1.</P>
                <P>(B) If the interest penalty ceases to accrue in accordance with the limits stated in subdivision (a)(5)(iii) of this clause, the amount of the additional penalty shall be calculated on the amount of interest penalty that would have accrued in the absence of these limits, subject to the overall limits on the additional penalty specified in subdivision (a)(7)(iii)(A) of this clause.</P>

                <P>(C) For determining the maximum and minimum additional penalties, the test shall <PRTPAGE P="230"/>be the interest penalty due on each separate payment made for each separate contract. The maximum and minimum additional penalty shall not be based upon individual invoices unless the invoices are paid separately. Where payments are consolidated for disbursing purposes, the maximum and minimum additional penalty determination shall be made separately for each contract therein.</P>
                <P>(D) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Contract financing payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Due dates for recurring financing payments.</E> If this contract provides for contract financing, requests for payment shall be submitted to the designated billing office as specified in this contract or as directed by the Contracting Officer. Contract financing payments shall be made on the [insert day as prescribed by Agency head; if not prescribed, insert 30th day] day after receipt of a proper contract financing request by the designated billing office. In the event that an audit or other review of a specific financing request is required to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the due date specified.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Due dates for other contract financing.</E> For advance payments, loans, or other arrangements that do not involve recurring submissions of contract financing requests, payment shall be in accordance with the corresponding contract terms or as directed by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Interest penalty not applicable.</E> Contract financing payments shall not be assessed an interest penalty for payment delays.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Fast payment procedure due dates.</E> If this contract contains the clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.</P>

                <P>When any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to a commercial supplier agreement (as defined in 502.101), the following language shall be deemed incorporated into the commercial supplier agreement. As used herein, “this agreement” means the commercial supplier agreement:</P>
                <P>(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, when the end user is an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, the following shall apply:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This agreement is part of a contract between the commercial supplier and the U.S. Government for the acquisition of the supply or service that necessitates a license or other similar legal instrument (including all contracts, task orders, and delivery orders under FAR Parts 13, 14 or 15).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">End user.</E> This agreement shall bind the ordering activity as end user but shall not operate to bind a Government employee or person acting on behalf of the Government in his or her personal capacity.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Law and disputes.</E> This agreement is governed by Federal law.</P>
                <P>(i) Any language purporting to subject the U.S. Government to the laws of a U.S. state, U.S. territory, district, or municipality, or foreign nation, except where Federal law expressly provides for the application of such laws, is hereby deleted.</P>
                <P>(ii) Any language requiring dispute resolution in a specific forum or venue that is different from that prescribed by applicable Federal law is hereby deleted.</P>
                <P>(iii) Any language prescribing a different time period for bringing an action than that prescribed by applicable Federal law in relation to a dispute is hereby deleted.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Continued performance.</E> The supplier or licensor shall not unilaterally revoke, terminate or suspend any rights granted to the Government except as allowed by this contract. If the supplier or licensor believes the ordering activity to be in breach of the agreement, it shall pursue its rights under the Contract Disputes Act or other applicable Federal statute while continuing performance as set forth in FAR 52.233-1, Disputes.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Arbitration; equitable or injunctive relief.</E> In the event of a claim or dispute arising under or relating to this agreement, a binding arbitration shall not be used unless specifically authorized by agency guidance, and equitable or injunctive relief, including the award of attorney fees, costs or interest, may be awarded against the U.S. Government only when explicitly provided by statute (e.g., Prompt Payment Act or Equal Access to Justice Act).</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Updating terms.</E> (i) After award, the contractor may unilaterally revise terms if they are not material. A material change is defined as:</P>
                <P>(A) Terms that significantly change Government rights or obligations; and</P>
                <P>(B) Terms that increase Government prices;</P>

                <P>(8) <E T="03">Indemnification.</E> Any clause of this agreement requiring the commercial supplier or licensor to defend or indemnify the end user is hereby amended to provide that the U.S. Department of Justice has the sole right to represent the United States in any such action, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 516.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Audits.</E> Any clause of this agreement permitting the commercial supplier or licensor to audit the end user's compliance with this agreement is hereby amended as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) Discrepancies found in an audit may result in a charge by the commercial supplier or licensor to the ordering activity. Any resulting invoice must comply with the proper invoicing requirements specified in the underlying Government contract or order.</P>
                <P>(ii) This charge, if disputed by the ordering activity, will be resolved through the Disputes clause at FAR 52.233-1; no payment obligation shall arise on the part of the ordering activity until the conclusion of the dispute process.</P>
                <P>(iii) Any audit requested by the contractor will be performed at the contractor's expense, without reimbursement by the Government.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Taxes or surcharges.</E> Any taxes or surcharges which the commercial supplier or licensor seeks to pass along to the Government as end user will be governed by the terms of the underlying Government contract or order and, in any event, must be submitted to the Contracting Officer for a determination of applicability prior to invoicing unless specifically agreed to otherwise in the Government contract.</P>
                <P>(11) <E T="03">Non-assignment.</E> This agreement may not be assigned, nor may any rights or obligations thereunder be delegated, without the Government's prior approval, except as expressly permitted under the clause at FAR 52.232-23, Assignment of Claims.</P>
                <P>(12) <E T="03">Confidential information.</E> If this agreement includes a confidentiality clause, such clause is hereby amended to state that neither the agreement nor the contract price list, as applicable, shall be deemed “confidential information.” Issues regarding release of “unit pricing” will be resolved consistent with the Freedom of Information Act.

                <P>(a) Reporting of Federal Supply Schedule Sales. The Contractor shall report all contract sales under this contract as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The Contractor shall accurately report the dollar value, in U.S. dollars and rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of all sales under this contract by calendar quarter (January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31). The dollar value of a sale is the price paid by the Schedule user for products and services on a Schedule task or delivery order. The reported contract sales value shall include the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). The Contractor shall maintain a consistent accounting method of sales reporting, based on the Contractor's established commercial accounting practice. The acceptable points at which sales may be reported include—</P>
                <P>(i) Receipt of order;</P>
                <P>(ii) Shipment or delivery, as applicable;</P>
                <P>(iii) Issuance of an invoice; or</P>
                <P>(iv) Payment.</P>
                <P>(2) Contract sales shall be reported to Federal Acquisition Services (FAS) within 30 calendar days following the completion of each reporting quarter. The Contractor shall continue to furnish quarterly reports, including “zero” sales, through physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract.</P>
                <P>(3) Reportable sales under the contract are those resulting from sales of contract items to authorized users unless the purchase was conducted pursuant to a separate contracting authority such as a Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC); a separately awarded FAR Part 12, FAR Part 13, FAR Part 14, or FAR Part 15 procurement; or a non-FAR contract. Sales made to state and local governments under Cooperative Purchasing authority shall be counted as reportable sales for IFF purposes.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor shall electronically report the quarterly dollar value of sales, including “zero” sales, by utilizing the automated reporting system at an internet website designated by the General Services Administration (GSA)'s Federal Acquisition Service (FAS). Prior to using this automated system, the Contractor shall complete contract registration with the FAS Vendor Support Center (VSC). The website address, as well as registration instructions and reporting procedures, will be provided at the time of award. The Contractor shall report sales separately for each National Stock Number (NSN), Special Item Number (SIN), or sub-item.</P>

                <P>(5) The Contractor shall convert the total value of sales made in foreign currency to U.S. dollars using the “Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange” issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Financial Management Service. The Contractor shall use the issue of the Treasury report in effect on the last day of the calendar quarter. The report is available from Financial Management Service, International Funds Branch, Telephone: (202) 874-7994, internet: <E T="03">http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/treasRptRateExch/treasRptRateExch_home.htm.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(b) The Contractor shall remit the IFF at the rate set by GSA's FAS.</P>
                <P>(1) The Contractor shall remit the IFF to FAS in U.S. dollars within 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting quarter; final payment shall be remitted within 30 days after physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract.</P>

                <P>(2) The IFF represents a percentage of the total quarterly sales reported. This percentage is set at the discretion of GSA's FAS. GSA's FAS has the unilateral right to change the percentage at any time, but not more than once per year. FAS will provide reasonable notice prior to the effective date of the change. The IFF reimburses FAS for the costs of operating the Federal Supply Schedules Program. FAS recoups its operating costs from ordering activities as set forth in 40 U.S.C. 321: Acquisition Services Fund. Net operating revenues generated by the IFF are also applied to fund initiatives benefitting other authorized FAS programs, in accordance with 40 U.S.C. 321. Offerors must include the IFF in their prices. The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities. FAS will post notice of the current IFF at <E T="03">https://72a.gsa.gov/</E> or successor website as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(c) Within 60 days of award, an FAS representative will provide the Contractor with specific written procedural instructions on remitting the IFF. FAS reserves the unilateral right to change such instructions from time to time, following notification to the Contractor.</P>

                <P>(d) Failure to remit the full amount of the IFF within 30 calendar days after the end of the applicable reporting period constitutes a contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR Subpart 32.6. The Government may exercise all rights <PRTPAGE P="244"/>under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or setting off payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17, Interest). Should the Contractor fail to submit the required sales reports, falsify them, or fail to timely pay the IFF, this is sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for cause.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General background.</E> The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 requires the Government to evolve its acquisition process from one driven by paper to an expedited process based on electronic commerce/electronic data interchange (EC/EDI). EC/EDI encompasses more than merely automating manual processes and eliminating paper transactions. EC/EDI improves business processes (e.g. procurement, finance, logistics) into a fully electronic environment and fundamentally changes the way organizations operate.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Trading partners and Value-Added Networks (VAN's).</E>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Within the electronic commerce architecture, electronic documents (e.g., orders, invoices, etc.) are carried between the Federal Government's procuring office and Contractors (now known as “trading partners”). These transactions are carried by commercial telecommunications companies called Value-Added Networks (VAN's).</P>
                <P>(2) EDI can be performed using commercially available hardware, software, and telecommunications. The selection of a VAN is a business decision Contractors must make. There are many different VAN's which provide a variety of electronic services and different pricing strategies. If the VAN only provides communications services, you may also need a software translation package.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Registration instructions.</E> To perform EDI with the Government, Contractors shall register as a trading partner. Contractors will provide regular business information, banking information, and EDI capabilities to all agencies in this single registration. A central repository of all trading partners is the Systems for Award Management (SAM) <E T="03">http://www.sam.gov.</E> Contractors shall follow the instructions on the SAM website regarding how to register for EDI.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Implementation conventions.</E> All EDI transactions must comply with the Federal Implementation Conventions (ICs). The ICs are available on a registry maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is accessible via the INTERNET at <E T="03">http://www.nist.gov/itl.</E> ICs are available for common business documents such as Purchase Order, Price Sales Catalog, Invoice, Request for Quotes, etc.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional information.</E> GSA has additional information available for Contractors who are interested in using EC/EDI on its website, <E T="03">www.gsa.gov</E>.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General background.</E> (1) The General Services Administration (GSA) established the “Identity and Access Management Services” (IAMS) Program to clearly define the kinds of digital certificates and PKI services that meet the requirements for service providers and supplies that support FISMA-compliant IAM systems deployed by Federal agencies.</P>
                <P>(2) Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), “Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors” establishes the requirement for a mandatory Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees and Contractor employees assigned to Government contracts in order to enhance security, increase Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy. Further, the Directive requires the Department of Commerce to promulgate a Federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification within six months of the date of the Directive. As a result, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2: Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors August 2013. FIPS 201-2 requires that the digital certificates incorporated into the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) identity credentials comply with the X.509 Certificate Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework. In addition, FIPS 201-2 requires that Federal identity badges referred to as PIV credentials, issued to Federal employees and Contractors comply with the Standard and associated NIST Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, 800-78, and 800-79.</P>

To support the government-wide implementation of HSPD-12 and the Federal e-Authentication Initiative, GSA has established Special Item Numbers (SINs) pertaining to Authentication Products and Services, including Electronic Credentials, Digital Certificates, eAuthentication, Identify and Access Management, PKI Shared Service Providers, and HSPD-12 Product and Service Components.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Qualification information.</E> (1) All Authentication supplies and services must be qualified as being compliant with Government-wide requirements before they will be included on a GSA Information Technology (IT) Schedule contract. The Qualification Requirements and associated evaluation procedures against the Qualification Requirements for each SIN and the specific Qualification Requirements for HSPD-12 implementation components are presented at the following URL: <E T="03">http://www.idmanagement.gov.</E>

Likewise, a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), although not a contract, is an agreement that may be entered into by the Contractor with such an entity and the Federal Government is not a party.</P>
                <P>(2) Where contract clauses refer to action by a Contracting Officer or a Contracting Officer of GSA, that shall mean the individual responsible for placing the order for the ordering activity (e.g., FAR 52.212-4 at paragraph (f) and FSS clause I-FSS-249 B.)</P>
                <P>(3) As a condition of using this contract, eligible ordering activities agree to abide by all terms and conditions of the Schedule contract, except for those deleted clauses or portions of clauses mentioned in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause. Ordering activities may include terms and conditions required by statute, ordinance, regulation, order, or as otherwise allowed by State and local government entities as a part of a statement of work (SOW) or statement of objective (SOO) to the extent that these terms and conditions do not conflict with the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract. The ordering activity and the Contractor expressly acknowledge that, in entering into an agreement for the ordering activity to purchase goods or services from the Contractor, neither the ordering activity nor the Contractor will look to, primarily or in any secondary capacity, or file any claim against the United States or any of its agencies with respect to any failure of performance by the other party.</P>
                <P>(4) The ordering activity is responsible for all payments due the Contractor under the contract formed by acceptance of the ordering activity's order, without recourse to the agency of the U.S. Government, which awarded the Schedule contract.</P>
                <P>(5) The Contractor is encouraged, but not obligated, to accept orders from such entities. The Contractor may, within 5 days of receipt of the order, decline to accept any order, for any reason. The Contractor shall fulfill orders placed by such entities, which are not declined within the 5-day period.</P>
                <P>(6) The supplies or services purchased will be used for governmental purposes only and will not be resold for personal use. Disposal of property acquired will be in accordance with the established procedures of the ordering activity for the disposal of personal property.</P>
                <P>(b) If the Schedule Contractor accepts an order from an entity identified in paragraph (d) of the clause at 552.238-113, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities), the Contractor agrees to the following conditions:</P>

                <P>(1) The ordering activity is responsible for all payments due the Contractor for the contract formed by acceptance of the order, without recourse to the agency of the U.S. Government, which awarded the Schedule contract.<PRTPAGE P="261"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor is encouraged, but not obligated, to accept orders from such entities.

The Contractor shall fulfill orders placed by such entities, which are not declined within the 5-day period.</P>
                <P>(c) In accordance with clause 552.238-80, Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting, the Contractor must report the quarterly dollar value of all sales under this contract. When submitting sales reports, the Contractor must report two dollar values for each Special Item Number:</P>
                <P>(1) The dollar value for sales to entities identified in paragraph (a) of the clause at 552.238-113, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities), and</P>

                <P>(2) Order-level materials are included in the definition of the term “material” in FAR clause 52.212-4 Alternate I, and therefore all provisions of FAR clause 52.212-4 Alternate I that apply to “materials” also apply to order-level materials. The ordering activity shall follow procedures under the Federal Travel Regulation and FAR Part 31 when order-level materials include travel.</P>
                <P>(3) Order-level materials shall only be acquired in direct support of an individual task or delivery order and not as the primary basis or purpose of the order.</P>

                <P>(A) One of these three quotes may include materials furnished by the contractor under FAR 52.212-4 Alt I (i)(1)(ii)(A).</P>
                <P>(B) If the contractor cannot obtain three quotes, the contractor shall maintain its documentation of why three quotes could not be obtained to support their determination.</P>
                <P>(C) A contractor with an approved purchasing system per FAR 44.3 shall instead follow its purchasing system requirement and is exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (d)(7)(i)(A)-(B) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer must make a determination that prices for all order-level materials are fair and reasonable. The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer may base this determination on a comparison of the quotes received in response to the task or delivery order solicitation or other relevant pricing information available.</P>

                <P>(iii) If indirect costs are approved per FAR 52.212-4(i)(1)(ii)(D)(2) Alternate I), the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer must make a determination that all indirect costs approved for payment are fair and reasonable. Supporting data shall be submitted in a form acceptable to the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer.<PRTPAGE P="262"/>
                </P>
                <P>(8) Prior to an increase in the ceiling price of order-level materials, the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer shall follow the procedures at FAR 8.404(h)(3)(iv).</P>
                <P>(9) In accordance with GSAR clause 552.238-83, Examination of Records by GSA, GSA has the authority to examine the Contractor's records for compliance with the pricing provisions in FAR clause 52.212-4 Alternate I, to include examination of any books, documents, papers, and records involving transactions related to the contract for overbillings, billing errors, and compliance with the IFF and the Sales Reporting clauses of the contract.</P>
                <P>(10) OLMs are exempt from the following clauses:</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Equitable Adjustments (MAR 2019)</HD>
                <P>(a) This clause governs the determination of equitable adjustments to which the Contractor may be entitled under the “Changes” clause prescribed by FAR 52.243-4, the “Changes and Changed Conditions” clause prescribed by FAR 52.243-5, the “Differing Site Conditions” clause prescribed by FAR 52.236-2, and any other provision of this contract allowing entitlement to an equitable adjustment. This clause does not govern determination of the Contractor's relief allowable under the “Suspension of Work” clause prescribed by FAR 52.242-14.</P>
                <P>(b) At the written request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall submit a proposal, in accordance with the requirements set forth herein, for an equitable adjustment to the contract for changes or other conditions that may entitle a Contractor to an equitable adjustment. If the Contractor deems an oral or written order to be a change to the contract, it shall promptly submit to the Contracting Officer a proposal for equitable adjustment attributable to such deemed change. The proposal shall also conform to the requirements set forth herein.</P>
                <P>(c) The proposal shall be submitted within the time specified in the “Changes”, “Changes and Changed Conditions”, or “Differing Site Conditions” clause, as applicable, or such other time as may reasonably be required by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(d) Proposals for equitable adjustments, including no cost requests for adjustment of the contract's required completion date, shall include a detailed breakdown of the following elements, as applicable:</P>
                <P>(1) Direct costs.</P>
                <P>(2) Markups.</P>
                <P>(3) Change to the time for completion specified in the contract.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Direct costs.</E> The Contractor shall separately identify each item of deleted and added work associated with the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment, including increases or decreases to unchanged work impacted by the change. For each item of work so identified, the Contractor shall propose for itself and, if applicable, its first two tiers of subcontractors, the following direct costs:</P>
                <P>(1) Material cost broken down by trade, supplier, material description, quantity of material units, and unit cost (including all manufacturing burden associated with material fabrication and cost of delivery to site, unless separately itemized);</P>
                <P>(2) Labor cost broken down by trade, employer, occupation, quantity of labor hours, and burdened hourly labor rate, together with itemization of applied labor burdens (exclusive of employer's overhead, profit, and any labor cost burdens carried in employer's overhead rate);</P>
                <P>(3) Cost of equipment required to perform the work, identified with material to be placed or operation to be performed;</P>
                <P>(4) Cost of preparation and/or revision to shop drawings and other submittals with detail set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this clause;</P>
                <P>(5) Delivery costs, if not included in material unit costs;</P>
                <P>(6) Time-related costs not separately identified as direct costs, and not included in the Contractor's or subcontractors' overhead rates, as specified in paragraph (g) of this clause; and</P>
                <P>(7) Other direct costs.</P>
                <P>(f) Marked-up costs of subcontractors below the second tier may be treated as other direct costs of a second tier subcontractor, unless the Contracting Officer requires a detailed breakdown under paragraph (i) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(g) Extensions of Time and Time-Related Costs. The Contractor shall propose a daily rate for each firm's time-related costs during the affected period, and, for each firm, the increase or decrease in the number of work days of performance attributable to the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment, with supporting analysis. Entitlement to time and time-related costs shall be determined as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Increases or decreases to a firm's time-related costs shall be allowed only if such increase or decrease necessarily and exclusively results from the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or recovery of its own time-related costs except to the extent that such change or other condition necessarily and exclusively causes its duration of performance to extend beyond the completion date specified in the contract.</P>
                <P>(3) Costs may be characterized as time-related costs only if they are incurred solely to support performance of this contract and the increase or decrease in such costs is solely dependent upon the duration of a firm's performance of work.</P>
                <P>(4) Costs may not be characterized as time-related costs if they are included in the calculation of a firm's overhead rate.</P>

                <P>(5) Equitable adjustment of time and time-related costs shall not be allowed unless the analysis supporting the proposal complies with provisions specified elsewhere in this <PRTPAGE P="266"/>contract regarding the Contractor's project schedule.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Markups.</E> For each firm whose direct costs are separately identified in the proposal, the Contractor shall propose an overhead rate, profit rate, and where applicable, a bond rate and insurance rate. Markups shall be determined and applied as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) Overhead rates shall be negotiated, and may be subject to audit and adjustment.</P>
                <P>(2) Profit rates shall be negotiated, but shall not exceed ten percent, unless entitlement to a higher rate of profit may be demonstrated.</P>
                <P>(3) The Contractor and its subcontractor[s] shall not be allowed overhead or profit on the overhead or profit received by a subcontractor, except to the extent that the subcontractor's costs are properly included in other direct costs as specified in paragraph (f) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(4) Overhead rates shall be applied to the direct costs of work performed by a firm, and shall not be allowed on the direct costs of work performed by a subcontractor to that firm at any tier except as set forth below in paragraphs (h)(6) and (h)(7) of this clause.</P>
                <P>(5) Profit rates shall be applied to the sum of a firm's direct costs and the overhead allowed on the direct costs of work performed by that firm.</P>
                <P>(6) Overhead and profit shall be allowed on the direct costs of work performed by a subcontractor within two tiers of a firm at rates equal to only fifty percent of the overhead and profit rates negotiated pursuant to paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this clause for that firm, but not in excess of ten percent when combined.</P>
                <P>(7) Overhead and profit shall not be allowed on the direct costs of a subcontractor more than two tiers below the firm claiming overhead and profit for subcontractor direct costs.</P>
                <P>(8) If changes to a Contractor's or subcontractor's bond or insurance premiums are computed as a percentage of the gross change in contract value, markups for bond and insurance shall be applied after all overhead and profit is applied. Bond and insurance rates shall not be applied if the associated costs are included in the calculation of a firm's overhead rate.</P>
                <P>(9) No markup shall be applied to a firm's costs other than those specified herein.</P>
                <P>(i) At the request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide such other information as may be reasonably necessary to allow evaluation of the proposal. If the proposal includes significant costs incurred by a subcontractor below the second tier, the Contracting Officer may require the same detail for those costs as required for the first two tiers of subcontractors, and markups shall be applied to these subcontractor costs in accordance with paragraph (h).</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Proposal Preparation Costs.</E> If performed by the firm claiming them, proposal preparations costs shall be included in the labor hours proposed as direct costs. If performed by an outside consultant or law firm, proposal preparation costs shall be treated as other direct costs to the firm incurring them. Requests for proposal preparation costs shall include the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A copy of the contract or other documentation identifying the consultant or firm, the scope of the services performed, the manner in which the consultant or firm was to be compensated, and if compensation was paid on an hourly basis, the fully burdened and marked-up hourly rates for the services provided.</P>
                <P>(2) If compensation was paid on an hourly basis, documentation of the quantity of hours worked, including descriptions of the activities for which the hours were billed, and applicable rates.</P>
                <P>(3) Written proof of payment of the costs requested. The sufficiency of the proof shall be determined by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(k) Proposal preparation costs shall be allowed only if—</P>
                <P>(1) The nature and complexity of the change or other condition giving rise to entitlement to an equitable adjustment warrants estimating, scheduling, or other effort not reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract award;</P>
                <P>(2) Proposed costs are not included in a firm's time-related costs or overhead rate; and</P>
                <P>(3) Proposed costs were incurred prior to a Contracting Officer's unilateral determination of an equitable adjustment under the conditions set forth in paragraph (o), or were incurred prior to the time the request for equitable adjustment otherwise became a matter in dispute.</P>
                <P>(l) Proposed direct costs, markups, and proposal preparation costs shall be allowable in the determination of an equitable adjustment only if they are reasonable and otherwise consistent with the contract cost principles and procedures set forth in part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 31) in effect on the date of this contract. Characterization of costs as direct costs, time-related costs, or overhead costs must be consistent with the requesting firm's accounting practices on other work under this contract and other contracts.</P>

                <P>(m) If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the Government's interest that the Contractor proceed with a change before negotiation of an equitable adjustment is completed, the Contracting Officer may order the Contractor to proceed on the basis of a unilateral modification to the contract increasing or decreasing the contract price by an amount to be determined later. Such <PRTPAGE P="267"/>increase or decrease shall not exceed the increase or decrease proposed by the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(n) If the parties cannot agree to an equitable adjustment, the Contracting Officer may determine the equitable adjustment unilaterally.</P>
                <P>(o) The Contractor shall not be entitled to any proposal preparation costs incurred subsequent to the date of a unilateral determination or denial of the request if the Contracting Officer issues a unilateral determination or denial under any of the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(1) The Contractor fails to submit a proposal within the time required by this contract or such time as may reasonably be required by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor fails to submit additional information requested by the Contracting Officer within the time reasonably required.</P>
                <P>(3) Agreement to an equitable adjustment cannot be reached within 60 days of submission of the Contractor's proposal or receipt of additional requested information, despite the Contracting Officer's diligent efforts to negotiate the equitable adjustment.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Inspection system and inspection of facilities.</E> (1) The inspection system maintained by the Contractor under the Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price clause (FAR 52.246-2) of this contract shall be maintained throughout the contract period. Unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall comply with all requirements of editions in effect on the date of the solicitation of either Federal Standard 368 or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 9001:2000 (Quality Management Systems—Requirements). A documented description of the inspection system shall be made available to the Government before contract award. At the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, he/she may authorize in writing exceptions to the quality assurance standards identified above. The Contractor shall immediately notify the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) of any changes made in the inspection system during the contract period. As used herein, the term “inspection system” means the Contractor's own facility or any other facility acceptable to the Government that will be used to perform inspections or tests of materials and components before incorporation into end articles and for inspection of such end articles before shipment. When the manufacturing plant is located outside of the United States, the Contractor shall arrange delivery of the items from a plant or warehouse located in the United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) equipped to perform all inspections and tests required by the contract or specifications to evidence conformance therewith, or shall arrange with a testing laboratory or other facility in the United States, acceptable to the Government, to perform the required inspections and tests.</P>
                <P>(2) In addition to the requirements in Federal Standard 368, ISO 9001:2000 or as otherwise approved by the Government, records shall include the date inspection and testing were performed. These records shall be available for (i) 3 years after final payment; or (ii) 4 years from the end of the Contractor's fiscal year in which the record was created, whichever period expires first.</P>
                <P>(3) Offerors are required to specify, in the space provided elsewhere in this solicitation, the name and address of each manufacturing plant or other facility where supplies will be available for inspection, indicating the item number(s) to which each applies.</P>
                <P>(4) The Contractor shall provide the Administrative Contracting Officer ACO with the name(s) of the individual and an alternate responsible for the inspection system. In the event that the designated individual(s) becomes unavailable to oversee the inspection system, the Contractor, within 10 calendar days of such event, shall provide the ACO with the names of the replacement individual(s).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection by the Contractor.</E> The Contractor is required to demonstrate that the supplies in the shipment have been subject to and have passed all inspections and tests required by the contract and meet the requirements of the contract.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Inspection by Government personnel.</E> (1) Although the Government will normally rely upon the Contractor's representation as to the quality of supplies shipped, it reserves the right under the Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price clause to inspect and test all supplies called for by this contract, before acceptance, at all times and places, including the point of manufacture. When the Government notifies the Contractor of its intent to inspect supplies before shipment, the Contractor shall notify or arrange for subcontractors to notify the designated GSA quality assurance office 7 workdays before the date when supplies will be ready for inspection. Shipment shall not be made until inspection by the Government is completed and shipment is authorized by the Government.<PRTPAGE P="268"/>

Samples selected for testing will be disposed of as follows: Samples from an accepted lot, not damaged in the testing process, will be returned promptly to the Contractor after completion of tests. Samples damaged in the testing process will be disposed of as requested by the Contractor. Samples from a rejected lot will be returned to the Contractor or disposed of in a time and manner agreeable to both the Contractor and the Government.</P>

The Contractor shall remove, at its own expense, supplies rejected or required to be replaced, repaired, or corrected. When the nature of the defect affects an entire batch or lot of supplies, and the Contracting Officer determines that correction can best be accomplished by retaining the nonconforming supplies, and reducing the contract price by an equitable amount under the circumstances, then the equitable price adjustment shall apply to the entire batch or lot of supplies from which the nonconforming item was taken.</P>
                <P>(2) The Contractor may be issued a Quality Deficiency Notice (QDN) if:</P>
                <P>(i) Supplies in process, shipped, or awaiting shipment to fill Government orders are found not to comply with contract requirements, or (ii) deficiencies in either plant quality or process controls are found. Upon receipt of a QDN, the Contractor shall take immediate corrective action and shall suspend shipment of the supplies covered by the QDN until such time as corrective action has been completed. The Contractor shall notify the Government representative, within 5 workdays, of the action plan or the corrective action taken. The Government may elect to verify the corrective action at the Contractor location(s). Shipments of nonconforming supplies will be returned at the Contractor's expense and may constitute cause for termination of the contract. Delays due to the insurance of a QDN do not constitute excusable delay under the default clause of this contract. Failure to complete corrective action in a timely manner may result in termination of the contract.</P>
                <P>(3) This contract may be terminated for default if subsequent Government inspection discloses that plant quality or process controls are not being maintained, supplies that do not meet the requirements of the contract are being shipped, or if the contractor fails to comply with any other requirement of this clause.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional cost for inspection and testing.</E> The Contractor shall be charged for any additional cost of inspection/testing or reinspecting/retesting supplies for the reasons stated in paragraph (e) of FAR 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price. When inspection or testing is performed by or under the direction of GSA, charges will be at the rate of $____**____ per man-hour or fraction thereof if the inspection is at a GSA distribution center; $____**____ per man-hour or fraction thereof, plus travel costs incurred, if the inspection is at any other location; and $____**____ per man-hour or fraction thereof for laboratory testing, except that when a testing facility other than a GSA laboratory performs all or part of the required tests, the Contractor shall be assessed the actual cost incurred by the Government as a result of testing at such facility. When inspection is performed by or under the direction of any agency other than GSA, the charges indicated above may be used, or the agency may assess the actual cost of performing the inspection and testing.<PRTPAGE P="269"/>

In addition to the remedies provided in FAR 52.246-2, supplies may be—</P>
                <P>(1) Stored and charged against the Contractor's account;</P>
                <P>(2) Reshipped to the Contractor at its expense (any additional expense incurred by the Government or the freight carrier caused by the refusal of the Contractor to accept their return shall also be charged against the Contractor's account);</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this provision—</P>
                <P>“Discussions” are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.</P>
                <P>“<E T="03">In writing, writing or written”</E> means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information.</P>
                <P>“Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.</P>
                <P>“Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result or of negotiations.</P>
                <P>“Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendments to solicitations.</E> If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any <PRTPAGE P="272"/>amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.</E> (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages. Offers must be:</P>
                <P>(i) Submitted on the forms prescribed and furnished by the Government as a part of this solicitation or on copies of those forms, and</P>
                <P>(ii) Signed. The person signing an offer must initial each erasure or change appearing on any offer form. If the offeror is a partnership, the names of the partners composing the firm must be included with the offer.</P>
                <P>(2) Late proposals and revisions. (i) The Government will not consider any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers unless it is received before the Government makes award and it meets at least one of the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(A) It was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of offers (e.g., an offer submitted in response to solicitation requiring receipt of offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th).</P>
                <P>(B) It was sent by mail (or telegram or facsimile, if authorized) or hand-carried (including delivery by a commercial carrier) if it is determined by the Government that the late receipt was due primarily to Government mishandling after receipt at the Government installation.</P>
                <P>(C) It was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term “working days” excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.</P>
                <P>(D) It was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation and was received at the initial point of entry of the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals.</P>
                <P>(E) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the activity designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers, and that the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the procurement.</P>
                <P>(F) It is the only proposal received.</P>
                <P>(ii) Any modification or revision of a proposal or response to request for information, including any final proposal revision, is subject to the same conditions as in subparagraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (c)(2)(i)(E) of this provision.</P>
                <P>(iii) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal or modification or revision sent either by registered or certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal, response to a request for information, or modification or revision shall be processed as if mailed late. “Postmark” means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, offerors or respondents should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.</P>
                <P>(iv) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</P>
                <P>(v) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late offer, modification or revision, or withdrawal sent by Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the “Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee” label and the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service, “Postmark” has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service. Therefore, offerors or respondents should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.</P>
                <P>(vi) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this provision, a late modification or revision of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</P>

                <P>(vii) An offeror may withdraw its proposal by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, an offeror may withdraw its proposal via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision entitled “Facsimile Proposals.” Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative's <PRTPAGE P="273"/>identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.</P>
                <P>(viii) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office.</P>
                <P>(3) Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning this solicitation will be furnished promptly to all other prospective offerors, if that information is necessary in submitting offers or if the lack of it would be prejudicial to any other prospective offeror.</P>
                <P>(4) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.</P>
                <P>(5) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.</P>
                <P>(6) The Government will construe an offer to be in full and complete with this solicitation unless the offer describes any deviation in the offer.</P>
                <P>(7) Offerors may submit proposals that depart from stated requirements. Such a proposal shall clearly identify why the acceptance of the proposal would be advantageous to the Government. The proposal must clearly identify and explicitly define any deviations from the terms and conditions of the solicitation, as well as the comparative advantage to the Government. The Government reserves the right to amend the solicitation to allow all offerors an opportunity to submit revised proposals based on the revised requirements.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Restriction on disclosure and use of data.</E> An offeror that includes in its proposal data that it does not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or use by the Government except for evaluation purposes, must meet both of the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:</P>
                <P>This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed—in whole or in part—for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a lease is awarded to this offeror as a result of—or in connection with—the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets].</P>
                <P>(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:</P>
                <P>Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Lease award.</E> (1) The Government intends to award a lease resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.</P>
                <P>(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest.</P>
                <P>(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.</P>
                <P>(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a lease after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.</P>
                <P>(5) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.</P>
                <P>(6) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the price proposed are materially unbalanced between line terms or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understand as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</P>
                <P>(7) The execution and delivery of the Lease contract by the Government establishes a valid award and contract.</P>
                <P>(8) The Government may disclose the following information in postaward debriefings to other offerors:</P>

                <P>(i) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful offeror;<PRTPAGE P="274"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) The overall making of all offerors, when any making was developed by the agency during source selection; and</P>

                <P>(1) The Government's aggregate rent, estimated real estate tax, and operating cost adjustments for the firm term and all option terms of its replacement lease or leases, in excess of the aggregate rent and estimated real estate tax and operating cost adjustments for the term.

The Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of delay. If the facts warrant, the Contracting Officer shall extend the delivery date, to the extent of such delay at no additional costs to the Government.

                <P>The Government will make payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. Payment shall be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or an electronic funds transfer is made. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified.</P>

                <P>(i) When the date for commencement of rent falls on the 15th day of the month or earlier, the initial monthly rental payment under this contract shall become due on the first workday of the month following the month in which the commencement of the rent is effective.</P>

                <P>(ii) When the date for commencement of rent falls after the 15th day of the month, <PRTPAGE P="284"/>the initial monthly rental payment under this contract shall become due on the first workday of the second month following the month in which the commencement of the rent is effective.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Other payments.</E> The due date for making payments other than rent shall be the later of the following two events:</P>
                <P>(i) The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(ii) The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or service. However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt, the invoice payment due date shall be deemed to be the 30th day after the Contractor's invoice is dated, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Invoice and inspection requirements for payments other than rent.</E> (1) The Contractor shall prepare and submit an invoice to the designated billing office after completion of the work. A proper invoice shall include the following items:</P>
                <P>(i) Name and address of the Contractor.</P>
                <P>(ii) Invoice date.</P>

                <P>(2) The Government will inspect and determine the acceptability of the work performed or services delivered within seven days after the receipt of a proper invoice or notification of completion of the work or services unless a different period is specified at the time the order is placed. If actual acceptance occurs later, for the purpose of determining the payment due date and calculation of interest, acceptance will be deemed to occur on the last day of the seven day inspection period. If the work or service is rejected for failure to conform to the technical requirements of the contract, the seven days will be counted beginning with receipt of a new invoice or notification. In either case, the Contractor is not entitled to any payment or interest unless actual acceptance by the Government occurs.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Interest Penalty.</E> (1) An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the Government, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date.</P>

                <P>(2) The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date. This rate is referred to as the “Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,” and it is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the payment amount approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the payment date.</P>
                <P>(3) Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes, or for more than one year. Interest penalties of less than $1.00 need not be paid.</P>
                <P>(4) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Overpayments.</E> If the Lessor becomes aware of a duplicate payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a payment, the Contractor shall—</P>
                <P>(1) Return the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the—</P>

              <P>(a) The contracting officer anticipates that the lease will involve the design and construction of a building, facility, or work for lease to the Government.</P>
              <P>(b) The contracting officer determines whether the procedures are appropriate for entering into a lease construction contract based on the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The contracting officer expects to receive three or more offers.</P>
              <P>(2) Offerors will need to perform design work before developing a price.</P>
              <P>(3) Offerors will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing offers.</P>
              <P>(4) The contracting officer considers criteria such as the following:</P>

              <P>(a) If a proposed acquisition is not exempt under FAR 5.202 or GSAR <PRTPAGE P="289"/>570.106(e), and is for a leasehold interest in real property estimated to exceed 10,000 square feet, then the contracting officer must publicize the proposed acquisition in <E T="03">http://www.FBO.gov.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(b) For leasehold acquisitions where the solicitation requires the construction of a new building on a preselected site, the contracting officer, in accordance with the timeframes established in FAR 5.203, must publicize the proposed acquisition in <E T="03">http://www.FBO.gov</E> regardless of size or value.</P>

              <P>(c) For leasehold acquisitions not subject to a square foot measurement (e.g., antennas, piers, parking), contracting officers must publicize the proposed acquisition in <E T="03">http://www.FBO.gov</E> when the contract action is expected to exceed $25,000, unless an exception under FAR 5.202 applies.</P>

              <P>(d) Other than as identified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the contracting officer need not publicize the proposed acquisition of a leasehold interest in real property, including expansion requests within the scope of a lease (see 570.403), lease extensions under the conditions defined in 570.405, and building alterations within the scope of a lease (see 570.5). However, the contracting officer may publicize proposed lease acquisitions of any dollar value or square footage in <E T="03">http://www.FBO.gov</E> or local newspapers if, in the opinion of the contracting officer, doing so is necessary to promote competition.</P>
              <P>(e) The contracting officer may issue a consolidated advertisement for multiple leasing actions.</P>

              <P>(f) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where publicizing of the proposed acquisition is required, the notice shall be published in <E T="03">http://www.FBO.gov</E> not less than three calendar days prior to issuance of a solicitation.</P>
              <P>(g) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and as set forth in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, the contracting officer shall provide offerors not less than 20 calendar days between solicitation issuance and the date established for receipt of initial offers.</P>
              <P>(1) For a proposed acquisition using simplified lease acquisition procedures (see 570.2), consider the individual acquisition and establish a reasonable response time.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases of unusual and compelling urgency (FAR 6.303-2), provide as much time as reasonably possible under the circumstances and document the contract file.</P>
              <P>(h) If a Member of Congress has specifically requested notification of award, the contracting officer must provide award notifications in accordance with 505.303.</P>

              <P>(1) The notice would disclose the occupant agency's needs and the disclosure of such needs would compromise the national security; or</P>
              <P>(2) The lease—</P>
              <P>(i) Is for an amount not greater than the simplified lease acquisition threshold;</P>

              <P>(ii) Was made through a means where access to the notice of proposed lease action was provided through <E T="03">http://www.FBO.gov;</E> and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deviations to provisions and clauses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The contracting officer needs a deviation approved under Subpart 501.4 to omit any required provision or clause.</P>
              <P>(b) The contracting officer also needs an approved deviation to modify the language of a provision or clause mandated by statute (e.g., FAR 52.215-2, Audit and Records—Negotiation). The authorizing statute must allow for a waiver.</P>
              <P>(c) Certain clauses required by non-GSA regulations require approval of the issuing agency before the contracting officer can delete or modify them. For example, FARs 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; and 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, require the approval of the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs before they can be deleted from or modified in the SFO or lease.</P>

              <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget before collecting information from ten (10) or more members of the public.

              <P>(a) The FAR and the DOSAR apply to all DOS acquisitions of personal property and services, including construction, both within and outside the United States, unless expressly excluded by this subpart, or exempt from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 474(7)), or undertaken pursuant to section 208 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4308), or the Foreign Service Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 292 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

              <P>(a) The DOSAR is issued as Chapter 6 of Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations. The DOSAR is established as Chapter 6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations System. The DOSAR is divided into the same parts, subparts, sections, subsections, and paragraphs as is the FAR. However, when the FAR coverage is adequate by itself there will be no corresponding DOSAR coverage. Where the DOSAR implements a specific part, subpart, section, or subsection of the FAR, the DOSAR coverage is numbered and titled to correspond to the appropriate FAR number and title, except that the DOSAR number will include a 6 or 60 such that there will always be three numbers to the left of the decimal. For example, the DOSAR implementation of FAR 14.1 is shown as 614.1 and the DOSAR implementation of FAR 1.301 is shown as 601.301. Materials that supplement the FAR are assigned the numbers 70 and up. For example, DOSAR requires additional definitions than those used in FAR; this supplementary material is provided in 602.101-70.</P>
              <P>(b) The DOSAR and its revisions are published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and in the Code of Federal Regulations, both of which may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Delegations of authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Delegations.</E> As stated in 601.603-3(a), there is no contracting officer authority conferred by virtue of position. Pursuant to 601.602-1(b), the Procurement Executive has designated the following as contracting activities as defined in FAR 2.101. These authorities are not redelegable. In addition, specific individuals are designated as heads of contracting activities (HCAs) (<E T="03">see</E> FAR 2.101):</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Overseas posts.</E> Each overseas post shall be regarded as a contracting activity to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services. The Principal Officer, the Management Officer, or the Supervisory General Services Officer are designated as HCAs; <E T="03">provided,</E> that he/she has a contracting officer's warrant issued by the Procurement Executive. The Procurement Executive (or authorized A/OPE staff) may delegate to a contracting officer, on a case-by-case basis, the authority to award a contract or modification which exceeds the contracting officer's warrant level.</P>
              <P>(i) No authority is delegated to enter into cost-reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redeterminable contracts. Design/build solicitations and contracts may only be entered into with the written approval of A/OPE and OBO. Proposed construction contracts exceeding $500,000 and any related architect-engineer contracts must have prior A/OPE approval.</P>

              <P>(ii) When expressly authorized by a U.S. Government agency which does not have a contracting officer at the post, the officers named in paragraph (a)(1) introductory text of this section may enter into contracts for that agency. Use of this authority is subject to the statutory authority of that agency and any special contract terms or other requirements necessary for compliance with any conditions or limitations applicable to the funds of that agency. The agency's authorization shall cite the statute(s) and state any special contract terms or other requirements with which the acquisition so authorized must comply. In view of the contracting officer's responsibility <PRTPAGE P="308"/>for the legal, technical, and administrative sufficiency of contracts, questions regarding the propriety of contracting actions that the post is required to take pursuant to this authority may be referred to the Department for resolution with the headquarters of the agency concerned.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Office of Logistics Management; Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM).</E> The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies and services, including construction, is delegated to the Director or designee as the HCA.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Foreign Service Institute.</E> The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to Chapter 7, Title I, of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4021 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), is delegated to the Director of the Foreign Service Institute, the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, and the Supervisory Contracting Officer as the HCA.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Office of Foreign Missions.</E> The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to Title II of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), is delegated to the Director, Office of Foreign Missions, and the Administrative Officer as the HCA.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">U.S. Mission to the United Nations.</E> The authority to enter into and administer contracts pursuant to the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C.287), is delegated to the Counselor for Administration as the HCA.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Other delegations.</E> Several DOS offices have been delegated limited procurement authority, although they have not been designated as HCAs. Matters requiring HCA resolution are referred to the A/LM/AQM. These delegations are provided only to warranted contracting officers in the respective offices. They are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Office of Language Services.</E> The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation for interpreting, translating, conference reporting, and related language support and escort services.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Office of Overseas Schools.</E> The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to section 29 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Office of International Conferences.</E> The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR Part 13 and orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation pursuant to section 5, Title I, of the Department of State Basic Authorities Act of 1956, as amended.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.</E> The authority to enter into and administer simplified acquisition transactions under FAR part 13, to enter into and administer contracts over the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $500,000 for non-commercial item acquisitions; up to $6.5 million for the acquisition of commercial items using the simplified acquisition procedures under the Test Program of FAR subpart 13.5; orders against existing contracts up to the maximum ordering threshold or limitation and personal services contracts pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended; and, 48 CFR Chapter 7, Agency for International Development Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR), including any amendments thereto. INL follows the AIDAR guidance for doing personal service contracts. All other contracting actions follow the DOSAR and DoS regulations. These authorities extend to any acquisition performed by any Department of State contracting activity on behalf of INL.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.</E> The authority to enter into and administer 8(a) purchase <PRTPAGE P="309"/>orders and contracts as a third party pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Small Business Administration.</P>

              <P>(8) <E T="03">Regional Procurement Support Offices.</E> The authority to enter into and administer contracts for the expenditure of funds involved in the acquisition of supplies, equipment, publications, and services on behalf of overseas posts is delegated to each Director, Regional Procurement Support Office (RPSO) at the following locations:</P>
              <P>(i) RPSO Frankfurt in conjunction with Consulate General Frankfurt; and</P>
              <P>(ii) RPSO Florida in conjunction with the Florida Regional Center.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Execution of delegated authority.</E> (1) Whenever the contracting officer makes use of the various statutory authorities available to the Department to waive the application of the Federal Acquisition Regulation or laws governing acquisition, such as those provided in the Foreign Assistance Act (22 U.S.C. 2291) or the Foreign Service Buildings Act (22 U.S.C. 294), a written determination of the basis for using the authority must be prepared and included in the file.</P>
              <P>(2) If the statute or current practice of the requiring office does not specify a particular format, use the following format.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> (1) The Government generally is not bound by unauthorized commitments. Unauthorized commitments violate the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, the FAR, the DOSAR, and proper acquisition practice. Therefore, such unauthorized commitments are serious violations that could result in disciplinary action against the transgressor, e.g., withdrawal of a contracting officer's warrant or a Contracting Officer's Representative delegation or collection action.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000. The head of the contracting activity is delegated the authority to serve as the ratifying official for unauthorized commitments not exceeding $1,000, including unauthorized commitments from other agencies where a DOS employee serves as the contracting officer for that action. The head of the contracting activity may refer any actions not exceeding $1,000 to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification if he or she so chooses.</P>
              <P>(ii) Unauthorized commitments exceeding $1,000. All DOS unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 shall be submitted to the DOS Procurement Executive for ratification. Unauthorized commitments in excess of $1,000 from other agencies may be referred to the other agency's representative at post for resolution in accordance with that agency's ratification process.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Claims.</E> Unauthorized contractual commitments that would involve claims subject to resolution under the Contracts Dispute Act of 1978 shall be processed in accordance with FAR subpart 33.2 and subpart 633.2.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Disciplinary action.</E> The Procurement Executive may refer egregious cases of unauthorized commitments to HR/ER for possible disciplinary action in accordance with 3 FAM 4370 or 3 FAM 4540. Examples might include repeated unauthorized commitments knowingly made by an employee; failure to take responsibility for a deliberate unauthorized commitment; or similar reasons. The Procurement Executive may revoke the appointment certificate of any contracting officer who makes an unauthorized commitment. The Procurement Executive may direct a contracting officer to revoke the appointment memorandum of a Contracting Officer's Representative or Government Technical Monitor who makes an unauthorized commitment.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The person who made the unauthorized commitment shall submit all records and documents concerning the unauthorized commitment to the contracting officer assigned the ratification action. That person shall provide a complete written, signed statement of the facts, including why normal acquisition procedures were not followed; a statement justifying a sole source acquisition (Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition) if the unauthorized commitment exceeds $100,000; why and how the vendor was selected; a list of other sources considered; a description of work or products; a statement regarding the status of performance; an estimated or agreed price; certified funding citations; a statement as to why he/she should not be personally liable for the cost, e.g., a public purpose was served and no personal benefit was received; a statement as to whether the individual has ever been responsible for any other unauthorized commitments in the Department of State; and, a statement as to the number of unauthorized commitments processed by the responsible office within the last three calendar years and the circumstances surrounding each of these actions.</P>

              <P>(2) When the person who made the unauthorized contractual commitment <PRTPAGE P="311"/>is no longer available to attest to the circumstances of the unauthorized commitment, an officer from the responsible office shall accomplish the requirements of this paragraph; the statement shall identify the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.</P>
              <P>(3) In addition, a cognizant management official from the office that employed the individual who made the unauthorized commitment at the time the unauthorized commitment was made shall provide a statement detailing actions that he/she will take to ensure that such commitments will not occur again under the same or similar circumstances.</P>
              <P>(4) This statement shall be cleared by the Executive Director of the Bureau that employs (or employed) the person who made the unauthorized commitment.</P>
              <P>(b) The contracting officer assigned the ratification action shall prepare and execute a recommendation to the ratifying official. The contracting officer shall either recommend that the ratifying official approve and ratify the unauthorized commitment; or, disapprove the ratification of the unauthorized commitment.</P>
              <P>(1) The recommendation shall include the facts and circumstances of the unauthorized commitment; the information prescribed in FAR 1.602-3(c)(1) and (c)(3) through (6); and a recommendation to the ratifying official as to whether the unauthorized commitment should be ratified.</P>
              <P>(2) Following the signature of the contracting officer, the recommendation shall include a statement that the ratifying official could have granted authority to enter into a contractual commitment at the time it was made and still has the authority to do so; that the ratifying official hereby ratifies (or disapproves) the unauthorized commitment in the amount specified; and a date and signature block for the ratifying official.</P>
              <P>(c) The information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be supported by factual findings included or referenced in the recommendation.</P>
              <P>(d) The contracting officer shall submit the complete file to the ratifying official. For actions exceeding $1,000, the file shall be submitted through the head of the contracting activity to the Procurement Executive.</P>
              <P>(e) Upon receipt and review of the complete file, if the ratifying official ratifies the unauthorized commitment, the file shall be returned, through the head of the contracting activity if the action exceeds $1,000, to the contracting officer for issuance of the appropriate contractual document(s). If the request for ratification is not justified, the ratifying official shall return the request to the head of the contracting activity (if over $1,000) or to the contracting officer (if under $1,000) with a written explanation for the decision and a recommendation for disposition of the action.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> There is no contracting officer authority conferred upon any DOS employee by virtue of position. The Procurement Executive appoints all DOS contracting officers, in conformance with FAR 1.603-3, with the one exception as noted in paragraph (b) of this section. The contracting officer shall retain the original copy of the Standard Form 1402, Certificate of Appointment, signed by the Procurement Executive.

These temporary appointments shall be executed on the Standard Form 1402, and a copy shall be furnished to A/OPE. The warrant shall contain both a dollar limitation of no more than $100,000 and a specific time period (not to exceed 90 days) during which the warrant is effective.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Non-Federal employees.</E> Only United States Government employees shall be appointed as contracting officers. For acquisitions at $25,000 and below only, this includes locally employed staff (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Foreign Service Nationals and Third Country nationals).

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Personal services agreements.</E> Individuals who may sign personal services agreements (PSAs) are limited to the following:</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Real property leases.</E> The FAR and DOSAR do not apply to leases of real property. A contracting officer certificate of appointment is not required. Authority to sign real property leases is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Domestic real property leases.</E> The General Services Administration has delegated domestic leasing authority to the Department of State's Office of Real Property Management (A/OPR/RPM). This delegation is accomplished on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Real property leases abroad.</E> Authority to sign real property leases abroad is held by the Director/Chief Operating Officer (DIR/COO) of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), through the Secretary of State, under the Foreign Buildings Act of 1926, as amended (22 U.S.C. 292 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).

              <SUBJECT>Contract closeout procedures.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) This section sets forth procedures for closing out contracts awarded using other than simplified acquisition procedures by contracting activities and requirements offices. It is the Department's policy to close out contracts in <PRTPAGE P="317"/>the time frames prescribed by FAR Part 4.</P>
              <P>(b) Contracting activities are responsible for initiating each contract closeout. Contracting activities and requirements offices are jointly responsible for timely compliance with required contract closeout procedures.</P>
              <P>(c) The contract closeout process shall begin as soon as possible after the contract is physically completed, which means that the contractor has delivered the required supplies and the Government has inspected and accepted them, or the contractor has performed and the Government has accepted all services required by the contract, and the base period and any option periods exercised have expired.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Specific procedures.</E> The normal steps for closing out a physically completed contract shall be as follows. These steps are summarized in the Contract Closeout Checklist, which shall be completed by the contracting officer and included in the contract file. The contracting officer shall indicate any items that are not applicable (e.g., patent reports, royalty reports, etc.).</P>

              <P>(1) The contracting officer shall verify that all work under the contract has been completed; obtain the COR's assessment of the contractor's performance; and conduct an initial funds status review, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> determine if the contract has excess funds that should be deobligated by contract modification. Contracting officers shall send a cover memo to the COR, to which should be attached the COR Completion Certificate, the applicable performance evaluation form (depending on whether the contract is for construction (SF-1420), architect-engineering services (SF-1421), or other supplies or services (DS-1771, <E T="03">Contractor Evaluation Statement</E>)); and, a final payment and closeout memorandum. Contracting officers may require CORs to input past performance data directly into the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) as opposed to completing a paper evaluation form (see 642.1503-70).</P>
              <P>(2) After receipt of the COR's response, and the contractor's release, the contracting officer shall send a final payment memo to the office responsible for payment of invoices/vouchers.</P>
              <P>(3) An audit is required for cost-reimbursement contracts over $550,000, unless available data are considered adequate for a reasonableness determination, in which case the contract file shall be documented with the appropriate rationale. Requests for audits, normally by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) in accordance with the agreement DOS has with DCAA to conduct incurred cost audits, shall be submitted through the A/LM/AQM/BOD/QA Audit Team (see 642.101(b)). Cost-reimbursement contracts may be closed after receipt of the audit report and resolution of any issues raised. Quick closeout procedures may be followed, as prescribed in FAR 42.708. The contracting officer may request an audit of any contract, if warranted; however, audits should not be requested if the cost of the audit is likely to exceed potential cost recovery, except where fraud or misrepresentation is suspected.</P>
              <P>(4) The contracting officer shall send a letter to the contractor requesting release of claims, using the appropriate format. In addition, a Contractor Assignment Letter is required for certain contracts. To determine which format is applicable, contracting officers shall refer to the Payments clause in the contract.</P>
              <P>(5) The contracting officer shall reconcile the contract obligations and contractor payments, and then deobligate any excess funds remaining in the contract by issuing a contract modification on a SF-30. Close coordination with the finance office is necessary in order to receive the required information to perform a funds status review.</P>
              <P>(6) The contracting officer shall verify that all relevant documentation is included in the contract file (see 604.803-70).</P>

              <P>(7) Upon completion of 8(a) contracts, the contracting officer shall complete the Small Business Administration's Contract Completion Form within ten (10) days of contract completion. One copy shall be forwarded to SBA, one copy shall be retained in the contract file, and one copy shall be sent to OSDBU.<PRTPAGE P="318"/>
              </P>
              <P>(8) For classified contracts, the contractor is required to return to the Department all classified material received or generated under the contract, or to destroy all classified material, unless retention is requested and authorized by the Department. The contracting officer shall notify DS/PRD/IN of contract completion, final delivery of goods or services or the termination of the classified contract. The contracting officer shall ensure that any classified material contained in the contract file is properly marked and accounted for.</P>
              <P>(9) Closeout documents are available on the Intranet at the A/OPE Web site.</P>
              <P>(e) Contract files that have been closed out shall be retained in accordance with the schedule in FAR 4.805.</P>
              <P>(f) Contract files for contracts using simplified acquisition procedures are considered closed when the contracting officer receives evidence of property/services and final payment. Disposal of such files shall be as prescribed in FAR 4.805.</P>

Competition, including the use of written solicitation, shall be obtained in all cases to the extent feasible. If there are known U.S. firms or firms with U.S. affiliations in local residence capable of supplying the required supplies or services, the contracting activity shall ensure that those firms are included in the source list for the acquisition.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Policy exclusions.</E> GPE waiver authority does not apply to local guard service contracts exceeding $250,000, or any contracts exceeding $5 million. Local guard service contracts that exceed $250,000 and other contracts that exceed $5 million shall be published in the GPE. Option year prices shall be included when computing the applicability of this threshold.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) The Chief, Controls Division, Office of Intelligence Liaison, Directorate for Coordination, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, is responsible for reviewing and certifying on any proposed acquisitions derived from or funded or administered by intelligence community agencies that involve sensitive compartmented information and ensuring that the provisions of Executive Order 13526 and FAR 6.302-6 have been met. The Office Director, Office of Information Security, Security Infrastructure Directorate, Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS/SI/IS) is responsible for reviewing and certifying on all other proposed acquisitions funded by the Department of State that involve national security information and ensuring that the provisions of Executive Order 13256 and FAR 6.302-6 have been met. When disclosure of the Department's needs through full and open competition would compromise national security, the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition shall include the following specific information:</P>
              <P>(i) How national security would be compromised if the Department of State's (or other agencies') needs were disclosed in the GPE;</P>
              <P>(ii) Why the GPE notice cannot be worded in such a manner that national security would not be compromised;</P>
              <P>(iii) Necessity for access to classified information to prepare technical and/or cost proposal and level of security clearance required;</P>
              <P>(iv) Necessity for access to classified information to perform the proposed contract and level of security clearance required;</P>
              <P>(v) Number and value of contracts that the justification covers; and</P>
              <P>(vi) A statement as follows: “I hereby certify that the national security concerns of the referenced acquisition(s) meet the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12958 and FAR 6.302-6”.</P>
              <P>(2) Any acquisition involving national security information shall be publicized in the GPE unless disclosure of the agency's needs would compromise national security.</P>
              <P>(3) The contracting officer is responsible for soliciting offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances. However, given the sensitivity required for acquisitions involving national security information, it is expected that requirements offices will work closely with the contracting officer in maximizing competition.</P>

The justification shall also address potential cost savings in areas such as inventory, operations, training, maintenance, repairs, and administrative and management support. Areas of consideration for potential cost savings shall be supported by detailed estimates as attachments to the justification. Justifications shall specify an effective period, which shall bear a reasonable relationship to the life of the technical equipment. The effective period shall not exceed six years with a review at the end of the first three years. Periodic reviews shall be made during the standardization period to determine whether <PRTPAGE P="325"/>the standardization should be continued, revised or canceled.</P>

              <P>(a) A/LM funds and controls the acquisition of official vehicles required <PRTPAGE P="327"/>by overseas posts. Accordingly, any acquisition of official vehicles by overseas contracting activities must be approved and authorized in advance by A/LM.</P>
              <P>(b) GSA is the mandatory source for U.S. manufactured vehicles acquired in the United States. Purchase requests are submitted by A/LM to GSA on behalf of overseas posts. Overseas posts shall use U.S. manufactured vehicles unless justified as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) Overseas posts may acquire non-U.S. manufactured vehicles only in special cases that are approved in advance. Requests to purchase non-U.S. manufactured vehicles may be justified under the conditions specified in 6 FAM 228.9-3(B)(c). The request shall be submitted to A/LM for approval. If approval is granted to acquire non-U.S. manufactured vehicles from the local economy, overseas posts shall follow the normal procedures in the FAR.</P>
              <P>(d) Standardization of motor vehicles shall follow the procedures in 606.370.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Acquisition of U.S. manufactured vehicles.</E> (1) GSA is the mandatory source for official vehicles purchased in the United States for all Federal agencies. Non-DOS agencies must have a waiver from GSA that allows them to acquire official vehicles from sources in the United States other than GSA, in accordance with the Federal Property Management Regulation, 41 CFR 101-38.104.</P>
              <P>(2) DOS overseas contracting activities shall not obtain GSA waivers or acquire vehicles through GSA or directly from sources in the United States on behalf of other agencies. Requests to acquire vehicles in this manner shall be returned to the requesting agency without action, and the agency instructed to use its own contracting personnel or GSA for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Acquisition from non-U.S. sources.</E> No GSA waiver is required for official vehicles purchased outside the United States from non-U.S. sources. Normal acquisition procedures shall be followed. However, contracting officers should be aware that statutory ceilings apply to the acquisition of passenger vehicles (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> sedans and station wagons) (see P.L. 103-329), so other agencies shall not request that posts acquire vehicles without providing an analysis of how the price compares with this ceiling.</P>

              <P>(3) As deemed appropriate, the debarring official may conduct investigations to supplement the information provided in the referral, or may request investigations by the Office of the Inspector General or other Department office.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisionmaking process.</E> (1) If the contractor does not respond to a debarment notice within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice, the debarring official may put the debarment into effect.</P>
              <P>(2) In response to the debarment notice, if the contractor or its representative notifies the debarring official within 30 days after receipt of the notice that it wants to present information and arguments in person to the debarring official, that official, or a designee, shall chair such a meeting. The oral presentation shall be conducted informally and a transcript need not be made. However, the contractor may supplement its oral presentation with written information and arguments for inclusion in the administrative record.</P>
              <P>(3) Pursuant to FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), the contractor may request a fact-finding proceeding.</P>
              <P>(4) The debarring official shall designate a fact-finding official and shall provide the fact-finding official with a copy of all documentary evidence considered in proposing debarment. Upon receipt of such material, the fact-finding official shall notify the contractor and schedule a hearing date.</P>

              <P>(6) The fact-finding proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with procedures determined by the fact-finding official. The rules shall be as informal as is practicable, consistent with FAR 9.406-3(b). The fact-finding official is responsible for making the transcribed record of the hearing, unless the contractor and the fact-finding official agree to waive the requirement for a transcript.</P>
              <P>(7) The fact-finding official shall deliver written findings and the transcribed record, if made, to the debarring official. The findings shall resolve any facts in dispute based on a preponderance of the evidence presented and recommend whether a cause for debarment exists.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of proposal to debar.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a complete referral and after consulting with the Office of the Legal Adviser, the debarring official shall decide whether to initiate debarment action.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 205a, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), requires Federal agencies to establish implementing guidelines pursuant to metric policy to adopt the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measurements for United States trade and commerce. This section establishes the Department of State's metric conversion guidelines.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to all DOS acquisitions, except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Dual system</E> means the use of both traditional and metric systems. For example, an item is designated, produced and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Hard metric</E> means the use of only standard metric (SI) measurements in specifications, standards, supplies and services.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Hybrid system</E> means the use of both traditional and hard metric values in specifications, standards, supplies and services.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Measurement sensitive</E> means any item having an application or meaning depending substantially on some measured quantity. For example, measurement sensitive items include product <PRTPAGE P="331"/>or performance criteria and standards binding on others, such as emission levels, size and weight limitations, etc.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Metric system</E> means the International System of Units (Le System International d'Unites (SI)) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Metrication</E> means any act that increases metric system use, including metric training and initiation or conversion of measurement sensitive processes and systems to the metric system.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Soft metric</E> means the result of mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents. The physical dimensions, however, are not changed.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Traditional system of weights and measurements</E> means the predominant weight and measurement system currently used in the United States, also referred to as the “inch-pound system.” The traditional system includes such commonly used units as inch, foot, yard, mile, pint, quart, gallon, bushel, ounce (fluid and avoirdupois), pound, degree Fahrenheit, ampere, candela, and second.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> (1) DOS contracting activities shall implement the metric system in a manner consistent with 15 U.S.C. 205a, <E T="03">et seq.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) All DOS contracting activities shall use the metric system in acquisition consistent with security, operations, economic, technical, logistical, training and safety requirements.</P>
            <P>(3) The Department shall encourage industry to adopt the metric system by acquiring commercially available metric products and services that meet the Department's needs whenever practical. Toward this end, solicitations for DOS acquisitions shall:</P>
            <P>(i) State all measurement sensitive requirements in metric terms whenever possible. Alternatives to hard metric are soft, dual and hybrid metric terms. The Metric Handbook for Federal Officials regarding the selection of proper metric units and symbols is available from the National Technical Information Service; and</P>
            <P>(ii) For contracts expected to exceed $500,000 contracting officers shall return to the requirements office all specifications and statements of work that are not expressed in some form of metric terms unless the requirements office has prepared a justification, for the approval of the contracting officer, for the use of non-metric specifications or statements of work. The justification shall be in a format as prescribed by the head of the contracting activity. Option year prices shall be considered when computing the $500,000 threshold.</P>
            <P>(4) Waivers are not required when ordering from Federal Supply Schedules.</P>
            <P>(5) Valid justifications for non-metric specifications or statements of work include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Existing specifications or standards are in inch-pound units, unless conversion of the existing specifications or standards is necessary or advantageous to the Government. Unnecessary retrofit of existing systems with new metric components should be avoided if the total cost of the retrofit, including redesign costs, exceeds $50,000;</P>
            <P>(ii) Metric is not the accepted industry system with respect to a business-related activity; however, soft, hybrid, or dual systems may be used during the transition to hard metric;</P>
            <P>(iii) The use of metric is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.</P>
            <P>(6) The contracting officer shall review and, if acceptable, approve the waiver prior to the release of the solicitation. The waiver shall be placed in the contract file. If the waiver is not approved, the contracting officer shall return it to the requirements office with an explanation for the disapproval.</P>
            <P>(7) The in-house operating metric costs shall be identified. Identification includes, but is not limited to, the cost of metric aids, tools, equipment, training and increased cost to develop metric specifications. All contracting activities and requirements offices shall maintain a record of any costs and/or savings brought about by metric conversion.</P>
            <P>(8) Bulk (loose, unpacked) materials shall be specified and purchased in metric or dual units.</P>

            <P>(9) Measuring devices, shop and laboratory equipment shall be purchased in metric or dual units.<PRTPAGE P="332"/>
            </P>
            <P>(10) Shipping allowances, bills of lading and other shipping documents shall be expressed in metric or dual units.</P>

              <P>On September 18, 2001, the Department of Commerce (DOC) authorized the Department of State to use the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS). This authority expires on October 1, 2006. The Department of Defense has approved the Department's Embassy Security Protection Program (DOSESPP) as a national defense program eligible for the priorities support under the DPAS.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>611.602</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(c)(1) Authority to use the DPAS is limited to the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) The contract or order must be placed with a U.S. firm; and,</P>
              <P>(ii) The contract or order must be in support of the DOSESPP, which consists of work involving the security of overseas posts. The DOSESPP includes a wide range of elements of both physical and technical security, such as:</P>
              <P>(A) New Embassy/Consulate Compound (NEC/NCC) Program. This program involves the construction of new secure Embassies, Consulates, and related facilities, as well as renovations of newly acquired buildings when used as alternatives to the construction of new secure buildings.</P>
              <P>(B) Physical security upgrade. This includes installation of forced entry/ballistic resistant (FE/BR) windows and doors, walls/fences, active anti-ram barriers, bollards (concrete and steel barriers), and related items.</P>
              <P>(C) Forced entry/ballistic resistant (FE/BR) components. This includes doors, windows, and related facilities and items that can provide the necessary time to protect Government personnel from attack.</P>
              <P>(D) Armored vehicles. This includes passenger vehicles with appropriate armoring.</P>
              <P>(E) Entry control and building surveillance equipment. This includes walk-through metal detectors, X-ray equipment, surveillance cameras, explosive detection equipment, and other features to enhance the protection of Government personnel and facilities.</P>
              <P>(2) DOC has assigned the following priority rating to DOSESPP contracts or orders: DO-H8.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>611.603</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(f) Department of State contracting officers are authorized to sign DO-H8 rated contracts or orders. It is the responsibility of the requirements office to determine which contracts or orders should be rated. All contracts with U.S. firms under the DOSESPP will not necessarily need to be assigned a priority rating.</P>
              <P>(g) The contracting officer should place a DO-H8 rating on any contract or order if there is any doubt as to whether a contractor doing work for Embassy security protection will be able to deliver on time. If an unrated contract or order is not completed on time, the contracting officer may modify the contract or order to add the rating; however, the rating shall only be effective for the newly established delivery date, not the original delivery date.</P>

              <P>(1) DOC can provide special assistance to implement the DPAS program in specific cases. For example, the Department may request a higher priority rating, or request that DOC issue a written directive to a contractor that <PRTPAGE P="333"/>is not complying with the DPAS regulations. In addition, although the DPAS program normally applies only to U.S. firms, if the Department has a prime contract with a foreign firm that will be awarding subcontracts with U.S. firms, the Department may request from DOC authorization to place a rating on the prime contract.</P>

              <P>(2) Contracting officers or requirements offices who wish to request special assistance from DOC must complete DOC Form BXA-999, <E T="03">Request for Special Priorities Assistance,</E> and submit it to A/OPE, which will arrange for submission of the request to DOC.</P>

              <P>(b)(2) It is the Department's policy to use the structured approach for profit/fee analysis contained in the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) FAR Supplement (see 48 CFR chapter 3), for acquisitions awarded by domestic contracting activities and RPSOs. This document may be accessed from A/OPE's Acquisition Web site (see 601.105-3). Contracting officers shall follow these procedures. HHS Form 674, <E T="03">Structured Approach Profit/Fee Objective,</E> or an equivalent form, may be used to document the profit/fee analysis. If more than one pre-negotiation cost objective is developed (e.g., high and low), a separate form should be completed for each. The contracting officer shall ensure that a written explanation is attached to the form justifying the weights chosen for each cost category or factor. This approach considers the factors outlined in FAR 15.404-4(d).</P>
              <P>(c)(4)(i)(B) In accordance with a delegation from OBO, overseas posts may request a waiver from A/OPE if post is unable to negotiate a price for architect-engineer services within the six percent price limitation. To obtain a waiver, the contracting officer must send the following information to A/OPE:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Description of project;</P>

              <SUBJECT>The Department of State Mentor-Protégé Program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Mentor-Protégé Program is designed to motivate and encourage firms to assist small businesses with business development, including small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The program is also designed to improve the performance of DOS contracts and subcontracts, foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between small businesses and prime contractors, and increase the overall number of small businesses that receive DOS contract and subcontract awards. The program is limited to non-commercial item acquisitions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The definitions of small business (SB), HUBZone small business concern (HUBZone), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) are the same as found in FAR 2.101.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Mentor</E> means a prime contractor that elects to promote and develop small business subcontractors by providing developmental assistance designed to enhance the business success of the protégé.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Non-affiliation.</E> For purposes of the Small Business Act, a protégé firm is not considered an affiliate of a mentor firm solely because the protégé firm is receiving developmental assistance from the mentor firm under the program.</P>

This authority is limited to negotiated acquisitions.<PRTPAGE P="343"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Before awarding a contract that requires a subcontracting plan, the existence of a mentor-protégé arrangement, and performance, if any, under an existing arrangement, may be considered by the contracting officer in:</P>

              <P>It is the Department's policy to incorporate its current fiscal year goals as negotiated with the SBA into all pertinent Department solicitations, in addition to the standard subcontract clauses. Incorporation of the goals does not require that large prime contractors must subcontract, but does require that to the extent they plan to subcontract, specific goals be established for doing business with small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned small, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms. Where funds are available, an incentive clause such as that found in FAR 52.219-10, Incentive Subcontracting Program, is encouraged.</P>

The Department of State has signed an MOU with SBA, effective May 6, 1998. Under the MOU, a contract may be awarded directly to an 8(a) firm on either a sole source or competitive basis. The SBA reserves the right to withdraw any delegation issued as a result of an MOU; however, any such withdrawal shall have no effect on contracts currently awarded under the MOU.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Overseas workers' compensation and war-hazard insurance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(b)(1) Acquisitions for services, including construction but excluding personal services contracts, requiring contractor personnel to perform work outside of the United States, shall include the contractual obligation for coverage under the Defense Base Act (42 U.S.C. Sections 1651-1654, as amended), for covered contractor employees. For the purposes of this section, “covered contractor employees” includes the following individuals:</P>
              <P>(i) United States citizens or residents;</P>
              <P>(ii) Individuals hired in the United States or its possessions, regardless of citizenship; and,</P>
              <P>(iii) Local nationals and third country nationals where contract performance takes place in a country where there are no local workers' compensation laws.</P>
              <P>(2) Individuals who are self-employed (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, they have not incorporated) do not meet the definition of an employee. No Defense Base Act insurance is required when contracting with these individuals.</P>
              <P>(3) Exceptions are discussed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The authority to recommend a waiver from the Defense Base Act, as set forth in FAR 28.305(d), is reserved to the Secretary of State.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) The Secretary of Labor has waived the applicability of the Defense Base Act to all DOS service contracts, including construction, for contractor employees who are local nationals or third country nationals. This waiver is conditioned on the requirement for the contractor to provide workers' compensation benefits against the risk of work injury or death and assume liability toward the employees and their beneficiaries for war-hazard injury, death, capture, or detention as prescribed by the local workers' compensation laws.</P>
              <P>(2) In cases where a contract is performed in a country where there are no local workers' compensation laws, local and third country national contractor employees are considered to be “covered contractor employees”, and the contractor shall acquire Defense Base Act insurance for those employees pursuant to the contract between the Department of State and the Defense Base Act insurance broker.</P>

              <P>(f)(1) Section 16 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act (22 U.S.C. 2680a), as amended, provides that the Defense Base Act shall not apply with respect to such contracts as the Secretary of State determines are contracts with persons employed to perform work for the Department of State on an intermittent basis for not more than 90 days in a calendar year. The Department of State has established that “persons” includes employees hired by companies under contract with the Department. The Procurement Executive has the authority to issue the waivers for employees who <PRTPAGE P="356"/>work on an intermittent or short-term basis. Waivers may be issued only for employees who are U.S. citizens and residents, and only where the contractor provides evidence of alternative workers' compensation coverage for those employees. Waivers may not be issued for local or third country nationals.</P>
              <P>(2) The contractor shall submit waiver requests to the contracting officer. The request shall contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Contract number;</P>
              <P>(ii) Name of contractor;</P>
              <P>(iii) Brief description of the services to be provided under the contract and country of performance;</P>
              <P>(iv) Name and position title of individual(s);</P>
              <P>(v) Nationality of individual(s) (must be U.S. citizen or resident);</P>
              <P>(vi) Dates (or timeframe) of performance at the overseas location; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Evidence of alternative workers' compensation coverage for these employees (e.g., evidence that the State workers' compensation program covers workers on short-term foreign assignments).</P>
              <P>(3) The contracting officer shall review the request for completeness and accuracy. If the request is complete and accurate, the contracting officer shall forward the request to the Procurement Executive. If the contractor does not provide complete and accurate information, the contracting officer shall return the request to the contractor with an explanation as to what additional information is required.</P>
              <P>(4) The Procurement Executive shall review requests for waiver forwarded by the contracting officer and either approve or disapprove the request. The Procurement Executive shall return the request indicating his/her approval or disapproval to the contracting officer. Any request that is not approved shall describe the reason(s) why the request was not approved. The contracting officer shall provide the contractor with the original of the approved or disapproved document and maintain a copy in the contract file.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> The Department's goal is to resolve contract disputes before the issuance of a contracting officer's final decision under the Disputes statute (41 U.S.C. chapter 71). Contracting officers shall consider all possible means of reaching a negotiated settlement, consistent with the Government's best interests, before issuing a final decision on a contractor claim under the process outlined in FAR 33.206 through 33.211.<PRTPAGE P="361"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When to use ADR</E>—(1) <E T="03">Factors favoring ADR.</E> Contracting officers should consider using ADR in those cases where:</P>
              <P>(i) Only facts are in dispute;</P>
              <P>(ii) The facts are clearly not favorable to the Government;</P>
              <P>(iii) The anticipated costs (in time and money) are less than the anticipated costs of litigation;</P>
              <P>(iv) Settlement attempts have reached an impasse;</P>
              <P>(v) ADR techniques have been used successfully in similar situations;</P>
              <P>(vi) There is a need for independent expert analysis; or,</P>
              <P>(vii) The claim has merit but its value is overstated.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Factors disfavoring ADR.</E> The following circumstances do not favor use of ADR:</P>
              <P>(i) Cases involving disputes controlled by clear legal precedent, making compromise difficult;</P>
              <P>(ii) The resolution will have a significant impact on other pending cases or on the future conduct of Department business;</P>
              <P>(iii) The dispute is primarily over issues of law;</P>
              <P>(iv) A decision of precedential value is needed;</P>
              <P>(v) A significant policy question is involved;</P>
              <P>(vi) A full public record of the proceeding is important;</P>
              <P>(vii) The outcome could significantly involve persons who are not parties to the contract;</P>
              <P>(viii) The costs of pursuing an ADR procedure (in time and money) exceed the cost of litigation;</P>
              <P>(ix) The nature of the case may cause ADR to be used merely for delay or discovery; or,</P>
              <P>(x) The case involves criminal violations.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Initial action.</E> Immediately upon receipt of a claim, the contracting officer shall send a letter acknowledging receipt of the claim and soliciting the contractor's views on submitting this claim for ADR. In every dispute, the first step toward resolution shall be unassisted negotiations, in which the parties try to work out the disagreement among themselves. If this fails, before issuing a final decision, the contracting officer shall consult first with the head of the contracting activity, and contact the Office of the Legal Adviser and A/OPE to determine whether the disagreement appears susceptible to resolution by ADR. Consideration shall be given to pursuing additional fact-finding or designating a neutral expert in the disputed issue to provide an advisory opinion.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Methods of ADR.</E> If the initial action to resolve the dispute fails, and the contracting officer issues a final decision which is appealed, ADR may still be feasible. The CBCA issues a notice regarding ADR to all contractors who file appeals under the Contract Disputes Act. This notice describes the following ADR techniques, which contracting officers are urged to discuss with contractors at any time:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Settlement judge.</E> A settlement judge is either an administrative judge or hearing examiner who is appointed by the parties in dispute for the purpose of facilitating settlement. The agenda is flexible and based on the specifics of the individual dispute. By holding a frank, in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position, the settlement judge may be able to foster a settlement of the dispute. The settlement judge may meet with the parties jointly or individually, and the settlement judge's recommendations are not binding. Typically, the settlement judge's opinions, based on his or her experience in handling prior disputes, will help the parties realize whether their arguments have merit or not.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Minitrial.</E> A minitrial is not an actual trial but rather a flexible, expedited, but structured procedure in which each party presents an abbreviated version of its position both to a neutral advisor (who may be appointed by the CBCA) and to principals of the parties who have full contractual authority to conclude a settlement. The parties mutually decide on the form of presentation without regard to traditional judicial proceedings or rules of evidence. An advance agreement by the parties specifies the procedure to be followed in making presentations, as well as the role of the neutral advisor. Upon conclusion of the presentations, settlement negotiations are conducted. <PRTPAGE P="362"/>The neutral advisor may assist the parties in negotiating settlement, including making non-binding recommendations.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Summary trial with binding decision.</E> A summary trial with binding decision is a procedure in which the scheduling of an appeal is expedited and the parties try their appeal informally before an administrative judge or panel of judges. The length of the trial and the time for presentation and decision are tailored to the needs of the particular case. Trial procedures and rules applicable to appeals are modified or eliminated to expedite resolution of the appeal. The parties must agree, however, that all decisions, rulings, and orders by the judge(s) are final, conclusive, and not appealable, and may not be set aside, except for fraud. A summary “bench” decision is issued at the conclusion of the trial or a summary written decision will be issued within ten (10) days of either the trial's conclusion or receipt of a trial transcript.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Mediation.</E> Mediation is a process in which a neutral and impartial third party assists the Government and the contractor in conflict to negotiate an acceptable settlement of contested issues. The mediator is jointly selected and is asked by the disputing parties to assist them to reach a voluntary agreement. The mediator has no decisionmaking authority and cannot impose a decision. Mediation assistance involves working with the parties to improve their communications, clarify or interpret data, identify key issues to be discussed, design an effective negotiation process, generate settlement options, or help to identify or formulate areas of agreement. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet: <E T="03">http://www.adrr.com</E>
              </P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Arbitration.</E> Non-binding arbitration is a process in which a dispute is jointly submitted by the Government and a contractor to an impartial and neutral person or panel who provides a written, non-binding opinion used as a guide for negotiations toward a settlement. Although the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-552) allows agencies to use binding arbitration, the law provides that the agency head may vacate any arbitration award within 30 days after it is served on all parties. For this reason, non-binding arbitration is preferable. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet: <E T="03">http://www.adrr.com</E>
              </P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Partnering.</E> Partnering involves an agreement in principle to share the risks involved in completing a project, and to establish and promote a partnership environment. Partnering itself is not a contractual agreement and it does not create any legally enforceable rights, but instead partnering seeks to create a new cooperative attitude in completing Government contracts. The three basic steps in partnering are:</P>
              <P>(i) Establish the new relationship through personal contact among the principals for the Government and the contractor before the work begins;</P>
              <P>(ii) Prepare a joint statement of goals establishing common objectives in specific detail for reaching the goals; and,</P>

              <P>(iii) Identify specific dispute prevention processes designed to head off problems, evaluate performance, and promote cooperation. Additional information on alternative dispute resolution and mediation resources is available at the following address on the Internet: <E T="03">http://www.adrr.com</E>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">ADR procedures.</E> The ADR method shall be selected voluntarily by both the Government and the contractor. Both parties shall agree on the procedures to be followed, including the agenda and amount of time allowed for each party to present its case. The parties may choose not to have a written transcript or hearing on the record, as this might inhibit settlement. Also, the decision rendered, if any, should not be considered to establish any precedent for future litigation unless the parties agree otherwise. In cases where the parties agree to pay jointly for a third-party neutral advisor, it is recommended that the parties and the advisor agree on a fair and reasonable price. The Government would then issue a simplified acquisition (if the dollar amount does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold) for 50% of the agreed price, and the advisor would <PRTPAGE P="363"/>submit separate invoices (each for 50% of the price) to the Government and the contractor.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Personal services agreements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies only to personal services agreements (PSAs) awarded under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c).<PRTPAGE P="368"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition.</E> “Personal Services Agreement (PSA)” is a method of employment using the statutory authority under 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). The Procurement Executive has delegated program management responsibility for PSAs awarded under the Department of State basic authority at 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). When applied to U.S. citizens hired under this authority, the term “PSA Plus” is normally used.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Policy.</E> DOS contracting officers at overseas posts should not award any personal services contracts that are subject to acquisition statutes and regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Authority.</E> (1) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995, amended section 2(c) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2669(c)) by revising the Department's authority. This language states: “and such contracts are authorized to be negotiated, the terms of the contracts to be prescribed, and the work to be performed, where necessary, without regard to such statutory provisions as relative to the negotiation, making, and performance of contracts and performance of work in the United States.”</P>
              <P>(2) This authority was further amended under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 which added subsection (n) to 22 U.S.C. 2669. This language states “exercise the authority provided in section (c), upon the request of the Secretary of Defense or the head of any other department or agency of the United States, to enter into personal services contracts with individuals to perform services in support of the Department of Defense or such other department or agency, as the case may be.” This authority allowed the use of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c) by all other agencies, provided they meet certain criteria and agree to follow certain guidelines laid out in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). That MOA is not signed at the post level, but by a senior official at the Department of State and the other agency. Without the MOA in place, other agencies may not use this basic authority. HR/OE has responsibility for implementation of the authority that came with this legislative change. The HR/OE Web site includes the latest listing of agencies that have signed the MOA and can use this authority.</P>
              <P>(3) This statutory language has continuing effect and provides authority to the Department of State, and now other agencies, if they so agree, to obtain personal services without adherence to acquisition statutes. In furtherance of the authority provided by the statute, the Procurement Executive has waived the applicability of acquisition regulations when obtaining personal services under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c). As a result, it is not necessary for the individual executing a PSA under the authority of 22 U.S.C. 2669(c) to have a contracting officer's certificate of appointment required under FAR 1.603 and 601.603 (see 601.603-3(d)).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Signatory authority.</E> Only direct hire U.S. citizens may sign PSAs. Provided the individual meets that criterion, individuals who may sign PSAs are limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The Human Resources Officer;</P>
              <P>(2) The Human Resources/Financial Management Officer; or,</P>
              <P>(3) The Management Officer or American FSO designated to perform human resources functions (e.g., GSO, RSO, etc.).</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Price Adjustment (AUG 1999)</HD>
                <P>(a) The contract price may be increased or decreased in actual costs of direct service labor which result directly from laws enacted and effective during the term of this contract by the [insert name of country] Government. Direct service labor costs include only the costs of wages and direct benefits (such as social security, health insurance, unemployment compensation insurance) paid to or incurred for the direct benefit of personnel performing services under one of the categories listed in Section [identify section number] of this contract. Price adjustments will include only changes in direct service labor costs incurred in order to comply with the requirements of the law. No adjustment will be made under this clause with respect to labor costs of personnel not performing direct service labor under the categories of Section [identify section], nor for overhead, profit, general and administrative (G&amp;A) costs, taxes or any other costs whatsoever.</P>
                <P>(b) For the contracting officer to consider any request for adjustment, the contractor shall demonstrate in writing:</P>
                <P>(1) That the change in the law occurred during the term of this contract and subsequent to the award date of this contract; and,</P>
                <P>(2) That the change in the law could not have been reasonably anticipated prior to contract award; and,</P>
                <P>(3) How the change in the law directly affects the contractor's costs under this contract.</P>
                <P>(c) The contractor shall present data that clearly supports any request for adjustment. This data shall be submitted no later than 30 calendar days after the changes in the law have been made public. This data shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The calculation of the amount of adjustment requested; and,</P>
                <P>(2) Documentation which identifies and provides the appropriate portions of the text of the particular law from which the request is derived.</P>
                <P>(d) In order to establish the change between the requested adjusted rate and the original rate, the contractor shall support the appropriate data and composition of the original rate and the requested adjusted rate. This shall include details regarding specific hourly rates paid to individual employees. For contracts paid in U.S. dollars, the contractor's request for price adjustment shall present data reflecting:</P>
                <P>(1) The exchange rate in effect on the date of the contractor's proposal that was accepted for the basic contract; and</P>
                <P>(2) The current exchange rate and its effect on payment of workers in local currency. The allowable adjustment shall be limited to the extent to which increases in direct service labor costs due to host country law changes are not offset by exchange rate gains.</P>
                <P>(e) Only direct cost changes mandated by enacted laws shall be considered for adjustment under this contract. Changes for purposes of maintaining parity of pay between employees at the minimum mandated levels and employees already paid at levels above the newly mandated minimums shall not be considered. Therefore, if the contractor elects to increase payments to employees who are already being paid at or above the mandated amounts, such increased costs shall be borne solely by the contractor and shall not be justification for an increase in the hourly and monthly rates under this contract.</P>
                <P>(f) Any request for adjustment shall be presented by signature of an officer or general partner of the contractor having overall responsibility for the conduct of the contractor's affairs.</P>
                <P>(g) No adjustment shall be made to the contract price that relates to any indirect, overhead, or fixed costs, profit or fee. Only the changes in direct service labor wages (and any benefits based directly on wages) shall be considered by the U.S. Government as basis for contract price changes.</P>
                <P>(h) No request by the contractor for an adjustment under this clause shall be allowed if asserted after final payment has been made under this contract.</P>
                <P>(i) This clause shall only apply to laws enacted by the [insert name of country] Government meeting the criterion set forth above in paragraph (b). No adjustments shall be made due to currency fluctuations in exchange rates.</P>

                <P>(a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:</P>

                <P>(3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;</P>
                <P>(4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;</P>

                <P>(d) When additional funds are obligated from time to time for continued performance of this contract, the contract shall be modified to increase the funds obligated and to indicate the period of performance for which funds are applicable. The contractor may notify the contracting officer as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause regarding any additional funds obligated.</P>

                  <E T="03">Introduction.</E> Section 402 of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act (Public Law 99-399) provides that a “United States person” or a “qualified United States joint venture” must meet certain requirements, listed in sections 402(c)(2) and (3) of the Act, to be eligible to compete. To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person, guidance is hereby provided. For ease of reference, the statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it. Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.

                  <P>The Statement of Qualifications shall provide information correctly applicable to the U.S. person whose qualifications are being certified, and shall not include information pertaining to corporate affiliates or subsidiaries. Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture. A prospective bidder/offeror may be an individual <PRTPAGE P="386"/>organization or firm, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. firm that guarantees performance. To be considered a “qualified United States joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. By signing this bid/proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</P>

                  <E T="03">Introduction.</E> Section 136 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, Public Law 101-246 (22 U.S.C. 4864), as amended, provides that a “United States person” or a “qualified United States joint venture” must meet certain requirements, listed in the Act, to be eligible for the statutory preference. To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person entitled to preference under Section 136, guidance is hereby provided. Only those prospective offerors submitting a properly completed and certified Volume 5 with their initial proposals will be considered in the determination of eligibility for assignment of preference as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person. For ease of reference, statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it. Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.
                </P>
                <NOTE>
                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                  <P>The Statement of Qualifications shall provide information correctly applicable to the U.S. person whose qualifications are being certified, and shall not include information pertaining to corporate affiliates or subsidiaries. Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of another organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or local, national or offshore organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture. The contract resulting from this solicitation shall not allow subcontracting. A prospective offeror may be a sole proprietorship, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture with no written agreement. To be considered a “qualified joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. joint venture person listed in Section 136. By signing this proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</P>
