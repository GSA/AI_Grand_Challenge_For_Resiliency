      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

The contents of these volumes represent all current regulations codified under this title of the CFR as of October 1, 2019.

      The Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 are those government-wide acquisition regulations jointly issued by the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Chapters 2 through 99 are acquisition regulations issued by individual government agencies. Parts 1 to 69 in each of chapters 2 through 99 are reserved for agency regulations implementing the Federal acquisition regulations in chapter 1 and are numerically keyed to them. Parts 70 to 99 in chapters 2 through 99 contain agency regulations supplementing the Federal acquisition regulations.
      The OMB control numbers for the Federal Acquisition Regulations System appear in section 1.106 of chapter 1. For the convenience of the user section 1.106 is reprinted in the Finding Aids section of the second volume containing chapter 1 (parts 52 to 99).
      The first volume, containing chapter 1 (parts 1 to 51), includes an index to the Federal acquisition regulations.

              (3) The CCOs defined in 1502.100 for purposes of ratification authority only must meet the following criteria:
              (i) Must possess a contracting officer's warrant and be in the 1102 job series;
              (ii) Are prohibited from re-delegating their ratification authority;
              (iii) Are prohibited from approving a ratification if he/she acted as a contracting officer in preparing the determination and findings required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and
              (iv) Must abide by the other limitations on ratification of unauthorized commitments set forth in FAR 1.602-3(c) and the EPAAR.
              (2) The CCOs defined in 1502.100 for purposes of ratification authority only must meet the following criteria:
              (i) Must possess a contracting officer's warrant and be in the 1102 job series;
              (ii) Are prohibited from re-delegating their ratification authority;
              (iii) Must submit copies of ratification actions to the cognizant Office of Acquisition Management Division Director at Headquarters; and
              (iv) As with other ratifying officials, must abide by the other limitations on ratification of unauthorized commitments set forth in FAR 1.602-3(c) and the EPAAR.
              (c) Procedures. (1) The program office shall notify the cognizant contracting office by memorandum of the circumstances surrounding an unauthorized commitment. The notification shall include:
              (i) All relevant documents and records;
              (ii) Documentation of the necessity for the work and benefit derived by the Government;
              (iii) A statement of the delivery status of the supplies or services associated with the unauthorized commitment;
              (iv) A list of the procurement sources solicited (if any) and the rationale for the source selected;
              (v) If only one source was solicited, a justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) as required by FAR 6.302, FAR 6.303, and 1506.303, or for simplified acquisition procedures exceeding the competition threshold in FAR 13.106, a sole source justification as required by 1513.170;

              (2) The Division Director (or equivalent) of the responsible office shall approve the memorandum. If expenditure of funds is involved, the program office shall include a Procurement Request/Order, EPA Form 1900-8, with funding sufficient to cover the action. The appropriation data cited on the 1900-8 shall be valid for the period in which the unauthorized commitment was made.
              (3) Upon receiving the notification, the Contracting Officer shall prepare a determination and findings regarding ratification of the unauthorized commitment for the ratifying official. The determination and findings shall include sufficient detail to support the recommended action. If ratification of the unauthorized commitment is recommended, the determination and findings shall include a determination that the price is fair and reasonable. To document the determination, additional information may be required from the Contractor. Concurrence by the Office of General Counsel is not mandatory, but shall be sought in difficult or unusual cases.

              (4) The ratifying official may inform the Inspector General (IG) of the action by memorandum through the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA). For ratification actions exceeding the small purchase limitation, the ratifying official shall submit a memorandum to the Assistant Administrator for Administration and Resources Management through the HCA for transmittal to the Assistant, Associate, or Regional Administrator (or equivalent level) of the person responsible for the unauthorized commitment. This memorandum should contain a brief description of the circumstances surrounding the unauthorized commitment, recommend corrective action, and include a copy of any memorandum sent to the IG. Submission of a memorandum to the appropriate Assistant, Associate, or Regional Administrator for unauthorized commitments at or below the small purchase limitation is optional and may be accomplished at the discretion of the ratifying official.
              (d) Paid Advertisements. (1) EPA is generally not authorized to ratify improperly ordered paid advertisements. The ratifying official, however, may determine payment is proper subject to the limitations in FAR 1.602-3(c) if the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment acted in good faith to comply with Agency acquisition policies and procedures.
              (2) The paying office shall forward invoice claims received in its office for improper paid advertisements to the cognizant ratifying official for a determination regarding ratification of the action.
              (3) If the ratifying official determines that an unauthorized commitment cannot be ratified by the Agency, the ratifying official shall instruct the submitter to present its claim to the General Accounting Office in accordance with the instructions contained in 4 CFR part 31, Claims Against the United States, General Procedures.
              (e) Payment of Properly Ratified Claims. After the unauthorized commitment is ratified, the Contractor must submit an invoice (or resubmit an invoice if one was previously submitted) citing the appropriate contract or purchase order number.

              (a) Each EPA employee (including special government employees as defined by 18 U.S.C. 202 and 1503.600-71(b)) engaged in source evaluation and selection is required to abide by and be familiar with the conflict of interest statutes codified in Title 18 of the United States Code, as well as the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 CFR part 2635.

              In addition to those procedures set forth in FAR 4.804-5, the contracting office shall, before final payment is made under a cost reimbursement type contract, verify the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness of costs claimed.

Similar verification of actual costs shall be made for other contracts when cost incentives, price redeterminations, or cost-reimbursement elements are involved. Termination settlement proposals shall be submitted to the Financial Analysis and Oversight Service Center for review by the Office of Audit as prescribed by FAR 49.107. All such audits will be coordinated through the cost advisory group in the contracting office. Exceptions to these procedures are the quick close-out procedures as described in FAR 42.708 and EPA Acquisition Guide (EPAAG) subsection 4.8.1.

              Content.
              The documentation requirements in this section apply only to acquisitions processed using other than small purchase procedures. (Refer to 1513.170 for documentation for small purchase acquisitions).
              (a) The initiating office shall prepare a written justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) that documents the facts and circumstances substantiating the infeasibility of full and open competition for each recommended limited sources or sole source acquisition when required by FAR 6.302.
              (b) The recommendation shall be entitled “Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition” and shall be signed at the programmatic Division Director or comparable office level prior to submission with the procurement request. The JOFOC shall contain the information prescribed in FAR 6.303-2 (a) and (b).
              (c) If unusual and compelling urgency (see FAR 6.303-2) is a basis for the JOFOC, then the following applies. Explain the circumstances that led to the need for an urgent contractual action. Explain why the requirement could not have been processed in sufficient time to permit full and open competition. It should be noted that the existence of legislation, court order, or Presidential mandate is not, of itself, a sufficient basis for a JOFOC. However, the circumstances necessitating legislation, court order, or Presidential mandate may justify contractual action on an other than full and open competition basis.
              (d) If the proposed acquisition has been synopsized in accordance with the applicable requirements in FAR subpart 5.2, the Contracting Officer must incorporate the evaluation of responses to the synopsis in the JOFOC. (See 1506.371(d) for contents of the evaluation document).

              The “Debarring Official” and the “Suspending Official” as defined in FAR 9.403 is a designated individual located in the Office of Grants and Debarment. This Agency official is authorized to make the determinations and provide the notifications required under FAR subpart 9.4 or this subpart, except for the determinations required by FAR 9.405-1(a) which are to be made by the Head of the Contracting Activity. All compelling reason determinations to be made by the Debarring or Suspending Official under FAR subpart 9.4 or this subpart will be made only after coordination and consultation with the Head of the Contracting Activity. See also 2 CFR part 1532.

              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral—(1) Contracting officer responsibility. (i) When contracting personnel discover information which indicates that a cause for debarment may exist, they shall promptly report such information to the cognizant Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO). Purchasing agents in simplified acquisition activities which do not come under the direct cognizance of a CCO shall report such information by memorandum, through their immediate supervisor, and addressed to the cognizant CCO responsible for their office's contract acquisitions.
              (ii) Contracting officers shall review “The List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs” to ensure that the Agency does not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with listed contractors.
              (2) Chief of the Contracting Office responsibility. When the Chief of the Contracting Office determines that sufficient information is available to indicate that a cause for debarment may exist, such information shall be promptly reported by memorandum to the HCA. The memorandum provides the Chief of the Contracting Office's assessment of the information, any investigative report or audit, and any additional information he/she has discovered.
              (3) HCA responsibility. Upon receipt of a report of a suspected debarment situation, the HCA shall take the following actions:
              (i) Notify the Director, Suspension and Debarment Division, that investigation of a potential debarment has been initiated.
              (ii) Review the reported information.
              
              (iii) Investigate as necessary to verify or develop additional information.
              (iv) Refer the matter through the Suspension and Debarment Division to the Debarring Official for consideration of debarment; request that the Suspension and Debarment Division evaluate the information and, if appropriate, refer the matter to the Debarring Official for consideration of debarment; or recommend to the Suspension and Debarment Division that the matter be closed without further action because the facts do not warrant debarment.
              (v) Obtain legal counsel's opinion on referrals or recommendations made to the Debarring Official.
              (vi) Notify EPA Contracting Officers of those Contractors who are ineligible for solicitation, award, or subcontracting but who do not appear on the GSA Consolidated List; e.g., those who are ineligible based on a settlement reached by the Debarring Official under which the Contractor has agreed to voluntarily exclude itself from participation in Government contracting/subcontracting for a specified period or because of a Notice of Proposal to Debar.
              (4) Any official. When information is discovered which may indicate potential criminal or civil fraud activity, such information must be referred promptly to the EPA Office of Inspector General.
              (5) Debarring Official's responsibility. The Debarring Official shall:
              (i) Review referrals from the HCA together with the HCA's recommendations, if any, and determine whether further consideration by the Debarring Official is warranted and take such actions as are required by FAR subpart 9.4;
              (ii) Obtain the HCA's recommendation prior to reaching a voluntary exclusion settlement with a Contractor in lieu of debarment;
              (iii) Promptly notify the HCA of Contractors with whom a settlement in lieu of debarment has been reached under which the Contractor voluntarily excludes itself from or restricts its participation in Government contracting/subcontracting for a specified period; and of Contractors who have received a Notice of Proposal to Debar.

              1509.500
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart establishes EPA policy and procedures for identifying, evaluating, and resolving organizational conflicts of interest. EPA's policy is to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest. If EPA is unable to neutralize or mitigate the effects of a potential conflict of interest, EPA will disqualify the prospective contractor or will terminate the contract when potential or actual conflicts are identified after award.

              This subpart applies to all EPA contracts except agreements with other Federal agencies. However, this subpart applies to contracts with the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the 8(a) program.

              The Head of the Contracting Activity may waive any general rule or procedure of this subpart by determining that its application in a particular situation would not be in the Government's interest. Any request for waiver must be in accordance with FAR 9.503. The Assistant General Counsel for Contracts and Information Law shall be consulted on such waiver requests.

              1509.505-70
              Information sources.
              (a) Disclosure. Prospective EPA Contractors responding to solicitations or submitting unsolicited proposals shall provide information to the Contracting Officer for use in identifying, evaluating, or resolving potential organizational conflicts of interest. The submittal may be a certification or a disclosure, pursuant to paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.
              (1) If the prospective contractor is not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any organizational conflict of interest, it may so certify.
              (2) Prospective contractors not certifying in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section must provide a disclosure statement which describes concisely all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or planned interests relating to the work to be performed and bearing on whether they, including their chief executives, directors, or any proposed consultant or subcontractor, may have a potential organizational conflict of interest.
              (b) Failure to disclose information. Any prospective contractor failing to provide full disclosure, certification, or other required information will not be eligible for award. Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant information may also result in disqualification from award, termination of the contract for default, or debarment from Government contracts, as well as other legal action or prosecution. In response to solicitations, EPA will consider any inadvertent failure to provide disclosure certification as a “minor informality” (as explained in FAR 14.405); however, the prospective contractor must correct the omission promptly.
              (c) Exception. Where the Contractor has previously submitted a conflict of interest certification or disclosure for a contract, only an update of such statement is required when the contract is modified.

              Solicitation provisions.
              (a) Advance notice of limitations. The Contracting Officer shall alert prospective contractors by placing a notice in the solicitation whenever a particular acquisition might create an organizational conflict of interest. The notice will:
              (1) Include the information prescribed in FAR 9.507-1;
              (2) Refer prospective contractors to this subpart; and
              (3) Require proposers to disclose relevant facts concerning any past, present, or currently planned interests relating to the work described in the solicitation.
              (b) Required solicitation provision. The Contracting Officer shall include the provisions at 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72 in all solicitations, except where the following applies:
              (1) An Organizational Conflict of Interest provision is drafted for a particular acquisition (see Section 1509.507-1(a));
              (2) When the procurement is with another Federal agency (however, the provision is included in solicitations issued under the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a) program); and
              (3) When the procurement is accomplished through simplified acquisition procedures, use of the provision is optional.

              Contract clause.
              (a) The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 1552.209-71, in all Superfund contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and, as appropriate, in simplified acquisitions for Superfund work. Contracts for other than Superfund work shall include Alternate I in this clause in lieu of paragraph (e).

              (b) The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 1552.209-73, in all solicitations and contracts for Superfund work in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and, as appropriate, in simplified acquisitions for Superfund work. Contracts for other than Superfund work shall include Alternate I in this clause in lieu of paragraph (d).
              (c) The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 1552.209-74 or its alternates in the following solicitations and contracts for Superfund work in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and, as appropriate, in simplified acquisitions procedures for Superfund work. The Contracting Officer shall include the clause at 1552.209-74 in all Response Action Contract (RAC) solicitations and contracts, except Site Specific solicitations and contracts. The term “RAC” in the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses includes not only RAC solicitations and contracts but other long term response action solicitations and contracts that provide professional architect/engineer, technical, and management services to EPA to support remedial response, enforcement oversight and non-time critical removal activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act of 1986; and the Robert T. Stafford Natural Disaster Act pursuant to the Federal Response Plan and other laws to help address and/or mitigate endangerment to the public health, welfare or environment during emergencies and natural disasters, and to support States and communities in preparing for the responses to releases of hazardous substances.
              (1) Alternate I shall be used in all Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) solicitations and contracts, except site specific solicitations and contracts. The term “ERRS” in the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses includes not only ERRS solicitations and contracts but other emergency response type solicitations and contracts that provide fast responsive environmental cleanup services for hazardous substances/wastes/contaminants/material and petroleum products/oil. Environmental cleanup response to natural disasters and terrorist activities may also be required. ERRS pilot scale studies are included in the term “treatability studies.”
              (2) Alternate II shall be used in all Superfund Technical Assistance and Removal Team (START) solicitations and contracts. The term “START” in the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses include not only START solicitations and contracts but other site removal and technical support solicitations and contracts that include activities related to technical analyses in determining the nature and extent of contamination at a site and making recommendations regarding response technologies.
              (3) Alternate III shall be used in all Environmental Services Assistance Team (ESAT) solicitations and contracts.
              (4) Alternate IV shall be used in all Enforcement Support Services (ESS) solicitations and contracts. The term “ESS” in the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses not only includes ESS solicitation and contracts but other enforcement support type solicitations and contracts that involve removal actions, mandatory notices to Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), penalty assessments, public comment periods, negotiations with PRPs, and statutes of limitations for pursuing cost recovery. The enforcement support services required under the contract may be conducted to support EPA enforcement actions under any environmental statute.
              (5) Alternate V shall be used in all Superfund Headquarters Support solicitations and contracts. The Contracting Officer is authorized to modify paragraph (c) of Alternate V to reflect any unique limitations applicable to the program requirements.
              (6) Alternate VI shall be used in all Site Specific solicitations and contracts.

              (d) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.209-75 in Superfund solicitations and contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, where the solicitation or contract does not include (EPAAR) 48 CFR 1552.211-74, Work Assignments, Alternate I, or a similar clause requiring conflict of interest certifications during contract performance. This clause requires an annual conflict of interest certification from contractors when the contract does not require the submission of other conflict of interest certifications during contract performance. Contracts requiring annual certifications include: Site Specific contracts, the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP), and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts. The annual certification requires a contractor to certify that all organizational conflicts of interest have been reported, and that its personnel performing work under EPA contracts or relating to EPA contracts have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of interest to the Contractor. The annual certification shall cover the one-year period from the date of contract award for the initial certification, and a one-year period starting from the previous certification for subsequent certifications. The certification must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 45 days after the close of the certification period covered.

            Level of effort.

            The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.211-73, Level of Effort—Cost Reimbursement Contract, in cost-reimbursement contracts including cost contracts without fee, cost-sharing contracts, cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts, cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts (CPIF), and cost-plus-award-fee contracts (CPAF).

            Work assignments.
            (a) Policy. When issuing work assignments, the independent government cost estimate shall not be released to the contractor. In most cases the Contracting Officer (CO) should authorize the contractor to expend only the estimated labor hours necessary to develop the work plan and to initiate preliminary tasks which must be performed before work plan approval can be made. However, in cases where the uncertainties involved in the effort are of such a magnitude that there is no reasonable expectation that the contractor can estimate the level of effort required by the tasks, objectives, or outcomes of the requirement, the CO may provide a ceiling level of effort for the entire work assignment at the time of its issuance. In such cases, the specific uncertainties precluding reasonable estimation of the required level of effort on the contractor's part must be documented in the contract file.
            (b) Contract Clause. The CO shall insert the contract clause at 1552.211.74, Work Assignments, in cost-reimbursement contracts when work assignments are used.
            (1) For Superfund contracts, except for contracts which require annual conflict of interest certificates (e.g., Site-Specific contracts, the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP), Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts), the CO shall use the clause with either Alternate I or Alternate II. Alternate I shall be used for contractors who have at least three (3) years of records that may be searched for certification purposes. Alternate II shall be used for contractors who do not have at least three (3) years of records that may be searched.
            (2) For non-Superfund contracts, the CO shall use the clause with either Alternate III or Alternate IV. Alternate III shall be used for contractors who have at least three (3) years of records that may be searched for certification purposes. Alternate IV shall be used for contractors who do not have at least three (3) years of records that may be searched.

            1511.011-76
            Legal analysis.

              The program office submitting the procurement request must submit, as a separate attachment, a brief written statement in support of sole source acquisitions exceeding the micro-purchase threshold. The statement must cite one or more of the circumstances in FAR 6.302 and the necessary facts to support each circumstance. Although program offices may not cite the authority in FAR 6.302-7, the public interest may be used as a basis to support a sole source acquisition. If the acquisition has been synopsized as a notice of proposed sole source acquisition, the statement must include the results of the evaluation of responses to the synopsis.

              1515.404-4
              Profit.
              This section implements FAR 15.404-4 and prescribes the EPA structured approach for establishing profit or fee prenegotiation objectives.
            
            
              1515.404-470
              Policy.
              (a) The Agency's policy is to utilize profit to attract contractors who possess talents and skills necessary to the accomplishment of the objectives of the Agency, and to stimulate efficient contract performance. In negotiating profit/fee, it is necessary that all relevant factors be considered, and that fair and reasonable amounts be negotiated which give the contractor a profit objective commensurate with the nature of the work to be performed, the contractor's input to the total performance, and the risks assumed by the contractor.
              (b) The purpose of EPA's structured approach is:
              (1) To provide a standard method of evaluation;
              (2) To ensure consideration of all relevant factors;
              (3) To provide a basis for documentation and explanation of the profit or fee negotiation objective; and
              (4) To allow contractors to earn profits commensurate with the assumption of risk.
              (c) The profit-analysis factors prescribed in the EPA structured approach for analyzing profit or fee include those prescribed by FAR 15.404(d)(1), and additional factors authorized by FAR 15.404(d)(2) to foster achievement of program objectives. These profit or fee factors are prescribed in 1515.404-471.
            
            
              1515.404-471
              EPA structured approach for developing profit or fee objectives.
              (a) General. To properly reflect differences among contracts, and to select an appropriate relative profit/fee in consideration of these differences, weightings have been developed for application by the contracting officer to standard measurement bases representative of the prescribed profit factors cited in FAR 15.404(d) and EPAAR 1515.404-471(b)(1). Each profit factor or subfactor, or its components, has been assigned weights relative to their value to the contract's overall effort, and the range of weights to be applied to each profit factor.
              (b)(1) Profit/fee factors. The factors set forth in this paragraph, and the weighted ranges listed after each factor, shall be used in all instances where the profit/fee is negotiated.

              (2) The contracting officer shall first measure the “Contractor's Input to Total Performance” by the assignment of a profit percentage within the designated weight ranges to each element of contract cost. Such costs are multiplied by the specific percentages to arrive at a specific dollar profit or fee.
              (3) The amount calculated for facilities capital cost of money (FCCM) shall not be included as part of the cost base for computation of profit or fee. The profit or fee objective shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of facilities capital cost of money allowed. A complete discussion of the determination of facilities capital cost of money and its application and administration is set forth in FAR 31.205-10, and the appendix to the FAR (see 48 CFR 9904.414).

              (4) After computing a total dollar profit or fee for the Contractor's Input to Total Performance, the contracting officer shall calculate the specific profit dollars assigned for cost risk and performance. This is accomplished by multiplying the total Government cost objective, exclusive of any FCCM, by the specific weight assigned to cost risk and performance. The contracting officer shall then determine the profit or fee objective by adding the total profit dollars for the Contractor's Input to Total Performance to the specific dollar profits assigned to cost risk and performance. The contracting officer shall use EPA Form 1900-2 in hardcopy or electronic copy equivalent to facilitate the calculation of the profit or fee objective.
              (5) The weight factors discussed in this section are designed for arriving at profit or fee objectives for other than nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations. Nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations are addressed as follows:
              (i) Nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations are defined as those business entities organized and operated:
              (A) Exclusively for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes;
              (B) Where no part of the net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual;
              (C) Where no substantial part of the activities is for propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation or participating in any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office; and
              (D) Which are exempt from Federal income taxation under Section 51 of the Internal Revenue Code. (26 U.S.C.)
              (ii) For contracts with nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations where fees are involved, special factor of −3 percent shall be assigned in all cases.
              (c) Assignment of values to specific factors—(1) General. In making a judgment on the value of each factor, the contracting officer should be governed by the definition, description, and purpose of the factors, together with considerations for evaluation set forth in this paragraph.
              (2) Contractor's input to total performance. This factor is a measure of how much the contractor is expected to contribute to the overall effort necessary to meet the contract performance requirements in an efficient manner. This factor, which is separate from the contractor's responsibility for contract performance, takes into account what resources are necessary, and the creativity and ingenuity needed for the contractor to perform the statement of work successfully. This is a recognition that within a given performance output, or within a given sales dollar figure, necessary efforts on the part of individual contractors can vary widely in both value, quantity, and quality, and that the profit or fee objective should reflect the extent and nature of the contractor's contribution to total performance. Greater profit opportunity should be provided under contracts requiring a high degree of professional and managerial skill and to prospective contractors whose skills, facilities, and technical assets can be expected to lead to efficient and economical contract performance. The evaluation of this factor requires an analysis of the cost content of the proposed contract as follows:
              (i) Direct material (purchased parts and other material). (A) Analysis of these cost items shall include an evaluation of the managerial and technical effort necessary to obtain the required material. This evaluation shall include consideration of the number of orders and suppliers, and whether established sources are available or new sources must be developed. The contracting officer shall also determine whether the contractor will, for example, obtain the materials by routine orders or readily available supplies (particularly those of substantial value in relation to the total contract costs), or by detailed subcontracts for which the prime contractor will be required to develop complex specifications involving creative design.
              (B) Consideration should be given to the managerial and technical efforts necessary for the prime contractor to administer subcontracts, and to select subcontractors, including efforts to break out subcontracts from sole sources, through the introduction of competition.
              (C) Recognized costs proposed as direct material costs such as scrap charges shall be treated as material for profit evaluation.
              (D) If intracompany transfers are accepted at price, in accordance with FAR 31.205-26(e), they should be excluded from the profit or fee computation. Other intracompany transfers shall be evaluated by individual components of cost, i.e., material, labor, and overhead.
              (ii) Professional/technical and general labor. Analysis of labor should include evaluation of the comparative quality and level of the talents and experience to be employed. In evaluating labor for the purpose of assigning profit dollars, consideration should be given to the amount of notable scientific talent or unusual or scarce talent needed, in contrast to journeyman effort or supporting personnel. The diversity, or lack thereof, of scientific and engineering specialties required for contract performance, and the corresponding need for supervision and coordination, should also be evaluated.
              (iii) Overhead and general and administrative expenses. (A) Where practicable, analysis of these overhead items of cost should include the evaluation of the individual elements of these expenses, and how much they contribute to contract performance. This analysis should include a determination of the amount of labor within these overhead pools, and how this labor would be treated if it were considered as direct labor under the contract. The allocable labor elements should be given the same profit consideration as if they were direct labor. The other elements of indirect cost pools should be evaluated to determine whether they are routine expenses such as utilities, depreciation, and maintenance, and therefore given less profit consideration.
              (B) The contractor's accounting system need not break down its overhead expenses within the classification of professional/technical overhead, general overhead and general and administrative expenses.
              (iv) Subcontractors. (A) Subcontract costs should be analyzed from the standpoint of the talents and skills of the subcontractors. The analysis should consider if the prime contractor normally should be expected to have people with comparable expertise employed as full-time staff, or if the contract requires skills not normally available in an employer-employee relationship. Where the prime contractor is using subcontractors to perform labor which would normally be expected to be done in-house, the rating factor should generally be at or near 1 percent. Where exceptional expertise is retained, or the prime contractor is participating in the mentor-protégé program, the assigned weight should be nearer to the high end of the range.
              (v) Other direct costs. The analysis of these costs should be similar to the analysis of direct material.
              (3) Contractor's assumption of contract cost risk. (i) The risk of contract costs should be shifted to the fullest extent practicable to contractors, and the Government should assign a rating that reflects the degree of risk assumption. Evaluation of this risk requires a determination of the degree of cost responsibility the contractor assumes, the reliability of the cost estimates in relation to the task assumed, and the chance of the contractor's success or failure. This factor is specifically limited to the risk of contract costs. Thus, such risks of losing potential profits in other fields are not within the scope of this factor.
              (ii) The first determination of the degree of cost responsibility assumed by the contractor is related to the sharing of total risk of contract cost by the Government and the contractor, depending on selection of contract type. The extremes are a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract requiring only that the contractor use its best efforts to perform a task, and a firm-fixed-price contract for a complex item. A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract would reflect a minimum assumption of cost responsibility by the contractor, whereas a firm-fixed-price contract would reflect a complete assumption of cost responsibility by the contractor. Therefore, in the first step of determining the value given for the contractor's assumption of contract cost risk, a lower rating would be assigned to a proposed cost-plus-fixed-fee best efforts contract, and a higher rating would be assigned to a firm-fixed-price contract.
              (iii) The second determination is that of the reliability of the cost estimates. Sound price negotiation requires well-defined contract objectives and reliable cost estimates. An excessive cost estimate reduces the possibility that the cost of performance will exceed the contract price, thereby reducing the contractor's assumption of contract cost risk.

              (iv) The third determination is that of the difficulty of the contractor's task. The contractor's task may be difficult or easy, regardless of the type of contract.
              (v) Contractors are likely to assume greater cost risks only if the contracting officer objectively analyzes the risk incident to the proposed contract, and is willing to compensate contractors for it. Generally, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract would not justify a reward for risk in excess of 1 percent, nor would a firm-fixed-price contract normally justify a reward of less than 4 percent. Where proper contract type selection has been made, the reward for risk by contract type would usually fall into the following percentage ranges:
              
                
                  Type of contract
                  Percentage ranges
                
                
                  Cost-plus-fixed-fee
                  0 to 1.
                
                
                  Prospective price determination
                  4 to 5.
                
                
                  Firm-fixed-price
                  4 to 6.
                
              
              (A) These ranges may not be appropriate for all acquisitions. The contracting officer might determine that a basis exists for high confidence in the reasonableness of the estimate, and that little opportunity exists for cost reduction without extraordinary efforts. The contractor's willingness to accept ceilings on their burden rates should be considered as a risk factor for cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.
              (B) In making a contract cost risk evaluation in an acquisition that involves definitization of a letter contract, consideration should be given to the effect on total contract cost risk as a result of partial performance under a letter contract. Under some circumstances, the total amount of cost risk may have been effectively reduced by the existence of a letter contract. Under other circumstances, it may be apparent that the contractor's cost risk remained substantially as great as though a letter contract had not been used. Where a contractor has begun work under an anticipatory cost letter, the risk assumed is greater than normal. To be equitable, the determination of a profit weight for application to the total of all recognized costs, both those incurred and those yet to be expended, must be made with consideration to all relevant circumstances, not just to the portion of costs incurred or percentage of work completed prior to definitization.
            
            
              1515.404-472
              Other methods.
              (a) Contracting officers may use methods other than those prescribed in 1515.404-470 for establishing profit or fee objectives under the following types of contracts and circumstances:
              (1) Architect-engineering contracts;
              (2) Personal service contracts;
              (3) Management contracts, e.g., for maintenance or operation of Government facilities;
              (4) Termination settlements;
              (5) Services under labor-hour and time and material contracts which provide for payment on an hourly, daily, or monthly basis, and where the contractor's contribution constitutes the furnishing of personnel.
              (6) Construction contracts; and
              (7) Cost-plus-award-fee contracts.
              (b) Generally, it is expected that such methods will:
              (1) Provide the contracting officer with a technique that will ensure consideration of the relative value of the appropriate profit factors described under “Profit Factors,” in FAR 15.404-4(d) and
              (2) Serve as a basis for documentation of the profit or fee objective.
            
            
              1515.404-473
              Limitations.
              (a) In addition to the limitations established by statute (see FAR 15.404-4(b)(4)(i)), no administrative ceilings on profits or fees shall be established, except those otherwise identified in the EPAAR.
              (b) The contracting officer shall not consider any known subcontractor profit/fee as part of the basis for determining the contractor profit/fee.

              1515.408
              Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.
              (a) In addition to those provisions and clauses prescribed in FAR 15.408, when an exception to FAR 15.403-1 does not apply and no other means available can be used to ascertain whether a fair and reasonable price can be determined, the contracting officer may insert in negotiated solicitations the provisions at—
              (1) 1552.215-72 when requesting information other than cost or pricing data, for cost-reimbursable, level-of-effort-contracts. Use Alternate I for cost-reimbursable, level-of-effort contracts when the Government's requirement is for fully dedicated staff for a twelve month period(s) of performance and performance is on a Government facility; Alternate II for acquisitions for cost-reimbursable, level-of-effort contracts when the Government's requirement is for fully dedicated staff for a twelve month period(s) of performance and performance is not on a Government facility; and Alternate III if the Government's requirement is for the acquisition of supplies or equipment. The contracting officer may make revisions, deletions, or additions to 1552.215-72 and its Alternates I-III as needed to fit an individual acquisition, and
              (2) 1552.215-73, General Financial and Organizational Information.
              (b) If uncompensated overtime is proposed, the resultant contract shall include the provisions at FAR 52.237-10 and include the provision at 1552.215-74. The contracting officer may use provisions substantially the same as 1552.215-74 without requesting a deviation to the EPAAR.

              Contracting methods.
              The Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies Appropriation Act contains a requirement that none of the funds provided in the Act may be used for payment through grants or contracts to recipients that do not share in the cost of conducting research resulting from proposals that are not specifically solicited by the Government. Accordingly, contracts for research which result from unsolicited proposals shall provide for the contractor to bear a portion of the cost of performance for work subject to the Act. The extent of the cost sharing shall reflect the mutuality of interest of the contractor and the Government. Therefore, where there is no measurable gain to the performing organization, cost sharing is not required.

              Payment of fee.

              The policy of EPA for cost-reimbursement, term form contracts is to make provisional payment of fee (i.e. the fixed fee on cost-plus-fixed-fee type contracts or the base fee on cost-plus-award-fee type contracts) on a percentage of work completed basis, when such a method will not prove detrimental to proper contract performance. Percentage of work completed is the ratio of the direct labor hours performed in relation to the direct labor hours set forth in the contract in clause 48 CFR 1552.211-73, Level of Effort—Cost Reimbursement Contract. Provisional payment of fee will remain subject to withholding provisions, such as in FAR 52.216-8, Fixed Fee.

              1516.303-71
              Definition.
              Cost-sharing is a generic term denoting any situation where the Government does not fully reimburse a contractor for all allowable costs necessary to accomplish the project under the contract. This term encompasses cost-matching and cost-limitations, in addition to cost-sharing. Cost-sharing does not include usual contractual limitations such as indirect cost ceilings in accordance with FAR 42.707, or ceilings on travel or other direct costs. Cost-sharing contracts may be required as a result of Congressional mandate.

              1516.303-72
              Policy.
              (a) The Agency shall use cost-sharing contracts where the principal purpose is ultimate commercialization and utilization of technologies by the private sector. There should also be a reasonable expectation of future economic benefits for the contractor and the Government beyond the Government's contract.
              (b) Cost-sharing may be accomplished by a contribution to either direct or indirect costs, provided such costs are reasonable, allocable and allowable in accordance with the cost principles of the contract. Allowable costs which are absorbed by the contractor as its share of contract costs may not be charged directly or indirectly to the Agency or the Federal Government.
              (c) Unsolicited proposals will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Contracting Officer as to the appropriateness of cost-sharing.

              1516.303-73
              Types of cost-sharing.
              (a) Cost-sharing may be accomplished in various forms or combinations. These include, but are not limited to: cash outlays, real property or interest therein, personal property or services, cost matching, or other in-kind contributions.
              (b) In-kind contributions represent non-cash contributions provided by the performing contractor which would normally be a charge against the contract. While in-kind contributions are an acceptable method of cost-sharing, should the booked costs of property appear unrealistic, the fair market value of the property shall be determined pursuant to 1516.303-74 of this chapter.
              (c) In-kind contributions may be in the form of personal property (equipment or supplies) or services which are directly beneficial, specifically identifiable and necessary for the performance of the contract. In-kind contributions must meet all of the following criteria before acceptance.
              (1) Be verifiable from the contractor's books and records;

              (2) Not be included as contributions under any other Federal contract;
              
              (3) Be necessary to accomplish project objectives;
              (4) Provide for types of charges that would otherwise be allowable under applicable Federal cost principles appropriate to the contractor's organization; and
              (5) Not be paid for by the Federal Government under any contract, agreement or grant.

              1516.303-74
              Determining the value of in-kind contributions.
              In-kind contributions accepted from a contractor will be addressed on a case-by-case basis provided the established values do not exceed fair market values.
              (a) Where the Agency receives title to donated land, building, equipment or supplies and the property is not fully consumed during performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer should establish the property's value based on the contractor's booked costs (i.e., acquisition cost less depreciation, if any) at the time of donation. If the booked costs reflect unrealistic values when compared to current market conditions, the Contracting Officer may establish another appropriate value if supported by an independent appraisal of the fair market value of the donated property or property in similar condition and circumstances.
              (b) The Contracting Officer will monitor reports of in-kind costs as they are incurred or recognized during the contract period of performance to determine that the value of in-kind services does not exceed fair market values.
              (c) The value of any services or the use of personal or real property donated by a contractor should be established when necessary in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies and Federal cost principles.

              1516.303-75
              Amount of cost-sharing.
              (a) Contractors should contribute a reasonable amount of the total project cost covered under the contract. The ratio of cost participation should correlate to the apparent advantages available to performers and the proximity of implementing commercialization, i.e., the higher the potential for future profits, the higher the contractor's share should be.
              (b) Fee will not be paid to the contractor or any member of the contractor team (subcontractors and consultants) which has a substantial and direct interest in the contract, or is in a position to gain long term benefits from the contract. A vulnerability the Contracting Officer should consider in reviewing a prime contractor's request for consent to subcontract is whether subcontractors under prime cost-sharing contracts have a significant direct interest in the contract to gain long-term benefits from the contract.
              (c) The Contracting Officer, with the input of technical experts, may consider the following factors in determining reasonable levels of cost sharing:
              (1) The availability of the technology to competitors;
              (2) Improvements in the contractor's market share position;
              (3) The time and risk necessary to achieve success;
              (4) If the results of the project involve patent rights which could be sold or licensed;
              (5) If the contractor has non-Federal sources of funds to include as cost participation; and
              (6) If the contractor has the production and other capabilities to capitalize the results of the project.
              (d) A contractor's cost participation can be provided by other subcontractors with which it has contractual arrangements to perform the contract as long as the contractor's cost-sharing goal is met.

              Fee on cost-sharing contracts by subcontractors.
              (a) Subcontractors under prime cost-sharing contracts who do not have a significant direct interest in the contract or who are not in a position to gain long-term benefits from the contract may earn a fee.

              (b) Contracting Officers should be alert to a potential vulnerability for the Government under cost-sharing contracts when evaluating proposed subcontractors or consenting to a subcontract during contract administration, where the subcontractor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the prime. The vulnerability consists of the subsidiary earning a large amount of fee, which could be returned to the prime through stock dividends or other intercompany transactions. This could circumvent the objective of a cost-sharing contract.

              (b) The manner of cost-sharing and how it is to be accomplished shall be set forth in the contract. Additionally, contracts which provide for cost-sharing shall require the contractor to maintain records adequate to reflect the nature and extent of their cost-sharing as well as those costs charged the Agency. Such records may be subject to an Agency audit.

              (b) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.216-74, Payment of Fee, in solicitations and contracts where a cost-reimbursement term form contract is contemplated, unless the Contracting Officer determines that such a provision would be detrimental to ensuring proper contract performance.
              (c) The Contracting Officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as 48 CFR 1552.216-76, Estimated Cost and Cost-Sharing, in solicitations and contracts where the total incurred costs are shared by the contractor on a straight percentage basis. The Contracting Officer may develop other clauses, as appropriate, following the same approach, but reflecting different cost-sharing arrangements negotiated on specific contract actions.

              Award term incentives.
              (a) Award term incentives enable a contractor to become eligible for additional periods of performance under a current contract by achieving prescribed performance measures under that contract.
              (b) Award term incentives are designed to motivate contractors to superior performance. Accordingly, the prescribed performance measures, i.e., acceptable quality levels (AQL) which must be achieved by a contractor to become eligible for an award term typically will be in excess of the AQLs necessary for Government acceptance of contract deliverables.
              (c) The Award Term Incentive Plan sets forth the evaluation process, including the evaluation criteria and performance measures, and serves as the basis for award term decisions. The Award Term Incentive Plan may be unilaterally revised by the Government.

              (d) Award term incentives may be used in conjunction with options. The Federal Acquisition Regulation does not prescribe a level of performance for the exercise of options, as contrasted with award term incentives, which should require superior performance as discussed in paragraph (b) of this subsection. Award term incentive periods will follow any option periods.
              (e)(1) The Government has the unilateral right not to grant or to cancel award term incentive periods and the associated award term incentive plans if—
              (i) The Contracting Officer has failed to initiate an award term incentive period, regardless of whether the contractor's performance permitted the Contracting Officer to consider initiating the award term incentive period; or
              (ii) The contractor has failed to achieve the performance measures for the corresponding evaluation period; or
              (iii) The Government notifies the contractor in writing it does not have funds available for the award term; or
              (iv) The Government no longer has a need for the award term incentive period at or before the time an award term incentive period is to commence.
              (2) When an award term incentive period is not granted or cancelled, any—
              (i) Prior award term incentive periods for which the contractor remains otherwise eligible are unaffected.
              (ii) Subsequent award term incentive periods are thereby also cancelled.
              (f) Award term incentives may be appropriate for any type of service contract.

              1516.401-270
              Definition.
              Acceptable quality level (AQL) as used in this subpart means the minimum percent of deliverables which are compliant with a given performance standard that would permit a contractor to become eligible for an award term incentive. Because the performance necessary for eligibility for the award term incentive may be in excess of that necessary for the Government acceptance of contract deliverables, the AQLs associated with the award term incentive may exceed the AQLs associated with the acceptance of contract deliverables. For example, under contract X, acceptable performance is 75 percent of reports submitted to the Government within five days. However, to be eligible for an award term incentive, 85 percent of reports must be submitted to the Government within five days.

              (b) The base fee shall not exceed three percent of the estimated cost of the contract, exclusive of the fee.
              (c) Unearned award fee may not be carried forward from one performance period into a subsequent performance period unless approved by the FDO.

              What is a Notice to Proceed?
              (a) A Notice to Proceed (NTP) is a type of letter contract issued pursuant to FAR 16.603 under which an EPA Federal Classification Series 1102 (FCS) contracting officer or a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with delegated procurement authority may initiate, in certain defined situations and subject to certain limitations and conditions, contracting actions to respond to certain situations as described in CERCLA section 104(a)(1) (42 U.S.C. 9604(a)(1)) and the Clean Water Act sections 311(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B) (33 U.S.C. 1321(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B)). An NTP may be utilized as a contractual instrument for certain—
              (1) Actions that EPA is authorized to undertake under CERCLA section 104(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 9604(a)(1), and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), to respond to situations where any hazardous substance has been released or there is a substantial threat of such a release into the environment, or there is a release or substantial threat of release into the environment of any pollutant or contaminant which may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare, and

              (2) Actions that EPA is authorized to undertake under sections 311(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B), and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), to respond when there is a discharge, or a substantial threat of a discharge (to or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, the contiguous zone, or natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management of the United States), of oil or a hazardous substance from a vessel, onshore facility, or offshore facility that is a substantial threat to the public health or welfare. Pursuant to a class Justification For Other Than Full and Open Competition executed under the authority of FAR 6.302-2 and 6.303-1(c), an NTP may be issued on a non-competitive basis.
              (b) What do subsections 1516.603-1 and 1516.603-2 cover? EPAAR 1516.603-1 and 1516.603-2 contain information and procedures relating to issuance and definitization of an NTP. An NTP is subject to, and must comply with, the applicable requirements for letter contracts in FAR 16.603 and the requirements in this section, and be definitized by an EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer.

              1516.603-2
              What are the requirements for use of an NTP?
              (a) An EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority may issue an NTP so long as it does not exceed the limits of his or her procurement authority and only when all of the following conditions have been met:
              (1) A written determination has been made by the Federal on-scene coordinator that—
              (i) As authorized by and consistent with CERCLA section 104(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 9604(a)(1), and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), the EPA must take action to respond to a hazardous substance release or substantial threat of such a release into the environment, or a release or substantial threat of a release into the environment of any pollutant or contaminant which may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare, or
              (ii) As authorized by and consistent with the Clean Water Act sections 311(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B), 33 U.S.C. 1321(c)(2) and (e)(1)(B), and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), the EPA must take action to respond to a discharge, or a substantial threat of a discharge (to or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, the contiguous zone, or natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management of the United States), of oil or a hazardous substance from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility that is of such a size and character as to pose a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States; and
              (2) Before a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority may issue an NTP, he or she must confirm that an EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer is not available to provide the required contracting support by the time the Federal on-scene coordinator requires the response action to be undertaken; and
              (3) A written determination is made by an EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority that there is no other existing contracting mechanism available to provide the required contracting support by the time required, including the inability of an existing emergency response contractor or other existing contract vehicle to respond in the required time frame. These conditions, as well as any other requirements applicable to NTPs or letter contracts contained in the FAR or EPAAR , must be met before an NTP can be issued by an EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority.

              (b) What should be included in an NTP? (1) Since an NTP is a type of letter contract, it is subject to the requirements of FAR 16.603. All of the relevant requirements of FAR 16.603 apply to NTP's including FAR 16.603-2, 16.603-3, and 16.603-4, and an NTP will include all appropriate FAR and EPAAR contract clauses. An NTP should also include an overall price ceiling and be as complete and definite as possible under the circumstances. To the extent NTPs require modification of any FAR or EPAAR prescribed procedures or clauses, an appropriate FAR or EPAAR deviation will be prepared.
              
              (2) The EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority shall include in each NTP the clauses required by the FAR or EPAAR for the type of definitive contract contemplated and any additional clauses known to be appropriate for it. In addition, the following clauses must be inserted in the solicitation (if one is issued) and the NTP when an NTP is used:
              (i) The clause at FAR 52.216-23, Execution and Commencement of Work, except that the term on-scene coordinator may be used in place of the term contracting officer;
              (ii) The clause at FAR 52.216-24, Limitation of Government Liability, with dollar amounts completed in a manner consistent with FAR 16.603-2(d); and
              (iii) The clause at FAR 52.216-25, Contract Definitization, with its paragraph (b) completed in a manner consistent with FAR 16.603-2(c) or any applicable FAR deviation. The clause at FAR 52.216-26, Payment of Allowable Costs Before Definitization, shall also be included in a solicitation (if one is issued) and NTPs if a cost-reimbursement definitive contract is contemplated.
              (3) Each NTP shall, as required by the clause at FAR 52.216-25, Contract Definitization, contain a negotiated definitization schedule that includes:
              (i) Dates for submission of the contractor's price proposal, required cost and pricing data, and if required, make-or-buy and subcontracting plans;
              (ii) The date for the start of negotiations; and
              (iii) A target date for definitization which shall be the earliest practicable date for definitization (an NTP must be definitized by an EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer). The schedule will provide for definitization of the NTP within 90 calendar days after the date of the NTP award. However, the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer may, in extreme cases and according to agency procedures, authorize an additional period. If, after exhausting all reasonable efforts, the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer and the contractor cannot negotiate a definitive contract because of failure to reach agreement as to price or fee, the clause at 52.216-25 requires the contractor to proceed with the work and provides that the contracting officer may, with the approval of the head of the contracting activity, determine a reasonable price or fee in accordance with subpart 15.4 and part 31 of the FAR, subject to appeal as provided in the Disputes clause.
              (4) The maximum liability of the Government inserted in the clause at 52.216-24, Limitation of Government Liability, shall, as approved by the official who authorized the NTP, be the estimated amount necessary to cover the contractor's requirements for funds to complete the work to be performed under the NTP. However, it shall not exceed the estimated cost of the definitive contract.
              (c) Are there any financial or monetary limitations on the use of an NTP? In addition to the requirements for issuance of an NTP set forth elsewhere in this subpart—
              (1) The total definitized dollar value of an individual NTP shall not exceed $200,000.00, and
              (2) The applicable Program Office must commit and make available appropriate funding for the emergency response action taken under the NTP prior to NTP issuance.

              (d) Are there any other procedural requirements for issuance of an NTP? An NTP must be issued in writing by the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or the duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority using a Standard Form 33. In addition, the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or the EPA on-scene coordinator awarding the NTP must ensure that the NTP complies with all applicable requirements for letter contracts set forth in the FAR and the requirements of this section, includes all relevant provisions and clauses, and that all actual or potential conflict of interest or other contracting issues are identified and resolved prior to NTP issuance. To assist the EPA on-scene coordinator and EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer in their responsibilities regarding NTP award, an NTP checklist will be completed by the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer or EPA on-scene coordinator prior to issuance of the NTP.
              
              (e) What happens after an NTP is awarded to a contractor? (1) If an NTP is issued by a duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinator with a delegation of procurement authority, he or she must notify the cognizant EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer of the NTP award, and provide the NTP checklist to the contracting officer, as soon as possible but in no event later than the next working day after NTP issuance.
              (2) Within 5 working days of the EPA on-scene coordinator's award of an NTP, the on-scene coordinator shall provide to the cognizant EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer all NTP documents, materials, and information necessary for the contracting officer to definitize the contract, and should retain a copy for his/her records. An EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer will be responsible for definitization of the NTP consistent with the definitization procedures set forth in this subpart. During the process of definitizing the NTP, the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer will send the contractor the “Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors” for completion. The contractor will complete this information, and any other required information, and submit it to the EPA FCS 1102 contracting officer prior to definitization of the NTP.
              (f) The CCO, who is authorized by EPAAR 1516.603-3 to make the determination to use a letter contract, shall make a class determination and findings authorizing EPA FCS 1102 contracting officers and duly authorized EPA on-scene coordinators with delegations of procurement authority to award NTPs pursuant to the conditions set forth in this subpart.

              1517.207
              Exercise of options.
              (a) Unless otherwise approved by the Chief of the Contracting Office, contracts for services employing option periods shall require that a preliminary written notice of the Government's intention to exercise the option be furnished to the Contractor a minimum of sixty (60) calendar days prior to the date for the exercise of the option. Failure to provide such preliminary notice within the timeframe established in the contract waives the Government's right to unilaterally exercise the option and requires the negotiation of a bilateral contract modification in order to extend the period of performance, where such an extension is authorized.

              (b) When the term of the service contract coincides with the fiscal year and delays in receipt of authority to obligate funds for the new fiscal year are anticipated, the Contracting Officer, if the contract so provides (see FAR 17.204(d)), may, within 60 days after the end of the fiscal year, unilaterally exercise an option to extend the term of the contract. The option may be exercised only if funds become available within the 60-day period. In the event that sufficient funding is not available within the 60 day period, the Government waives the right to exercise the option, thereby rendering any additional requirements subject to full and open competition requirements.
              
              (c) The Contracting Officer, if the contract so provides, may, subject to the conditions in FAR 17.204(d), 32.703-2, and 32.705-1(a), exercise an option contingent upon the availability of funds. To exercise such an option, the contract must contain the clause in FAR 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. Under no circumstances shall any action be taken which could be construed as creating a legal liability on the part of the Government until a formal notice of availability of funds in the form of a contract modification has been issued by the Contracting Officer.

              Policy.
              Each program's Assistant or Associate Administrator shall be responsible for developing its socioeconomic goals on a fiscal year basis. The goals shall be developed in collaboration with the supporting Chiefs of Contracting Offices (CCOs) or Regional Acquisition Managers (RAMs), the assigned Small Business Specialist (SBS), and the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU). The goals will be based on advance procurement plans and past performance.

              The Director of the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) provides guidance and advice, as appropriate, to Agency program and contracts officials on small business programs. The OSDBU Director is the central point of contact for inquiries concerning the small business programs from industry, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Congress; and shall advise the Administrator and staff of such inquiries as required. The OSDBU Director shall represent the Agency in the negotiations with the other Government agencies on small business programs matters.

              Small business specialists.
              (a) Small Business Specialists (SBSs) shall be appointed in writing. Regional SBSs will normally be appointed from members of staffs of the appointing authority. The appointing authorities for regional SBSs are the RAMs. The SBSs for EPA headquarters, Research Triangle Park (RTP), and Cincinnati shall be appointed by the OSDBU Director. The SBS is administratively responsible directly to the appointing authority and, on matters relating to small business programs activities, receives technical guidance from the OSDBU Director.

              (b) A copy of each appointment and termination of all SBSs shall be forwarded to the OSDBU Director. In addition to performing the duties outlined in paragraph (c) of this section that are normally performed in the activity to which assigned, the SBS shall perform such additional functions as may be prescribed from time to time in furtherance of overall small business programs goals. The SBS may be appointed on either a full- or part-time basis; however, when appointed on a part-time basis, small business duties shall take precedence over collateral responsibilities.
              
              (c) The SBS appointed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall perform the following duties as appropriate:
              (1) Maintain a program designed to locate capable small business sources for current and future acquisitions;
              (2) Coordinate inquiries and requests for advice from small business concerns on acquisition matters;
              (3) Review all proposed solicitations in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, assure that small business concerns will be afforded an equitable opportunity to compete, and, as appropriate, initiate recommendations for small business set-asides, or offers of requirements to the Small Business Administration (SBA) for the 8(a) program, and complete EPA Form 1900-37, “Record of Procurement Request Review,” as appropriate;
              (4) Take action to assure the availability of adequate specifications and drawings, when necessary, to obtain small business participation in an acquisition. When small business concerns cannot be given an opportunity on a current acquisition, initiate action, in writing, with appropriate technical and contracting personnel to ensure that necessary specifications and/or drawings for future acquisitions are available;
              (5) Review proposed contracts for possible breakout of items or services suitable for acquisition from small business concerns;
              (6) Participate in the evaluation of a prime contractor's small business subcontracting programs;
              (7) Assure that adequate records are maintained, and accurate reports prepared, concerning small business participation in acquisition programs;
              (8) Make available to SBA copies of solicitations when so requested; and
              (9) Act as liaison with the appropriate SBA office or representative in connection with matters concerning the small business programs including set-asides.

              Review of acquisitions.
              (a) If no Small Business Administration (SBA) representative is available, the Small Business Specialist (SBS) shall initiate recommendations to the contracting officer for small business set-asides with respect to individual acquisitions or classes of acquisitions or portions thereof.
              (b) When the SBS has recommended that all, or a portion, of an individual acquisition or class of acquisitions be set aside for small business, the contracting officer shall:
              (1) Promptly concur in the recommendation; or
              (2) Promptly disapprove the recommendation, stating in writing the reasons for disapproval. If the contracting officer disapproves the recommendation of the SBS, the SBS may appeal to the appropriate appointing authority, whose decision shall be final.

Such set-asides shall be considered to be unilateral small business set-asides, and shall be withdrawn in accordance with the procedure of FAR 19.506 only if found not to serve the best interest of the Government.
              (b) Small business set-aside preferences for construction acquisitions in excess of $1,000,000 shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.

              Acquisition of environmentally preferable meeting and conference facilities and services.
              (a) Scope. This section establishes the policy and the procedures for acquiring environmentally preferable meeting and conference facilities and services. For purposes of this section, the term “contracting officer” refers to any EPA employee with purchasing authority. For purposes of this section, the terms “meeting and conference facilities” or “conference facilities” refer to any off-site commercial facility which is purchased for the use of an EPA conference or event, whether the purpose of the event is a meeting, conference, training session, or other official purpose.
              (b) Conference facilities. EPA conducts government events at facilities owned and operated by private, third-party vendors. These facilities—
              (1) May provide conference participants with lodging, food and beverage, and other on-site event support services.
              (2) Demonstrate they are environmentally preferable by their responses to the 17 questions in 1552.223-71(c) highlighting environmental performance. These questions address, among other things, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the production and disposal of solid waste, the use of and exposure to toxic chemicals/materials, and the depletion of natural resources including water.
              (c) Policy. Contracting officers shall purchase environmentally preferable meeting and conference facilities and services to the greatest extent practicable. Environmentally preferable is defined at FAR 2.101 and shall be considered in all purchases of meeting and conference facilities and services.
              (d) Procedures for micropurchases. The contracting officer shall request that potential third party conference facility vendors respond to the 17 questions in 1552.223-71(c) or language substantially the same as these questions, in order to evaluate their environmental performance.
              (e) Procedures for purchases of conference facilities exceeding the micropurchase threshold. The contracting officer shall request that potential third party conference facility vendors respond to the 17 questions in 1552.223-71(c) or language substantially the same as these questions, in order to evaluate their environmental performance. The contracting officer shall notify vendors that the basis for award will be best value with price and other factors considered. Environmental preferability, as determined by evaluating the information submitted in response to the questions and specifications at 1552.223-71(c) or information submitted in response to substantially similar questions and specifications, shall be considered among the other factors. The contracting officer shall determine the relative importance of price and other factors as appropriate to the acquisition, but in all cases shall consider environmental preferability as a significant factor.
              (f) Contractor support for meetings and conferences. A contract, order, work assignment or purchasing agreement that includes contractor support for meeting and conference planning and logistics must include requirements to make use of environmentally preferable meeting and conference facilities and services. The contracting officer shall ensure language is included in the tasking document work statement that requires the contractor to use the provisions at 1552.223-71 or language approved by the contracting officer that is substantially the same as the provisions, when soliciting quotes or offers for meeting and conference services on behalf of the EPA.
              (g) Solicitation provision. The contracting officer shall insert provisions or language substantially the same as the provisions at 1552.223-71 EPA Green Meetings and Conferences, in solicitations for meeting and conference services. Contracting officers issuing an oral solicitation must also use these provisions, though they may be provided to the vendor orally or electronically. Contractors soliciting quotes or offers for meeting and conference services on behalf of EPA shall use the provisions, or language approved by the contracting officer that is substantially the same as the provisions.

              (b) The Contracting Officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 1552.237-71, Technical Direction, in solicitations and contracts where the Contracting Officer intends to delegate authority to issue technical direction to the Contracting Officer's Representative(s).

              (c) The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 1552.237-72, Key Personnel, in solicitations and contracts when it is necessary for contract performance to identify Contractor key personnel. Contracting Officers have the flexibility to identify the required number of days of key personnel commitment during the early stages of contractor performance. The length of time will be based on the requirements of individual acquisitions when continued assignment is essential to the successful implementation of the program's mission. Therefore, Contracting Officers may use a clause substantially the same as in 48 CFR 1552.237-72, regarding substitution of key personnel. Contracting Officers may include a different number of days in excess of the ninety (90) days included in this clause, if approved at one level above the Contracting Officer.

                “Composition” applies to the setting of type by hot-metal casting, photo typesetting, or electronic character generating devices for the purpose of producing camera copy, negatives, a plate or image to be used in the production of printing or microform.
                “Camera copy” (or “camera-ready copy”) is a final document suitable for printing/duplication.
                “Desktop Publishing” is a method of composition using computers with the final output or generation of a camera copy done by a color inkjet or color laser printer. This is not considered “printing.” However, if the output from desktop publishing is being sent to a typesetting device (i.e., Linotronic) with camera copy being produced in either paper or negative format, these services are considered “printing.”
                “Microform” is any product produced in a miniaturized image format, for mass or general distribution and as a substitute for conventionally printed material. Microform services are classified as printing services and include microfiche and microfilm. The contractor may make up to two sets of microform files for archival purposes at the end of the contract period of performance.
                “Duplication” means the making of copies on photocopy machines employing electrostatic, thermal, or other processes without using an intermediary such as a negative or plate.
                “Requirement” means an individual photocopying task. (There may be multiple requirements under a Work Assignment or Delivery Order. Each requirement would be subject to the duplication limitation of 5,000 copies of one page or 25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate per requirement).
                “Incidental” means a draft and/or proofed document (not a final document) that is not prohibited from printing under EPA contracts.
                (b) Prohibition. (1) The contractor shall not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing in connection with the performance of work under this contract. Duplication of more than 5,000 copies of one page or more than 25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate per requirement constitutes printing. The intent of the printing limitation is to eliminate duplication of final documents.
                (2) In compliance with EPA Order 2200.4a, EPA Publication Review Procedure, the Office of Communications, Education, and Media Relations is responsible for the review of materials generated under a contract published or issued by the Agency under a contract intended for release to the public.
                (c) Affirmative Requirements. (1) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the contractor shall use double-sided copying to produce any progress report, draft report or final report.

                (2) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the contractor shall use recycled paper for reports delivered to the Agency which meet the minimum content standards for paper and paper products as set forth in EPA's Web site for the Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines at: http://www.epa.gov/cpg/.
                
                (d) Permitted Contractor Activities. (1) The prohibitions contained in paragraph (b) do not preclude writing, editing, or preparing manuscript copy, or preparing related illustrative material to a final document (camera-ready copy) using desktop publishing.
                (2) The contractor may perform a requirement involving the duplication of less than 5,000 copies of only one page, or less than 25,000 copies of multiple pages in the aggregate, using one color (black), such pages shall not exceed the maximum image size of 103/4 by 141/4 inches, or 11 by 17 paper stock. Duplication services below these thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of the contract will require duplication in excess of these thresholds, contractors must immediately notify the contracting officer in writing and a waiver must be obtained. Only the Joint Committee on Printing has the authority to grant waivers to the printing requirements. All Agency waiver requests must be coordinated with EPA's Headquarters Printing Management Team, Facilities and Services Division, and with the Office of General Counsel. Duplication services of “incidentals” in excess of the thresholds are allowable.
                (3) The contractor may perform a requirement involving the multi-color duplication of no more than 100 pages in the aggregate using color copier technology, such pages shall not exceed the maximum image size of 103/4 by 141/4 inches, or 11 by 17 paper stock. Duplication services below these thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of the contract will require duplication in excess of these limits, contractors must immediately notify the contracting officer in writing and a waiver must be obtained. Only the Joint Committee on Printing has the authority to grant waivers to the printing requirements. All Agency waiver requests must be coordinated with EPA's Headquarters Printing Management Team, Facilities and Services Division, and with the Office of General Counsel.

                (4) The contractor may perform the duplication of no more than a total of 500 units of an electronic information storage device (e.g., CD-ROMs, DVDs, thumb drives 1
                  ) (including labeling and packaging) per work assignment or task order/delivery order per contract year. Duplication services below these thresholds are not considered printing. If performance of the contract will require duplication in excess of these thresholds, contractors must immediately notify the contracting officer in writing and a waiver must be obtained. Only the Joint Committee on Printing has the authority to grant waivers to the printing requirements. All Agency waiver requests must be coordinated with EPA's Headquarters Printing Management Team, Facilities and Services Division, and with the Office of General Counsel.
                
                  
                    1 Pursuant to the July 2008 guidance Promotional Communications for EPA, a thumb drive can be used as a promotional item, but it also must be an information medium in itself. Namely, it must have substantive EPA information already loaded into the drive. Due to its intrinsic material value, it may not be used simply or primarily to display an EPA message on the exterior of the drive.
                
                (e) Violations. The contractor may not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing in connection with the performance of work under the contract. The cost of any printing services in violation of this clause will be disallowed, or not accepted by the Government.
                (f) Flowdown Clause. The contractor shall include in each subcontract which may involve a requirement for any printing/duplicating/copying a provision substantially the same as this clause.

                (a) The prospective Contractor certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that it is not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any potential organizational conflict of interest. If the prospective Contractor cannot so certify, it shall provide a disclosure statement in its proposal which describes all relevant information concerning any past, present, or planned interests bearing on whether it (including its chief executives and directors, or any proposed consultant or subcontractor) may have a potential organizational conflict of interest.
                (b) Prospective Contractors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 and EPAAR part 1509 for policies and procedures for avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest.

              Organizational conflicts of interest.
              As prescribed in 1509.507-2, insert the following contract clause in all contracts except:
              (a) When specific clauses are required per EPAAR part 1509;
              (b) When the procurement is with another Federal agency (however, the provision is included in contracts with SBA and its subcontractor under the 8(a) program); and
              (c) When the procurement is accomplished through simplified acquisition procedures, use of the clause is optional.
              
                Organizational Conflicts of Interest (MAY 1994)
                (a) The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.
                (b) Prior to commencement of any work, the Contractor agrees to notify the Contracting Officer immediately that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, no actual or potential conflict of interest exists or to identify to the Contracting Officer any actual or potential conflict of interest the firm may have. In emergency situations, however, work may begin but notification shall be made within five (5) working days.

                (c) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is identified during performance, the Contractor will immediately make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest. The Contractor shall continue performance until notified by the Contracting Officer of any contrary action to be taken.
                (d) Remedies—The EPA may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose it or misprepresented relevant information to the Contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

                (c) The following applies when work is performed under this contract: Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor, during the life of the work assignment, task order, or tasking document and for a period of five (5) years after the completion of the work assignment, task order, or tasking document, agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.
                (d) The Contractor and any subcontractors, during the life of this contract, shall be ineligible to enter into an EPA contract or a subcontract under an EPA contract, which supports EPA's performance of Superfund Headquarters policy work including support for the analysis and development of regulations, policies, or guidance that govern, affect, or relate to the conduct of response action activities, unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. Examples of such contracts include, but are not limited to, Superfund Management and Analytical support contracts, and Superfund Technical and Analytical support contracts.
                (e) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are submitted for any work that would require written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the restrictions of this clause, then the bids/proposals are submitted at the Contractor's own risk.

The Contractor may request in writing that the Contracting Officer exempt from this clause a particular subcontract or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services not specifically listed above, including laboratory analysis. The Contracting Officer will review and evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis before approving or disapproving the request.
                (h) If the Contractor seeks an expedited decision regarding its initial future contracting request, the Contractor may submit its request to both the Contracting Officer and the next administrative level within the Contracting Officer's organization.
                (i) A review process available to the Contractor when an adverse determination is received shall consist of a request for reconsideration to the Contracting Officer or a request for review submitted to the next administrative level within the Contracting Officer's organization. An adverse determination resulting from a request for reconsideration by the Contracting Officer will not preclude the contractor from requesting a review by the next administrative level. Either a request for review or a request for reconsideration must be submitted to the appropriate level within 30 calendar days after receipt of the initial adverse determination.

              Level of effort—cost-reimbursement contract.
              As prescribed in 1511.011-73, the contracting officer shall insert the following contract clause in cost-reimbursement contracts including cost contracts without fee, cost-sharing contracts, cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts, cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts (CPIF), and cost-plus-award-fee contracts (CPAF).
              
                Level of Effort—Cost-Reimbursement Contract (MAY 2016)
                (a) The Contractor shall perform all work and provide all required reports within the level of effort specified below. The Contractor shall provide up to ____ direct labor hours for the base period. The Government's best estimate of the level of effort to fulfill these requirements is provided for advisory and estimating purposes. The Government is only obligated to pay for direct labor hours ordered and corresponding fixed fee for labor hours completed.
                (b) Direct labor includes personnel such as engineers, scientists, draftsmen, technicians, statisticians, and programmers, and not support personnel such as company management or data entry/word processing/accounting personnel even though such support personnel are normally treated as direct labor by the Contractor. The level of effort specified in paragraph (a) of this section includes Contractor, subcontractor, and consultant non-support labor hours.
                (c) If the Contractor provides less than 90 percent of the level of effort specified for the base period or any optional period exercised, an equitable downward adjustment of the fixed fee, if any, for that period will be made. The downward adjustment will reduce the fixed fee by the percentage by which the total expended level of effort is less than 100% of that specified in paragraph (a). (For instance, if a hypothetical base-period LOE of 100,000 hours is being reduced to 70,000, the fixed fee shall also be reduced by the same 30%. Using a corresponding hypothetical base-period fixed fee pool of $300,000, the reduced fixed-fee amount is calculated as: $300,000 × (70,000 hours/100,000 hours) = $210,000.)
                (d) The Government may require the Contractor to provide additional effort up to 110 percent of the level of effort for any period until the estimated cost for that period has been reached. However, this additional effort shall not result in any increase in the fixed fee, if any.
                (e) If this is a cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF) contract, the term “fee” in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section means “base fee and incentive fee.” If this is a cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF) contract, the term “fee” in paragraphs (c) and (d) means “base fee and award fee.”
                (f) If the level of effort specified to be ordered during a given base or option period is not ordered during that period, that level of effort may not be accumulated and ordered during a subsequent period.
                (g) These terms and conditions do not supersede the requirements of either the “Limitation of Cost” or “Limitation of Funds” clauses.

              As prescribed in 1511.011-74, insert the following contract clause in cost-reimbursement contracts when work assignments are to be used.
              
                Work Assignments (DEC 2014)
                (a) The contractor shall perform work under this contract as specified in written work assignments issued by the Contracting Officer.
                (b) Each work assignment may include (1) a numerical designation, (2) approved workplan labor hours or an estimated initial level of effort provided in accordance with 1511.011-74, (3) the period of performance and schedule of deliverables, and (4) the description of the work.
                (c) The Contractor shall acknowledge receipt of each work assignment by returning to the Contracting Officer a signed copy of the work assignment within _ calendar days after its receipt. The Contractor shall begin working on a work plan immediately upon receipt of a work assignment. Within _ calendar days after receipt of a work assignment, the Contractor shall submit _ copies of a work plan to the Contract-level Contracting Officer's Representative and _ copies to the Contracting Officer. The work plan shall include a detailed technical and staffing plan and a detailed cost estimate. Within _ calendar days after receipt of the work plan, the Contracting Officer will provide written approval or disapproval of it to the Contractor. The Contractor is not authorized to start work without an approved work plan unless approved by the Contracting Officer or otherwise specified. Also, if the Contracting Officer disapproves a work plan, the Contractor shall stop work until the problem causing the disapproval is resolved. In either case, the Contractor shall resume work only when the Contracting Officer approves the work plan.
                (d) This clause does not change the requirements of the “Level of Effort” clause, nor the notification requirements of either the “Limitation of Cost” or “Limitation of Funds” clauses.
                (e) Work assignments shall not allow for any change to the terms or conditions of the contract. Where any language in the work assignment may suggest a change to the terms or conditions, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.

                  Alternate I (APR 1984). As prescribed in 1511.011-74(b)(1), modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:
                (f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict of interest (COI) certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a COI certification for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential COIs, but no additional COI certifications are required.
                Before submitting the COI certification, the Contractor shall search its records accumulated, at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document. In the COI certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief that all actual or potential organizational COIs have been reported to the Contracting Officer, or that to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational COIs exist. In addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational COIs to the Contractor. The COI certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report any actual or potential COI arising during performance of this work assignment or other work related to this site.
                
                  Alternate II (APR 1984). As prescribed in 1511.011-74(b)(1), modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:
                (f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict of interest (COI) certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a COI certification for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential COIs, but no additional COI certifications are required.

                Before submitting the COI certification, the Contractor shall initially search through all of its available records to identify any actual or potential COIs. During the first three years of this contract, the Contractor shall search through all records created since the beginning of the contract plus the records of the Contractor prior to the award of the contract until a minimum of three years of records are accumulated. Once three years of records have accumulated, prior to certifying, the Contractor shall search its records accumulated, at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document. In the COI certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all actual or potential organizational COIs have been reported to the Contracting Officer, or that to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational COIs exist. In addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational COIs to the Contractor. The COI certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report any actual or potential COI arising during performance of this work assignment or other work related to this site.

              Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals.
              As prescribed in 1515.408(a)(1) insert the following provision:
              
                
                Instructions for the Preparation of Proposals (AUG 1999)
                (a) Other than cost proposal instructions. (1) Submit proposal for than cost factors as a separate part of the total proposal package. Omit all cost or pricing details from this proposal.
                (2) Special proposal instructions:
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                (b) Cost or pricing proposal instructions. The offeror shall prepare and submit cost or pricing information data and supporting attachments in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408. In addition to a hard copy of the information, to expedite review of the proposal, submit an IBM-compatible software or storage device (e.g., USB flash drive or card reader) containing the financial data required, if this information is available using a commercial spreadsheet program on a personal computer. Submit this information using Microsoft Exchange 365, if available. Identify which version of Microsoft Exchange used. If the offeror used another spreadsheet program, indicate the software program used to create this information. Offerors should include the formulas and factors used in calculating the financial data. Although submission of a compatible software or device will expedite review, failure to submit a disk will not affect consideration of the proposal.
                (1) General—Submit cost or pricing information prepared in accordance with FAR Table 15-2, Instructions for Submitting Cost/Price Proposals When Cost or Pricing Information Are Required and the following:
                (i) Clearly identify separate cost or pricing information associated with any:
                (A) Options to extend the term of the contract;
                (B) Options for the Government to order incremental quantities; and/or
                (C) Major tasks, if required by the special instructions.
                (ii) If the contract schedule includes a “Fixed Rate for Services” clause, please provide in the cost proposal a schedule duplicating the format in the clause and include proposed fixed hourly rates per labor category for the base and any optional contract periods.
                (iii) If the contract includes the clause at FAR 52.232-7, “Payments Under Time and Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts,” include in the cost proposal the estimated costs and burden rate to be applied to materials, other direct costs, or subcontracts. The Government will include these costs as part of its cost proposal evaluation.
                (iv) If other divisions, subsidiaries, a parent or affiliated companies will perform work, provide the name and location of such affiliate and offeror's intercompany pricing policy. Separately identify costs and supporting data for each entity proposed.
                (v) The realism of costs, including personnel compensation rates (including effective hourly rates due to uncompensated overtime) will be part of the proposal evaluation. Any reductions to proposed costs or differences between proposed and known EPA/DCAA recommended rates must be fully explained. If an offeror makes a reduction which makes its offer or portions of its offer below anticipated costs, the offeror shall identify where (i.e., which elements of costs) the proposed reductions will be made. Unsubstantiated rates may result in an upward or downward adjustment of the cost proposals to reflect more realistic costs. Based on this analysis, a projected cost for the offeror will be calculated to reflect the Government's estimate of the offeror's probable costs. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between the promised performance and cost or price should be explained. The burden of proof for cost credibility rests with the offeror.
                (2) Direct labor. (i) The direct technical labor hours (level-of-effort) appearing in the solicitation are for professional and technical labor only. These hours do not include management at a level higher than project management, e.g., corporate and day-to-day management, nor do they include clerical and support staff at a level lower than technician. If it is the offeror's normal practice to charge these types of costs as direct costs, include these costs along with an estimate of the directly chargeable labor-hours for these personnel. These direct charges are to be shown separately from the technical (level-of-effort) effort. If this type of effort is normally included in the offeror's indirect cost allocations, no estimate is required. However, direct charging of these on any resulting contract will not be allowed. Additionally the direct technical labor hours are the workable hours required by the Government and do not include release time (i.e., holidays, vacation, etc.) Submit the proposal utilizing the labor categories and distribution of the level-of-effort specified in the solicitation. These are approximate distribution levels and do not necessarily represent the actual levels which may be experienced during contract performance.

                (ii) Explain the basis of the proposed labor rates, including a complete justification for all judgmental factors used to develop weights applied to company's category or individual rates that comprise the rates for labor categories specified in the solicitation. This explanation should describe how technical approach coincides with the proposed costs. If the proposed direct labor rates are based on an average of the individuals proposed to work on the contract, provide a list of the individuals proposed and the hours associated with each individual in deriving the rates. If the proposed direct labor rates are based on an average of company category rates, identify and describe the labor categories and the percentages associated with each category in deriving the rates, explaining in detail the basis for the percentages assigned.
                (iii) Describe for each labor category proposed, the company's qualifications and experience requirements. If individual rates are used, provide the employee's name. If specific individuals are identified in the technical proposal, correlate these individuals with the labor categories specified in the solicitation.
                (iv) Provide a matrix summarizing the effort proposed, including the subcontracts, by professional and technical level specified in the solicitation.
                (v) Indicate whether current rates or escalated rates are used. If escalation is included, state the degree (percent) and methodology. The methodology shall include the effective date of the base rates and the policy on salary reviews (e.g. anniversary date of employee or salary reviews for all employees on a specific date).
                (vi) State whether any additional direct labor (new hire or temporary hires) will be required during the performance period of this acquisition. If so, state the number required, the professional or technical level and the methodology used to estimate proposed labor rates.
                (vii) With respect to educational institutions, include the following information for those professional staff members whose salary is expected to be covered by a stipulated salary support agreement pursuant to OMB Circular A-21.
                (A) Individual's name;
                (B) Annual salary and the period for which the salary is applicable;
                (C) List of other research Projects or proposals for which salaries are allocated, and the proportionate time charged to each; and
                (D) Other duties, such as teaching assignments, administrative assignments, and other institutional activities. Show the proportionate time charged to each. (Show proportionate time charges as a percentage of 100% of time for the entire academic year, exclusive of vacation or sabbatical leave.)
                (viii) Uncompensated overtime. The decision to propose uncompensated overtime is the offeror's decision. Should the offeror, however, elect to propose uncompensated overtime, the offeror must propose a methodology that is consistent with their cost accounting practices and company policy. If proposed, provide an estimate of any uncompensated overtime proposed for exempt personnel working at the offeror's facilities. This estimate should identify the number of uncompensated labor hours and the percentage of compensated labor. Uncompensated labor hours are defined as hours for exempt personnel in excess of regular hours for a pay period which are actually worked and recorded in accordance with company policy. Provide a copy of the company policy on uncompensated overtime. Provide historical percentages of uncompensated overtime for the past three years. If proposed for subcontractors, provide separately with subcontractor information.
                (ix) For labor rate contracts, for each fixed labor rate, offerors shall identify the basis for the loaded fixed hourly rate for each contract period for example, the rate might consist of the following cost elements: raw wage or salary rate, plus fringe benefits (if applicable), plus overhead rate (if applicable), plus G&A expense rate (if applicable), plus profit.
                When determining the composite raw wage for a labor category, the offeror shall:
                (A) provide in narrative form the basis for the raw wage for each labor category. If actual wages of current employees are used, the basis for the projections should be explained.
                (B) If employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or Davis Bacon Act, they must be compensated at least at the minimum wage rate required by the applicable Wage Determination.
                (3) Indirect costs (fringe, overhead, general, and administrative expenses). (i) If the rates have been recently approved, include a copy of the rate agreement. If the agreement does not cover the projected performance period of the proposed effort, provide the rationale and any estimated rate calculations for the proposed performance period.
                (ii) Submit supporting documentation for rates which have not been approved or audited. Indicate whether computations are based upon historical or projected data.
                (iii) Provide actual pool expenses, base dollars, or hours (as applicable for the past five years). Include the actual indirect rates for the past five years including the indirect rates proposed, the actual indirect rates experienced and, if available, the final negotiated rate. Indicate the amount of unallowable costs included in the historical data.

                (iv) Offerors who propose indirect rates for new or substantially reorganized cost centers should consider offering to accept ceilings on the indirect rates at the proposed rates. Similarly, offerors whose subcontractors propose indirect rates for new or substantially reorganized cost centers should likewise consider offering to accept ceilings on the subcontractors' indirect rates at the proposed rates.
                
                
                  Note to paragraph (b)(3)(iv):

                  The Government reserves the right to adjust an offeror's or its subcontractor's estimated indirect costs for evaluation purposes based on the Agency's judgment of the most probable costs up to the amount of any stated ceiling.
                
                
                (v) If the employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or Davis Bacon Act, employees must receive the minimum level of benefits stated in the applicable Wage Determination.
                (4) Travel expense. (i) If the solicitation specifies the amount of travel costs, this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect costs and fee.
                (ii) If the solicitation does not specify the amount of travel costs, attach a schedule illustrating how travel was computed. Include a breakdown indicating number of trips, number of travelers, destinations from and to, purpose and cost, e.g., mileage, transportation costs, subsistence rates.
                (5) Equipment, facilities and special equipment, including tooling. (i) If direct charges for use of existing contractor equipment are proposed, provide a description of these items, including estimated usage hours, rates, and total costs.
                (ii) If equipment purchases are proposed, provide a description of these items, and a justification as to why the Government should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds. (Unless specified elsewhere in this solicitation, FAR 45.302-1 requires contractors to furnish all facilities in performance of contracts with certain limited exceptions.)
                (iii) Identify Government-owned property in the possession of the offeror or proposed to be used in the performance of the contract, and the Government agency which has cognizance over the property.
                (iv) Submit proposed rates or use charges for equipment, along with documentation to support those rates.
                (v) If special purposes facilities or equipment are being proposed, provide a description of these items, details for the proposed costs including competitive prices, and justification as to why the Government should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.
                (vi) If fabrication by the prime contractor is contemplated, include details of material, labor, and overhead.
                (6) Other Direct Costs (ODC). (i) If the solicitation specifies the amount of other direct costs, this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect cost and fee.
                (ii) If the amount is not specified in the solicitation, attach a schedule detailing how other direct costs were computed. Identify the major ODC items that under the accounting system would be a direct charge on any resulting contract.
                (iii) If any of the cost elements identified as part of the specified other direct costs are recovered as an indirect cost, in accordance with the offeror's accounting system, those costs should not be included as a direct cost. Complete explanation of this adjustment and the contractor's practice should be provided.
                (iv) Provide historical other direct costs dollars per level of effort hour on similar contracts or work assignments.
                (7) Team subcontracts. When the cost of a subcontract is substantial (5 percent of the total estimated contract dollar value or $100,000, whichever is less), the offeror shall include the following subcontractor information:
                (i) Provide details of subcontract costs in the same format as the prime contractor's costs. This detailed information may be provided separately to the EPA if the subcontractor does not wish to provide this data to the prime contractor. Cost data provided separately by a contractor must be received by the time, date and at the location specified for the receipt of proposals. The subcontractor's package should be clearly marked with the RFP number, the name of the prime offeror, and a statement that the package is subcontractor data relevant to the proposal from the prime offeror. If submitted with the prime contractor's proposal, identify the subcontractors. State the amount of service estimated to be required and the quoted daily or hourly rate. Offerors are encouraged to provide letters of intent, signed by subcontractors, agreeing to a specified rate for life of the contract. Include a cost or price analysis of the subcontractor cost showing the reasons why the costs are considered reasonable;
                (ii) Describe how the prospective team subcontractors were chosen as part of the offeror's proposed team; and rationale for selection;
                (iii) Describe the necessity for the subcontractor's effort as either a supplement or complement to the offeror's in-house expertise;
                (iv) Identify the areas of the scope of work and the level of effort the subcontractors are anticipated to perform. Provide a reconciliation summary of the proposed hours and ODCs for the prime contractor and proposed subcontractor(s).
                (v) Describe the prime contractor's management structure and internal controls to ensure efficient and quality performance of team subcontractors.
                (8) Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM). When an offeror elects to claim FCCM as an allowable cost, the offeror must submit Form CASB-CNF and show calculation of the proposed amount. FCCM will be an allowable cost under the contemplated contract, if the criteria for allowability at FAR 31.205-10(a)(2) are met.
              
              (End of provision)
              
              
                Alternate I (AUG 1999). If the Government's requirement is a fully dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified position and performance is on a Government facility, add the following paragraph (b)(2)(x) to the basic provision:
              
              
                (x) The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in work years. A work year is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive of direct and indirect time (40 hours per week × 52 weeks per year = 2080 hours). The proposal must identify proposed work years and clearly identify how many hours in each work year are direct (i.e., productive working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e., paid absences). If the company policy includes a different base work week, the total available hours would be different. For example, if the company's policy calls for a 37.5 hour work week, offeror would deduct paid absences from 1950 hour (37.5 hours/week × 52 weeks/year = 1950 hours). Offeror should clearly identify the paid absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how many hours are for vacation and sick leave. The amount of indirect time (paid absences) identified in the proposal must be consistent with company policy and must allow for the ten Federal government holidays.
              
              
              
                Alternate II (AUG 1999). If the Government's requirement is a fully dedicated staff person for a twelve month period(s) for each specified position and performance is not on a Government facility; add the following paragraph (b)(2)(x) to the basic provision:
              
              
                (x) The level of effort for each position is to be proposed in work years. A work year is considered to consist of 2080 hours inclusive of direct and indirect time (40 hours per week × 52 weeks per year = 2080 hours). The proposal must identify proposed work years and clearly identify how many hours in each work year are direct (i.e., productive working hours) and how many are indirect (i.e., paid absences). If the company policy includes a different base work week, the total available hours would be different. For example, if the company's policy calls for a 37.5 hour work week, offeror would deduct paid absences from 1950 hour (37.5 hours/week × 52 weeks/year = 1950 hours). Offeror should clearly identify the paid absences as to how many hours are for holiday and how many hours are for vacation and sick leave.
              
              
              
                Alternate III (AUG 1999). If the requirement is for the acquisition of supplies or equipment, substitute the following paragraphs (a)(iv)-(viii) and add (a)(ix) and (b).
              
              
                (iv) Provide information as to how the proposed supplies or equipment meet the salient characteristics required by the contract line item;
                (v) Provide published brochures, catalogs, or other technical literature by contract line item;
                (vi) Meet any interface or compatibility requirements by contract line item;
                (vii) Describe warranty services and how delivered by contract line item;
                (viii) Assumptions, deviations and exceptions (as necessary); and
                (ix) Additional information.
                (b) Supplies—Provide unit pricing by contract line items for:
                (i) each line item;
                (ii) delivery;
                (iii) installation;
                (iv) sets of operating manuals;
                (v) training;
                (vi) warranty;
                (vii) maintenance; and
                (viii) volume discounts.

                Advanced Understanding—Uncompensated Time (AUG 1999)
                (a) The estimated cost of this contract is based upon the Contractor's proposal which specified that exempt personnel identified to work at the Contractor's facilities will provide uncompensated labor hours to the contract totaling __ percent of compensated labor. (Note: the commitment for uncompensated time, and the formula elements in paragraph (b) below, apply only to exempt personnel working at the Contractor's facilities and does not include non-exempt personnel or exempt personnel working at other facilities.) Uncompensated labor hours are defined as hours of exempt personnel in excess of regular hours for a __ pay period which are actually worked and recorded in accordance with the company policy, entitled, __________.
                (b) Recognizing that the probable cost to the Government for the labor provided under this contract is calculated assuming a proposed level of uncompensated labor hours, it is hereby agreed that in the event the proposed level of uncompensated labor hours are not provided, an adjustment, calculated in accordance with the following formula will be made to the contract amount.
                Formula:
                Adjustment equals estimated value of uncompensated time hours not provided.
                Target uncompensated time percent minus __ percent.
                Shortage of uncompensated time percent minus actual cost percent.
                Estimated value of uncompensated time hours not provided equals shortage of uncompensated time percent times total exempt applicable direct labor costs (including applicable indirect costs).
                (c) Within three weeks after the end of the contract, the Contractor shall submit a statement concerning the amount of uncompensated time hours delivered during the contract. In the event there is a shortage of uncompensated time hours provided, a calculation, utilizing the above formula will be made and this calculation will be the basis for an adjustment in the contract amount.
                (d) In the event adjustments are made to the contract, the adjusted amounts shall not be allowable as a direct or indirect cost to this or any other Government contract.

                Past Performance Information (OCT 2000)
                (a) Offerors shall submit the information requested below as part of their proposal for both the offeror and any proposed subcontractors for subcontracts expected to exceed $ * . The information may be submitted prior to other parts of the proposal in order to assist the Government in reducing the evaluation period.
                (b) Offerors shall submit a list of all or at least * contracts and subcontracts completed in the last * years, and all contracts and subcontracts currently in process, which are similar in nature to this requirement.
                (1) The contracts and subcontracts listed may include those entered into with Federal, State and local governments, and commercial businesses, which are of similar scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to the requirement which is described in the RFP. Include the following information for each contract and subcontract listed:
                (a) Name of contracting activity.
                (b) Contract number.
                (c) Contract title.
                (d) Contract type.

                (f) Total contract value.
                (g) Period of performance.

                (l) Compliance with subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged business concerns, monetary targets for small disadvantaged business participation, and the notifications submitted under FAR 19.1202-4 (b), if applicable.
                (c) Offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts and subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references.
                (1) Offerors may provide information on problems encountered and corrective actions taken on the identified contracts and subcontracts.
                (2) References that may be contacted by the Government include the contracting officer, program manager/project officer, or the administrative contracting officer identified above.
                (3) If no response is received from a reference, the Government will make an attempt to contact another reference identified by the offeror, to contact a reference not identified by the offeror, or to complete the evaluation with those references who responded. The Government shall consider the information provided by the references, and may also consider information obtained from other sources, when evaluating an offeror's past performance.
                (4) Attempts to obtain responses from references will generally not go beyond two telephonic messages and/or written requests from the Government, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. The Government is not obligated to contact all of the references identified by the offeror.
                (d) If negative feedback is received from an offeror's reference, the Government will compare the negative response to the responses from the offeror's other references to note differences. A score will be assigned appropriately to the offeror based on the information. The offeror will be given the opportunity to address adverse past performance information obtained from references on which the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to comment, if that information makes a difference in the Government's decision to include the offeror in or exclude the offeror from the competitive range. Any past performance deficiency or significant weakness will be discussed with offerors in the competitive range during discussions.
                (e) Offerors must send Client Authorization Letters (see Section J of the solicitation) to each reference listed in their proposal to assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation. Offerors are encouraged to consolidate requests whenever possible (i.e., if the same reference has several contracts, send that reference a single notice citing all applicable contracts). Offerors may send Client Authorization Letters electronically to references with copies forwarded to the contracting officer.
                (1) If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, an offeror must affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance history.
                (2) Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or E-mailed to individual references no later than five (5) working days after proposal submission. The offeror should forward a copy of the Client Authorization Letter to the contracting officer simultaneously with mailing to references.
                (f) Each offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, other Government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications.
                (1) Identify the segment of the company (one division or the entire company) which received the award or certification.
                (2) Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply.
                (g) Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor for award. The Past Performance Questionnaire identified in section J will be used to collect information on an offeror's performance under existing and prior contracts/subcontracts for products or services similar in scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement in order to evaluate offerors consistent with the past performance evaluation factor set forth in section M. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.
                (h) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past performance will be maintained in the official contract file.

                (i) In accordance with FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv), offerors with no relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past performance.

                (d) Prior to the placement of any task/delivery order, the Contractor will be provided with a proposed Performance Work Statement/Statement of Work and will be asked to respond with detailed technical and cost proposals within __ calendar days or less. The technical proposal will delineate the Contractor's interpretation for the execution of the PWS/SOW, and the pricing proposal will be the Contractor's best estimate for the hours, labor categories and all costs associated with the execution.

                Award Term Incentive (FEB 2008)
                (a) General. This contract may be extended as set forth in paragraph (b) based on overall contractor performance as evaluated in accordance with the Clause entitled “Award Term Incentive Plan,” provided the Agency has a need for the effort at or before the time an award term is to commence, and if the contractor receives notice of the availability of funding for an award term period pursuant to the “Award Term Availability of Funds” clause. The Contracting Officer is responsible for the overall award term evaluation and award term decision. The Contracting Officer will unilaterally decide whether or not the contractor is eligible for an award term extension, and in conjunction with the Contracting Officer's Representative, will determine the need for continued performance and funding availability.
                (b) Period of performance. Provided the contractor has achieved the performance measures, e.g., acceptable quality levels, set forth in the clause “Award Term Incentive Plan,” the Contracting Officer may extend the contract by exercising ____ [insert the total award term incentive periods] additional award term incentive period(s) of ____ [insert the award term incentive period] months each. The total maximum period of performance under this contract, if the Government exercises any option periods and all award term incentive periods is ____ [insert the total of the base period, option periods (if any), and award term incentive periods] years.
                (c) Right not to grant or cancel the award term incentive. (1) The Government has the unilateral right not to grant or to cancel award term incentive periods and the associated award term incentive plans if—
                (i) The Contracting Officer has failed to initiate an award term incentive period, regardless of whether the contractor's performance permitted the Contracting Officer to consider initiating the award term incentive period; or
                (ii) The contractor has failed to achieve the performance measures for the corresponding evaluation period; or
                (iii) The Government notifies the contractor in writing it does not have funds available for the award term incentive periods; or
                (iv) The Government no longer has a need for the award term incentive period at or before the time an award term incentive period is to commence.

                (2) When an award term incentive period is not granted or cancelled, any—
                
                (i) Prior award term incentive periods for which the contractor remains otherwise eligible are unaffected.
                (ii) Subsequent award term incentive periods are thereby also cancelled.
                (d) Cancellation of an award term incentive period that has not yet commenced for any of the reasons set forth in paragraph (c) of this clause shall not be considered either a termination for convenience or termination for default, and shall not entitle the contractor to any termination settlement or any other compensation. If the award term incentive is cancelled, a unilateral modification will cite this clause as the authority.
                (e) Award term incentive administration. The award term incentive evaluation(s) will be completed in accordance with the schedule in the Award Term Incentive Plan. The contractor will be notified of the results and their eligibility to be considered for the respective award term incentive no later than 120 days after an evaluation period.
                (f) Review process. The contractor may request a review of an award term incentive evaluation which has resulted in the contractor being ineligible for the award term incentive.

                  Note to paragraph (i)—Any costs requiring advance consent by the Contracting Officer will be considered improper and will be suspended, if claimed prior to receipt of Contracting Officer consent. Include the total cost claimed for the current and cumulative-to-date periods. After the total amount claimed, provide summary dollar amounts of cumulative costs:
                1. Suspended as of the date of the invoice; and

Detailed reporting is not required for local travel. The manner of breakdown, e.g., task order/delivery order basis with/without separate program management, contract period will be specified in the contract instructions.
                
                  Note to paragraph (j)—Any costs requiring advance consent by the Contracting Officer will be considered improper and will be suspended, if claimed prior to receipt of Contracting Officer consent. Include the total cost claimed for the current and cumulative-to-date periods. After the total amount claimed, provide summary dollar amounts of cumulative costs:
                1. Suspended as of the date of the invoice; and

                2. Disallowed on the contract as of the date of the invoice.
                
                The amount shall include costs originally suspended and later disallowed. Also include an explanation of the changes in cumulative costs suspended or disallowed by addressing each adjustment in terms of: voucher number, date, dollar amount, source, and reason for the adjustment. Disallowed costs should be identified in unallowable accounts in the contractor's accounting system.
                (k) Resubmissions. When an original voucher was submitted, but not paid in full because of suspended costs and after receipt of a letter of removal of suspension, resubmissions of any previously claimed amounts which were suspended should be submitted in a separate invoice showing the original voucher number and designated with the letter “R” with the copy of the removal of suspension notice. The amounts should be shown under the appropriate cost category and include all appropriate supplemental schedules.
                
                  Note to paragraph (k)—All disallowances must be identified as such in the accounting system through journal entries.
                (l) Adjustment Vouchers. Adjustment vouchers should be submitted if finalized indirect rates were received but the rates are not for the entire period of performance. For example, the base period of performance is for a calendar year but your indirect rates are by fiscal year. Hence, only part of the base period can be adjusted for the applicable final indirect rates. These invoices should be annotated with “adj” after the invoice number.
                
                (m) Final Vouchers. Final Vouchers shall be submitted if finalized rates have been received for the entire period of performance. For example, the base period of performance is for a calendar year but your indirect rates are by fiscal year. You have received finalized rates for the entire base period that encompass both fiscal years that cover the base period. In accordance with FAR 52.216-7, these invoices shall be submitted within 60 days after settlement of final indirect cost rates. They should be annotated with the word “Final” or “F” after the invoice number. Due to system limitations, the invoice number cannot be more than 11 characters to include spaces.
                (n) Completion Vouchers. In accordance with FAR 52.216-7(d)(5), a completion voucher shall be submitted within 120 days (or longer if approved in writing by the Contracting Officer) after settlement of the final annual indirect cost rates for all years of a physically complete contract. The voucher shall reflect the settled amounts and rates. It shall include settled subcontract amounts and rates. The prime contractor is responsible for settling subcontractor amounts and rates included in the completion invoice. Since EPA's invoices must be on a period of performance basis, the contractor shall have a completion invoice for each year of the period of performance. This voucher must be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval before final payment can be made on the contract. The Contracting Officer may request an audit of the completion vouchers before final payment is made. In addition, once approved, the Contracting Officer will request the appropriate closeout paperwork for the contract. For contracts separately invoiced by delivery or task order, provide a schedule showing final total costs claimed by delivery or task order and in total for the contract. In addition to the completion voucher, the contractor must submit the Contractor's Release; Assignee's Release, if applicable; the Contractor's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates, Credits and other Amounts; the Assignee's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates, Credits and other Amounts, if applicable; and the Contractor's Affidavit of Waiver of Lien, when required by the contract.

                (2) The invoice or request for contract financing payment that employs a fixed rate feature shall include current and cumulative charges by contract labor category and by other major cost elements such as travel, equipment, and other direct costs. For current costs, each cost element shall include the appropriate supporting schedules identified in the invoice preparation instructions.

                Release of Contractor Confidential Business Information (DEC 2018)
                (a) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may find it necessary to release information submitted by the Contractor either in response to this solicitation or pursuant to the provisions of this contract, to individuals not employed by EPA. Business information that is ordinarily entitled to confidential treatment under existing EPA regulations (40 CFR part 2) may be included in the information released to these individuals. Accordingly, by submission of this proposal or signature on this contract or other contracts, the Contractor hereby consents to a limited release of its confidential business information (CBI). An EPA contractor may assert a business confidentiality claim covering part or all of the information submitted by the contractor in a manner that is consistent with 40 CFR 2.203(b). If no such CBI claim accompanies the information when it is received by EPA, it may be made available to the public by EPA without further notice to the EPA contactor, pursuant to 40 CFR 2.203(a), and will not require the additional measures set forth in this section.
                (b) Possible circumstances where the EPA may release the Contractor's CBI include, but are not limited to the following:
                (1) To EPA contractors and other federal agencies and their contractors tasked with recovery, or assisting the Agency in the recovery, of Federal funds expended pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9607, as amended, (CERCLA or Superfund) and/or Sec. 311(c) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) (33 U.S.C. 1321(c));
                (2) To the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and contractors employed by DOJ for use in advising the EPA and representing the EPA or other federal agencies in procedures for the recovery of Superfund expenditures and costs and damages to be deposited to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF);
                (3) To the U.S. Department of the Treasury and contractors employed by that department for use in collecting costs to be deposited to the Superfund or the OSLTF;
                (4) To parties liable, or potentially liable, for costs under CERCLA Sec. 107 (42 U.S.C. 9607), OPA Sec. 1002 (33 U.S.C. 2702), or CWA Sec. 311 (33 U.S.C. 1321) and their insurers or guarantors (`Potentially Responsible Parties') for purposes of facilitating collection, settlement or litigation of claims against such parties;

                (5) To EPA contractors who, for purposes of performing the work required under the respective contracts, require access to information that the Agency obtained under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); the CWA (33 U.S.C.1251 et seq.); the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.); the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.); the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.); CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.); or the OPA (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.);

                (6) To EPA contractors tasked with assisting the Agency in handling and processing information and documents in the administration of Agency contracts, such as providing both preaward and post award audit support and specialized technical support to the Agency's technical evaluation panels;
                (7) To employees of grantees working at EPA under the Senior Environmental Employment (SEE) Program;
                (8) To Speaker of the House, President of the Senate, or Chairman of a Congressional Committee or Subcommittee;
                (9) To entities such as the United States Government Accountability Office, boards of contract appeals, and the Courts in the resolution of solicitation or contract protests and disputes;
                (10) To EPA contractor employees engaged in information systems analysis, development, operation, and maintenance, including performing data processing and management functions for the EPA; and
                (11) Pursuant to a court order or court-supervised agreement.
                (c) The EPA recognizes an obligation to protect the contractor from competitive harm that may result from the release of such information to a competitor. (See also the clauses in this document entitled “Screening Business Information for Claims of Confidentiality” and “Treatment of Confidential Business Information.”) Except where otherwise provided by law, CBI shall be released under paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of this clause only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.
                (d) With respect to EPA contractors, EPAAR § 1552.235-71 will be used as the confidentiality agreement. With respect to contractors for other federal agencies, EPA will expect these agencies to enter into similar confidentiality agreements with their contractors. With respect to Potentially Responsible Parties, such confidentiality agreements may permit further disclosure to other entities where necessary to further settlement or litigation of claims under CERCLA, the CWA, or the OPA. Such entities include, but are not limited to, accounting firms and technical experts able to analyze the information, provided that they also agree to be bound by an appropriate confidentiality agreement.
                (e) This clause does not authorize the EPA to release the Contractor's CBI to the public pursuant to a request filed under the Freedom of Information Act.
                (f) The Contractor agrees to include this clause, including this paragraph (f), in all subcontracts at all levels awarded pursuant to this contract that require the furnishing of confidential business information by the subcontractor.

                (2) Evaluation and acceptance of reports or other deliverables.
                (c) Technical direction must be within the scope of work of the contract and any task order there under. The Contracting Officer's Representative(s) does not have the authority to issue technical direction which:

                (e) If, in the contractor's opinion, any instruction or direction by the Contracting Officer's Representative(s) falls within any of the categories defined in paragraph (c) of the clause, the contractor shall not proceed but shall notify the contracting officer in writing within 3 days after receiving it and shall request that the contracting officer take appropriate action as described in this paragraph. Upon receiving this notification, the contracting officer shall:
                (1) Advise the contractor in writing as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days after receipt of the contractor's notification, that the technical direction is within the scope of the contract effort and does not constitute a change under the “Changes” clause of the contract;
                (2) Advise the contractor within a reasonable time that the government will issue a written modification to the contract; or
                (3) Advise the contractor that the technical direction is outside the scope of the contract and is thereby rescinded.
                (f) A failure of the contractor and contracting officer to agree as to whether the technical direction is within the scope of the contract, or a failure to agree upon the contract action to be taken with respect thereto, shall be subject to the provisions of the clause entitled “Disputes” in this contract.
                (g) Any action(s) taken by the contractor, in response to any direction given by any person acting on behalf of the government or any government official other than the contracting officer or the Contracting Officer's Representative, shall be at the contractor's risk.

                Government-Contractor Relations (JUN 1999)
                (a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the contractor to the Government are non-personal services and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties a full understanding of their respective obligations.
                (b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:
                (1) Be placed in a position where they are under the supervision, direction, or evaluation of a Government employee.
                (2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration or control over Government personnel, or over personnel of other Contractors under other EPA contracts, or become a part of the Government organization.
                (3) Be used in administration or supervision of Government procurement activities.
                (c) Employee relationship. (1) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or his/her personnel to exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.
                (2) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.
                (d) Inapplicability of employee benefits. This contract does not create an employer-employee relationship. Accordingly, entitlements and benefits applicable to such relationships do not apply.
                (1) Payments by the Government under this contract are not subject to Federal income tax withholdings.
                (2) Payments by the Government under this contract are not subject to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act.
                (3) The Contractor is not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits under the Social Security Act, as amended, by virtue of performance of this contract.
                (4) The Contractor is not entitled to workman's compensation benefits by virtue of this contract.
                (5) The entire consideration and benefits to the Contractor for performance of this contract is contained in the provisions for payment under this contract.
                (e) Notice. It is the Contractor's, as well as, the Government's responsibility to monitor contract activities and notify the Contracting Officer if the Contractor believes that the intent of this clause has been or may be violated.

                (1) The Contractor should notify the Contracting Officer in writing promptly, within ____ (to be negotiated and inserted into the basic contract at contract award) calendar days from the date of any incident that the Contractor considers to constitute a violation of this clause. The notice should include the date, nature and circumstance of the conduct, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor official or employee involved or knowledgeable about such conduct, identify any documents or substance of any oral communication involved in the conduct, and the estimate in time by which the Government must respond to this notice to minimize cost, delay or disruption of performance.
                (2) The Contracting Officer will promptly, within ____ (to be negotiated and inserted into the basic contract at contract award) calendar days after receipt of notice, respond to the notice in writing. In responding, the Contracting Officer will either:
                (i) Confirm that the conduct is in violation and when necessary direct the mode of further performance,
                (ii) Countermand any communication regarded as a violation,
                (iii) Deny that the conduct constitutes a violation and when necessary direct the mode of further performance; or
                (iv) In the event the notice is inadequate to make a decision, advise the Contractor what additional information is required, and establish the date by which it should be furnished by the Contractor and the date thereafter by which the Government will respond.

                Indirect Costs (SEP 2017)
                (a) In accordance with paragraph (d) of the “Allowable Cost and Payment” clause, the final indirect cost rates applicable to this contract shall be established between the Contractor and the appropriate Government representative (EPA, other Government agency, or auditor), as provided by FAR 42.703-1(a). EPA's procedures require a Contracting Officer determination of indirect cost rates for its contracts. In those cases where EPA is the cognizant agency (see FAR 42.705-1), the final rate proposal shall be submitted to the cognizant audit activity and to the following designated Contracting Officer: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Manager, Financial Analysis and Oversight Service Center, Mail Code 3802R, Policy, Training Oversight Division, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20460.
                Where EPA is not the cognizant agency, the final rate proposal shall be submitted to the above-cited address, to the cognizant audit agency, and to the designated Contracting Officer of the cognizant agency. Upon establishment of the final indirect cost rates, the Contractor shall submit an executed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data (see FAR 15.406-2) applicable to the data furnished in connection with the final rates to the cognizant audit agency. The final rates shall be contained in a written understanding between the Contractor and the appropriate Government representative. Pursuant to the “Allowable Cost and Payment” clause, the allowable indirect costs under this contract shall be obtained by applying the final agreed upon rate(s) to the appropriate bases.
                (b) Until final annual indirect cost rates are established for any period, the Government shall reimburse the contractor at billing rates established by the appropriate Government representative in accordance with FAR 42.704, subject to adjustment when the final rates are established. The established billing rates are currently as follows:

                These billing rates may be prospectively or retroactively revised by mutual agreement, at the request of either the Government or the Contractor, to prevent substantial overpayment or underpayment.
                (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause, ceilings are hereby established on indirect costs reimbursable under this contract. The Government shall not be obligated to pay the Contractor any additional amount on account of indirect costs in excess of the ceiling rates listed below:

                Contract Property Administration Requirements
                1. Purpose. This document sets forth the requirements for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contractors performing Government property management responsibilities under EPA contracts. These requirements supplement those contained in the Government Property clause(s) and Part 45 Government Property of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
                2. Contract Property Administration (CPAR)
                
                a. EPA Delegation. EPA delegates all contract property administration to the EPA Contract Property Coordinator (CPC). The delegations apply to all EPA contracts issued with or that have the potential to receive, purchase or acquire Government Property or include the Government Property clauses. In addition to administering all contract property, the CPC provides technical expertise and assistance to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) relative to Government Property.
                
                b. DCMA Re-delegation. The CPC may request support for contract property management oversight, including property administration and plant clearance, from the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). If DCMA agrees to provide support, DCMA will notify the contractor of the assigned property administrator (PA) and plant clearance officer (PLCO). The DCMA PA is available to the contractor for assistance in all matters of property administration. Notwithstanding the delegation, as necessary, the contractor may contact the EPA CO. In the event of a disagreement between the contractor and the DCMA PA, the contractor should seek resolution from the CO. Unless, otherwise directed in the contract, or this document, all originals of written information or reports, except direct correspondence between the contractor and the DCMA PA, relative to Government property, should be forwarded to the administrative CO assigned to this contract and the CPC.
                c. Disagreements. Notwithstanding the delegation(s), as necessary, the contractor may contact the CO. In the event of a disagreement between the contractor and the PA or the CPC the contractor should seek resolution from the CO.
                3. Requests for Government Property.
                
                In accordance with FAR 45.102, the contractor shall furnish all property required for performing Government contracts. If a contractor believes that Government property is required for performance of the contract, the contractor shall submit a written request to the CO. At a minimum, the request shall contain the following elements:
                a. Contract number for which the property is required.
                b. An item(s) description, quantity and estimated cost.
                c. Certification that no like contractor property exists which could be utilized.
                d. A detailed description of the task-related purpose of the property.
                e. Explanation of negative impact if property is not provided by the Government.
                f. Lease versus purchase analysis shall be furnished with the request to acquire property on behalf of the Government, with the exception of requests for material purchases. The contractor may not proceed with acquisition of property on behalf of the Government until receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer.
                4. Transfer of Government Property. The Contracting Officer initiates the transfer of the government property via a contract modification. The transferor (EPA or another contractor) shall provide to the transferee, the receiving contractor, the information needed to establish and maintain the property records required of FAR 52.245-1, as well as all of the applicable data elements required by Attachment 1 of this clause. The transferee, the receiving contractor, should perform a complete inventory of the property before signing the acceptance document for the property. Accountability will transfer to the receiving contractor upon receipt and acceptance of the property, in accordance with FAR 45.106.
                5. Records of Government Property.
                
                a. In accordance with FAR 52.245-1, the contractor shall create and maintain records of all Government property, regardless of value, including property provided to and in the possession of a subcontractor. Material provided by the Government or acquired by the contractor and billed as a direct charge to the contract is Government property and records must be established as such.
                b. The Contractor shall identify all Superfund property and designate it as such both on the item and on the Government property record. If it is not practicable to tag the item, the contractor shall write the ID number on a tag, card or other entity that may be kept with the item or in a file.
                c. Support documentation used for posting entries to the property record shall provide complete, current and auditable data. Entries shall be posted to the record in a timely manner following an action.
                d. For Government vehicles, in addition to the data elements required by EPA, the contractor shall also comply with the General Services Administration (GSA) and Department of Energy (DOE) record and report requirements supplied with all EPA provided motor vehicles. If the above requirements were not provided with the vehicle, the contractor shall notify the designated CPC and the Fleet Manager.
                e. When Government property is disclosed to be in the management and/or control of the contractor but not provided under any contract, the contractor shall record and report the property in accordance with FAR 52.245-1.
                6. Inventories of Government Property. The contractor shall conduct a complete physical inventory of EPA property at least once per year. The contractor shall report the results of the inventory, including any discrepancies, to the CO. Reconciliation of discrepancies shall be completed in accordance with the schedule negotiated with the CO. See section 10 herein, Contract Closeout, for information on final inventories.
                7. Reports of Government Property. EPA requires an annual summary report, for each contract, by contract number, of Government property in the contractor's possession. The annual summary is due as of September 30th of each year, and upon contract termination or expiration.

                a. For each classification listed on the EPA Property Report form, with the exception of material, the contractor shall provide the total acquisition cost and total quantity. If there are zero items in a classification, or if there is an ending balance of zero, the classification must be listed with zeros in the quantity and acquisition cost columns.
                b. For material, the contractor shall provide the total acquisition cost only.
                c. Property classified as Plant Equipment, Superfund and Special Test Equipment must be reported on two separate lines. The first line shall include the total acquisition cost and quantity of all items or systems with a unit acquisition cost of $25,000 or more. The second line shall include the total acquisition cost and quantity of all items with a unit acquisition cost of less than $25,000.
                d. For items comprising a system, which is defined as “a group of interacting items functioning as a complex whole,” the contractor may maintain the record as a system noting all components of the system under the main component or maintain individual records for each item. However, for the annual report of Government property the components must be reported as a system with one total dollar amount for the system, if that system total is $25,000 or more.
                e. The reports are to be received at EPA by the CPC by October 5th of each year.
                f. Distribution shall be as follows:
                
                Original to: CPC
                One copy: CO
                
                g. Contractors are required to comply with GSA and DOE special reporting requirements for motor vehicles. A statement of these requirements will be provided by the EPA Facility Management and Services Division (FMSD) concurrent with receipt of each vehicle.
                h. The contractor shall provide detailed reports on an as-needed basis, as may be requested by the CO or the CPC.
                8. Disposition of Government Property. The disposition process is composed of three distinct phases: identification, reporting, and final disposition.
                a. Identification. The disposition process begins with the contractor identifying Government property that is no longer required for contract performance. Effective contract property management systems provide for identification of excess as it occurs. Once Government property has been determined to be excess to the accountable contract, it must be screened against the contractor's other EPA contracts for further use. If the property may be reutilized, the contractor shall notify the CO in writing. Government property will be transferred via contract modifications to other contracts only when the COs on both the current contract and the receiving contract authorize the transfer.
                b. Reporting.
                
                (i) EPA. Government property shall be reported in accordance with FAR 52.245-1. The Standard Form, SF 1428, Inventory Disposal Schedule, provides the format for reporting excess Government property. Instructions for completing and when to use the form may be found at FAR 52.245-1(j). Forward the completed SF 1428 to the CPC. The SF 1428 is available at http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/FormsStandard54.html. Superfund property must contain a Superfund notification and the following language must be displayed on the form: “Note to CO: Reimbursement to the EPA Superfund is required.”
                (ii) DCMA. If the EPA contract has been re-delegated to DCMA, the excess items will be entered into the Plant Clearance Automated Reutilization Screening System (PCARSS). Access and information pertaining to this system may be addressed to the DCMA Plant Clearance Officer (PLCO).
                c. Disposition Instructions.
                
                (i) Retention. When Government property is identified as excess, the CO may direct the contractor in writing to retain all or part of the excess Government Property under the current contract for possible future requirements.
                (ii) Return to EPA. When Government property is identified as excess, the CO may direct the contractor in writing to return those items to EPA inventory. The contractor shall ship/deliver the property in accordance with the instructions provided by the CO.
                (iii) Transfer. When Government property is identified as excess, the CO may direct the contractor in writing to transfer the property to another EPA contractor. The contractor shall transfer the property by shipping it in accordance with the instructions provided by the CO. To effect transfer of accountability, the contractor shall provide the recipient of the property with the applicable data elements set forth in Attachment 1 of this clause.
                (iv) Sale. If GSA or the DCMA PLCO conducts a sale of the excess Government property, the contractor shall allow prospective bidders access to property offered for sale.
                (v) Abandonment. Abandoned property must be disposed of in a manner that does not endanger the health and safety of the public. If the contract is delegated to DCMA and the contractor has input EPA property into the PCARSS system, the EPA Property Utilization Officer (PUO) shall notify the CO. The CO shall notify the contractor in writing of those items EPA would like to retain, have returned or transferred to another EPA contractor. The contractor shall notify the DCMA PLCO and request withdrawal of those items from the inventory schedule. The contractor shall update the Government property record to indicate the disposition of the item and to close the record. The contractor shall also obtain either a signed receipt or proof of shipment from the recipient. The contractor shall notify the CO when all actions pertaining to disposition have been completed. The contractor shall complete an EPA Property report with changes, to include supporting documentation of completed disposition actions and submit it to the CPC.
                9. Decontamination. In addition to the requirements of the “Government Property” clause and prior to performing disposition of any EPA Government Property, the contractor shall certify in writing that the property is free from contamination by any hazardous or toxic substances.
                10. Contract Closeout. The contractor shall complete a physical inventory of all Government property at contract completion and the results, including any discrepancies, shall be reported to the CO. If the contract is delegated to DCMA, the physical inventory report will be submitted to the EPA CO and a copy submitted to the DCMA PA. In the case of a terminated contract, the contractor shall comply with the inventory requirements set forth in the applicable termination clause. The results of the inventory, as well as a detailed inventory listing, must be forwarded to the CO and if delegated, a copy to the DCMA PA. In order to expedite the disposal process, contractors may be required to, or may elect to submit to the CPC, an inventory schedule for disposal purposes up to six (6) months prior to contract completion. If such an inventory schedule is prepared, the contractor must indicate the earliest date that each item may be disposed. The contractor shall update all property records to show disposal action. The contractor shall notify the CO, and, if delegated, the DCMA PA, in writing, when all work has been completed under the contract and all Government property accountable to the contract has been disposed. The contractor shall complete a FINAL EPA Property report with all supporting documentation to the CPC.
                Attachment 1
                
                  Required Data Element—In addition to the requirements of FAR 52.245-1(f)(vi), Reports of Government Property, the contractor is required to maintain, and report the following data elements for EPA Government property (all elements are not applicable to material): Name and address of the administrative Contracting Officer; Name of the contractor representative; Business type; Name and address of the contract property coordinator; Superfund (Yes/No); No. of Subcontractor/Alternate Locations.
                
                  Note:
                  For items comprising a system which is defined as, “a group of interacting items functioning as a complex whole,” the contractor may maintain the record as a system noting all components of the system under the main component or maintain individual records for each item. However, for the Annual Report of Government Property, the components must be reported as a system with one total dollar amount for the system, if that system total is $25,000 or more.

              1601.101
              Purpose.
              (a) This subpart establishes chapter 16, Office of Personnel Management Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation, within title 48, the Federal Acquisition Regulation System, of the Code of Federal Regulations. The short title of this regulation shall be FEHBAR.
              (b) The purpose of the FEHBAR is to implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) specifically for acquiring and administering contracts with health insurance carriers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
            
            
              1601.102
              Authority.
              (a) The FEHBAR is issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with the authority of 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 and other applicable law and regulation.
              (b) The FEHBAR does not replace or incorporate regulations found at 5 CFR part 890, which provides the substantive policy guidance for administration of the FEHBP under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89. The following is the order of precedence in interpreting a contract provision under the FEHBP:
              (1) 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89;
              (2) 5 CFR part 890;
              (3) 48 CFR Chapters 1 and 16;
              (4) The FEHBP contract.

              1601.103
              Applicability.
              The FAR is generally applicable to contracts negotiated in the FEHBP pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 89. The FEHBAR implements and supplements the FAR where necessary to identify basic and significant acquisition policies unique to the FEHBP.

              1601.104-1
              Publication and code arrangement.
              (a) The FEHBAR and its subsequent changes are published in
              (1) Daily issues of the Federal Register; and
              (2) Cumulative form of the Code of Federal Regulations.
              (b) The FEHBAR is issued as chapter 16 of title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
            
            
              1601.104-2
              Arrangement of regulation.
              (a) General. The FEHBAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by FAR 1.104. However, when a FAR part or subpart is adequate for use without further OPM implementation or supplementation, there will be no corresponding FEHBAR part, subpart, etc. The FEHBAR is to be used in conjunction with the FAR and the order for use is:
              (1) FAR;
              (2) FEHBAR.
              (b) Citation. (1) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, citation of chapter 16 material that has been published in the Federal Register will be to title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

              (2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 16 may be identified as “FEHBAR” followed by the section number.

              Policy.

              (a) Procedures, contract clauses, and other aspects of the acquisition process for contracts in the FEHBP shall be consistent with the principles of the FAR. Changes to the FAR that are otherwise authorized by statute or applicable regulation, dictated by the practical realities associated with the unique nature of health care procurements, or necessary to satisfy specific needs of the Office of Personnel Management shall be implemented as amendments to the FEHBAR and published in the Federal Register, or as deviations to the FAR in accordance with FAR subpart 1.4.

              (b) Internal procedures, instructions, and guides that are necessary to clarify or implement the FEHBAR within OPM may be issued by agency officials specifically designated by the Director, OPM. Normally, such designations will be specified in the OPM Administrative Manual, which is routinely available to agency employees and will be made available to interested outside parties upon request. Clarifying or implementing procedures, instructions, and guides issued pursuant to this section of the FEHBAR must—
              (1) Be consistent with the policies and procedures contained in this regulation as implemented and supplemented from time to time; and
              (2) Follow the format, arrangement, and numbering system of this regulation to the extent practicable.

              Definition of terms.
              In this chapter, unless otherwise indicated, the following terms have the meaning set forth in this subpart.
            
            
              1602.170-1
              Carrier.
              
                Carrier means a voluntary association, corporation, partnership, or other nongovernmental organization which is lawfully engaged in providing, delivering, paying for, or reimbursing the cost of health care services under group insurance policies or contracts, medical or hospital service agreements, membership or subscription contracts, including a health maintenance organization, a nonprofit hospital and health service corporation, or any other entity providing a plan of health insurance, health benefits or health services, in consideration of premiums or other periodic charges payable to the carrier.

              1602.170-2
              Community rate.
              (a) Community rate means a rate of payment based on a per member per month capitation rate or its equivalent that applies to a combination of the subscriber groups for a comprehensive medical plan carrier. References in this subchapter to “a combination of cost and price analysis” relating to the applicability of policy and contract clauses refer to comprehensive medical plan carriers using community rates.
              (b) Adjusted community rate means a community rate which has been adjusted for expected use of medical resources of the FEHBP group. An adjusted community rate is a prospective rate and cannot be retroactively revised to reflect actual experience, utilization, or costs of the FEHBP group, except as described in § 1615.402(c)(4).

              Cost or pricing data.
              (a) Experience-rated carriers. Cost or pricing data for experience-rated carriers includes:
              (1) Information such as claims data;
              (2) Actual or negotiated benefits payments made to providers of medical services for the provision of healthcare, such as capitation not adjusted for specific groups, including mental health benefits capitation rates, per diems, and Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) payments;
              (3) Cost data;
              (4) Utilization data; and
              (5) Administrative expenses and retentions, including capitated administrative expenses and retentions.
              (b) Community rated carriers. Cost or pricing data for community rated carriers is the specialized rating data used by carriers in computing a rate that is appropriate for the Federal group and similarly sized subscriber groups (SSSGs). Such data include, but are not limited to, capitation rates; prescription drug, hospital, and office visit benefits utilization data; trend data; actuarial data; rating methodologies for other groups; standardized presentation of the carrier's rating method (age, sex, etc.) showing that the factor predicts utilization; tiered rates information; “step-up” factors information; demographics such as family size; special benefit loading capitations; and adjustment factors for capitation. After the 2012 plan year, reconciled rates for community rated carriers, other than those required by state law to use Traditional Community Rating (TCR), will be required to meet an FEHB-specific medical loss ratio threshold published annually in OPM's rate instructions to FEHB carriers.

              Similarly sized subscriber groups.
              (a) A Similarly sized subscriber group (SSSG) is a non-FEHB employer group that:
              (1) As of the date specified by OPM in the rate instructions, has a subscriber enrollment closest to the FEHBP subscriber enrollment;
              (2) Uses traditional community rating; and,
              (3) Meets the criteria specified in the rate instructions issued by OPM.
              (b) Any group with which an entity enters into an agreement to provide health care services is a potential SSSG (including groups that are traditional community rated and covered by separate lines of business, government entities, groups that have multi-year contracts, and groups having point-of-service products) except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (1) An entity's subscriber groups may be included as an SSSG if the entity is any of the following:
              (i) The carrier;
              (ii) A division or subsidiary of the carrier;
              (iii) A separate line of business or qualified separate line of business of the carrier; or
              (iv) An entity that maintains a contractual arrangement with the carrier to provide healthcare benefits.
              (2) A subscriber group covered by an entity meeting any of the criteria under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be included for comparison as a SSSG if the entity meets any of the following criteria:
              (i) It reports financial statements on a consolidated basis with the carrier; or
              (ii) Shares, delegates, or otherwise contracts with the carrier, any portion of its workforce that involves the management, design, pricing, or marketing of the healthcare product.
              (c) The following groups must be excluded from SSSG consideration:
              (1) Groups the carrier rates by the method of retrospective experience rating;
              (2) Groups consisting of the carrier's own employees;

              (3) Medicaid groups, Medicare-only groups, and groups that receive only excepted benefits as defined at 26 U.S.C. 9832(c);
              (4) A purchasing alliance whose rate-setting is mandated by the State or local government;
              (5) Administrative Service Organizations (ASOs);
              (6) Any other group excluded from consideration as specified in the rate instructions issued by OPM.
              (d) OPM shall determine the FEHBP rate by selecting the lowest rate derived by using rating methods consistent with those used to derive the SSSG rate.
              (e) In the event that a State-mandated TCR carrier has no SSSG, then it will be subject to the FEHB specific MLR requirement.

              FEHB-specific medical loss ratio threshold calculation.
              (a) Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) means the ratio of plan incurred claims, including the carrier's expenditures for activities that improve health care quality, to total premium revenue determined by OPM, as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services in 45 CFR part 158.
              (b) The FEHB-specific MLR will be calculated on an annual basis. This FEHB-specific MLR will be measured against an FEHB-specific MLR threshold to be put forth by OPM no later than 12 calendar months before the beginning of plan years 2014 and beyond. OPM will publish the FEHB-specific MLR threshold no later than 8 months before the beginning of plan year 2013.
              (c) In place of the credibility adjustment at 45 CFR 158.230-158.232, OPM will set a separate credibility adjustment to account for the special circumstances of small FEHB plans in annual rate instructions to carriers.

              Large Provider Agreement.
              (a) Large Provider Agreement means an agreement between—
              (1) An FEHB carrier, at least 25 percent of which total contracts are FEHB enrollee contracts, and
              (2) A vendor of services or supplies such as mail order pharmacy services, pharmacy benefit management services, mental health and/or substance abuse management services, preferred provider organization services, utilization review services, and/or large case or disease management services. This representative list includes organizations that own or contract with direct providers of healthcare or supplies, or organizations that process claims or manage patient care. A hospital is not considered to be a vendor for purposes of this chapter.
              (i) Where the total costs charged to the FEHB carrier for a contract term for FEHB members, including benefits and services, are reasonably expected to exceed 5 percent of the carrier's total FEHB benefits costs, or
              (ii) Where the total administrative costs charged to the FEHB carrier for the contract term for FEHB members are reasonably expected to exceed 5 percent of the carrier's total FEHB administrative costs (applicable to agreements where the provider is not responsible for FEHB benefits costs).
              (3) As used in this section, the term “carrier” does not include local health plans that serve under an umbrella arrangement with an FEHB carrier.
              (b) The FEHB Program Annual Accounting Statement for the FEHB Plan for the prior contract year will be used to determine the 5 percent threshold under Large Provider Agreements.
              (c) Large Provider Agreements based on cost analysis are subject to the provisions of FAR 52.215-2, “Audit and Records-Negotiation.”

              (d) Large Provider Agreements based on price analysis are subject to the provisions of 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1652.246-70.

              Policy.
              (a) OPM prepares and distributes or makes available to Federal employees and annuitants a comparison booklet which presents summary information and a benefits brochure which details benefits, limitations, and premium rates for all participating plans. OPM does not encourage, support, or reimburse participating carriers for the costs of advertisements. However, while OPM believes that advertising is unnecessary, it recognizes that the decision to use advertising rests with each carrier.
              (b) OPM discourages advertising that is misleading or deceptive. This includes advertising that is directed at other carriers' plans participating in the Program and which uses incomplete or inappropriate comparisons or disparaging or minimizing techniques. Such unfair practices are prejudicial to the interests of the vast majority of carriers whose advertising is fair and accurate.
              (c) Failure to conform to the requirements of this subpart shall be a material breach of the contract and may result in withdrawal of approval to continue participation in the FEHB Program.

              Additional guidelines.
              Any advertisements which identify a carrier's participation in the FEHBP shall—
              (a) Be limited to the merits of the carrier's FEHBP plan and shall be limited to factual statements of the benefits and rates offered by that plan. The official document for benefit and rate comparisons among FEHBP plans is the comparison chart issued by OPM.
              (b) Not use the FEHBP logo.

              (c) Recognize that the officially approved plan brochure is the sole contractual statement of benefits, limitations, and exclusions. All advertisements that in any way discuss plan benefits shall contain the following statement:
              
              
                This is a summary (or brief description) of the features of the (plan's name). Before making a final decision, please read the plan's officially approved brochure, (brochure number). All benefits are subject to the definitions, limitations, and exclusions set forth in the official brochure.
                (d) Set forth the rates for the plan, if the advertisements discuss benefits.
                (e) Not give instructions on enrollment. Statements on enrollment procedures, requirements, or eligibility shall be limited to those such as:
                To sign up, fill out a Health Benefits Registration Form (Standard Form 2809) from your personnel office indicating the enrollment you want:
                The enrollment codes for (plan's name) are:
                
                 Self Only _ Enrollment Code ________
                
                 Self and Family _ Enrollment Code _______
                
                The form must then be returned to your personnel office before the (date) deadline. Your (plan's name) coverage will begin the first pay period in January, (year). If you are a retired Federal employee and need forms, contact the Office of Personnel Management at P.O. Box 809, Washington, DC 20044.

              FEHB Program Large Provider Agreements.
              The following provisions apply to all experience-rated carriers participating in the FEHB Program:
              (a) Notification and information requirements. (1) All experience-rated carriers must provide notice to the contracting officer of their intent to enter into or to make a significant modification to a Large Provider Agreement. Significant modification means a 20% increase or more in the amount of the Large Provider Agreement:
              (i) Not less than 60 days before entering into any Large Provider Agreement; and
              (ii) Not less than 60 days before exercising renewals or other options, or making a significant modification.
              (2) The carrier's notification to the contracting officer must be in writing and must, at a minimum:
              (i) Describe the supplies and/or services the proposed provider agreement will require;
              (ii) Identify the proposed basis for reimbursement;
              (iii) Identify the proposed provider agreement, explain why the carrier selected the proposed provider, and, where applicable, what contracting method it used, including the kind of competition obtained;
              (iv) Describe the methodology the carrier used to compute the provider's profit; and, (v) Describe the provider risk provisions.
              (3) The contracting officer may request from the carrier any additional information on a proposed provider agreement and its terms and conditions prior to a Large Provider award and during the performance of the agreement.
              (4) Within 30 days of receiving the carrier's notification, the contracting officer will either give the carrier written comments or written notice that there will be no comments. If the contracting officer comments, the carrier must respond in writing within 10 calendar days and explain how it intends to address any concerns.
              (5) When computing the carrier's annual service charge, the contracting officer will consider how well the carrier complies with the provisions of this section, including the advance notification requirements, as an aspect of the carrier's performance factor.
              (6) The contracting officer's review of any Large Provider agreement, option, renewal, or modification will not constitute a determination of the acceptability of terms or conditions of any provider agreement or the allowability of any costs under the carrier's contract, nor will it relieve the carrier of any responsibility for performing the contract.
              (b) Records and inspection. The carrier must insert in all Large Provider Agreements the requirement that the provider will retain and make available to the Government all records relating to the agreement as follows:
              (1) Records that support the annual statement of operations—Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.
              (2) Enrollee records, if applicable—Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.
              (c) Large Provider Agreements based on cost analysis are subject to the provisions of FAR 52.215-2, “Audit and Records-Negotiation.”
              (d) Large Provider Agreements based on price analysis are subject to the provisions of 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1652.246-70.

This change reflects the FEHBP's statutory exemption from competitive bidding (5 U.S.C. 8902), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.

Current carriers must submit the certification once, along with their benefit and rate proposals for the 1995 contract year.
              
                Debarment, Suspension, Proposed Debarment, and Other Responsibility Matters
                The Carrier certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that—
                (a) The Carrier and/or any of its Principals—
                (1) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
                (2) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a 3-year period preceding this certification, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property; and
                (3) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(2) of this clause.

                (4) The Carrier has ( ) has not ( ), within a 3-year period preceding this certification, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
                
                (b) Principals, for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions).
                This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may render the Carrier subject to prosecution under section 1001, title 18, United States Code.
                (c) The Carrier shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time, the Carrier learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
                (d) A Carrier's certification that any of the actions mentioned in the certification exists will not necessarily result in termination of the contract. However, the certification, or the Carrier's failure to provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer, will be considered in connection with a determination of the Carrier's responsibility under subpart 1609.70, Minimum Standards for Health Benefits Carriers.
                (e) Nothing contained in the certification shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by this section. The knowledge and information of the Carrier is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

                (f) The certification in this section is a material representation of fact upon which reliance is placed by the Contracting Officer. If it is later determined that the Carrier knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract for default.
                
                Carrier Name:
                
                
                Name of Chief Executive Officer
                
                Date signed:
              
              (End of certificate)
            
          
          
            Subpart 1609.70—Minimum Standards for Health Benefits Carriers
            
              1609.7001
              Minimum standards for health benefits carriers.
              (a) The carrier of an approved health benefits plan shall meet the requirements of chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code; part 890 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations; chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations, and the following standards. The carrier shall continue to meet the requirements of chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, and the standards cited in this paragraph while under contract with OPM. Failure to meet these requirements and standards is cause for OPM's withdrawal of approval of the health benefits carrier and termination of the contract in accordance with 5 CFR 890.204.
              (1) It must be lawfully engaged in the business of supplying health benefits.
              (2) It must have, in the judgement of OPM, the financial resources and experience in the field of health benefits to carry out its obligations under the plan.
              (3) It must keep such reasonable financial and statistical records, and furnish such reasonable financial and statistical reports with respect to the plan, as may be requested by OPM.
              (4) It must permit representatives of OPM and of the General Accounting Office to audit and examine its records and accounts which pertain, directly or indirectly, to the plan at such reasonable times and places as may be designated by OPM or the General Accounting Office.
              (5) It must accept, subject to adjustment for error or fraud, in payment of its charges for health benefits for all enrollees in its plan, the enrollment charges received by the Employees Health Benefits (EHB) Fund less amounts set aside for the administrative and contingency reserves prescribed in 5 CFR 890.503. OPM makes available or pays the amounts within 30 days of receipt by the EHB Fund.
              (6) A carrier that is an employee organization must continue coverage, without requirement of membership, of any eligible survivor annuitants, former spouses continuing coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.803, children temporarily continuing coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.1103(a)(2), or former spouses temporarily continuing coverage with the carrier under 5 CFR 890.1103(a)(3).

              (7) It must timely submit to OPM a properly completed and signed novation or change-of-name agreement in accordance with subpart 1642.12 of this chapter.
              (b) In addition to the standards in paragraph (a) of this section, the carrier must perform the contract in accordance with prudent business practices. A carrier's sustained poor business practice in the management or administration of a health benefits plan is cause for OPM's withdrawal of approval of the health benefits carrier and termination of the carrier's contract. Prudent business practices include, but are not limited to, the following:
              (1) Timely compliance with OPM instructions and directives.
              (2) Legal and ethical business and health care practices.
              (3) Compliance with the terms of the FEHB contract, regulations and statutes.
              (4) Timely and accurate adjudication of claims or rendering of medical services.
              (5) A system for accounting for costs incurred under the contract, when required, which includes segregating and pricing FEHB medical utilization and allocating indirect and administrative costs in a reasonable and equitable manner.
              (6) Accurate accounting reports of actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs incurred in the administration of the contract.
              (7) Application of performance standards for assuring contract quality as required by 1646.270(d).
              (8) Establishment and maintenance of a system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance that:
              (i) The provision and payments of benefits and other expenses are in compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual guidelines;
              (ii) FEHB funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and,
              (iii) Data are accurately and fairly disclosed in all reports required by OPM.
              (c) The following types of activities are examples of poor business practices which adversely affect the health benefits carrier's responsibility under its contract. A pattern of poor conduct or evidence of misconduct in these areas is cause for OPM to withdraw approval of the carrier:
              (1) Presenting false claims by charging expenses to the contract which according to the contract terms are not chargeable to the contract;
              (2) Using fraudulent or unethical business or health care practices or otherwise displaying a lack of business integrity or honesty;
              (3) Repeatedly and knowingly providing false or misleading information in the rate setting process;
              (4) Repeated failure to comply with OPM instructions and directives;
              (5) Having an accounting system that is incapable of separately accounting for costs incurred under the contract and/or that lacks the internal controls necessary to fulfill the terms of the contract; and
              (6) Failure to assure that the plan provides properly paid or denied claims, or providing medical services which are inconsistent with standards of good medical practice.
              (7) Entering into contracts or employment agreements with providers, provider groups, or health care workers that include provisions or financial incentives that directly or indirectly create an inducement to limit or restrict communication about medically necessary services to any individual covered under the FEHB Program. Financial incentives are defined as bonuses, withholds, commissions, profit sharing or other similar adjustments to basic compensation (e.g., service fee, capitation, salary) which have the effect of limiting or reducing communication about appropriate medically necessary services. Providers, health care workers, or health plan sponsoring organizations are not required to discuss treatment options that they would not ordinarily discuss in their customary course of practice because such options are inconsistent with their professional judgment or ethical, moral or religious beliefs.

              (d) The Director or his or her designee will determine whether to propose withdrawal of approval and hold a hearing based on the seriousness of the carrier's actions and its proposed method to effect corrective action.

              1615.402
              Pricing policy.
              Pricing of FEHB contracts is governed by 5 U.S.C. 8902(i), 5 U.S.C. 8906, and other applicable law. FAR subpart 15.4 will be implemented by applying its policies and procedures—to the extent practicable—as follows:
              (a) For both experience-rated and community-rated contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be less than the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will not require the carrier to provide cost or pricing data in the rate proposal for the following contract term.
              (b) Cost analysis will be used for contracts where premiums and subscription income are determined on the basis of experience rating.
              (c)(1) A combination of cost and price analysis will be used for contracts where premiums and subscription income are based on community-rates. For contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be less than the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will not require the carrier to provide cost or pricing data. The carrier is required to submit only a rate proposal and abbreviated utilization data for the applicable contract year. OPM will evaluate the proposed rates by performing a basic reasonableness test on the information submitted. Rates failing this test will be subject to further review.
              (2) For contracts with fewer than 1,500 enrollee contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be at or above the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will require the carrier to submit its rate proposal, utilization data, and a certificate of accurate cost or pricing data required in 1615.406-2. In addition, OPM will require the carrier to complete the proposed rates form containing cost and pricing data, and the Community-Rate Questionnaire, but will not require the carrier to send these documents to OPM. The carrier will keep the documents on file for periodic auditor and actuarial review in accordance with 1652.204-70. OPM will perform a basic reasonableness test on the data submitted. Rates that do not pass this test will be subject to further OPM review.
              (3) For plan year 2012, plans will have the option of continuing to use the similarly sized subscriber group (SSSG) rating methodology described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section or using the MLR rating methodology described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. All non-traditional community rated (TCR) plans will be required to submit FEHB-specific MLR information for every year beginning with plan year 2011.
              (i) Similarly sized subscriber group (SSSG) methodology. (A) For contracts with 1,500 or more enrollee contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be at or above the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will require the carrier to provide the data and methodology used to determine the FEHB Program rates. OPM will also require the data and methodology used to determine the rates for the carrier's SSSG. The carrier will provide cost or pricing data required by OPM in its rate instructions for the applicable contract period. OPM will evaluate the data to ensure that the rate is reasonable and consistent with the requirements in this chapter. If necessary, OPM may require the carrier to provide additional documentation.
              (B) Contracts will be subject to a downward price adjustment if OPM determines that the Federal group was charged more than it would have been charged using a methodology consistent with that used for the SSSG. Such adjustments will be based on the rate determined by using the methodology (including discounts) the carrier used for the SSSG.
              (C) FEHB Program community-rated carriers will comply with SSSG criteria provided by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable contract period.
              (ii) FEHB-specific medical loss ratio (MLR) threshold methodology. (A) For contracts with 1,500 or more enrollee contracts for which the FEHB Program premiums for the contract term will be at or above the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), OPM will require the carrier to provide the data and methodology used to determine the FEHB Program rates. OPM will also require the data and methodology used to determine the medical loss ratio (MLR) as defined in the ACA (Pub. L. 111-148) and as defined by HHS in 45 CFR part 158 for all FEHB community rated plans other than those required by state law to use Traditional Community Rating. The carrier will provide cost or pricing data, as well as the FEHB-specific MLR threshold data required by OPM in its rate instructions for the applicable contract period. OPM will evaluate the data to ensure that the rate is reasonable and consistent with the requirements in this chapter. If necessary, OPM may require the carrier to provide additional documentation.
              (B) Contracts will be subject to a subsidization penalty if OPM determines that the FEHB group did not meet the FEHB-specific MLR threshold specified in the annual rate instruction to carriers. Such a subsidization penalty will be deposited into a Subsidization Penalty Account held at the U.S. Treasury. This Subsidization Penalty Account will be held in common with all community rated carriers and will be annually distributed to the contingency reserve accounts of all non-TCR community rated plans on a pro-rata basis.
              (C) FEHB Program community-rated carriers will comply with the MLR criteria, including the FEHB-specific MLR threshold provided by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable contract period. FEHB plans that are required by state law to use TCR are exempt from this requirement and will use the SSSG methodology outlined in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
              (4) Contracts will be subject to a downward price adjustment if OPM determines that the Federal group was charged more than it would have been charged using a methodology consistent with that used for the similarly-sized subscriber group (SSSG). Such adjustments will be based on the rate determined by using the methodology (including discounts) the carrier used for the SSSG.
              (5) FEHB Program community-rated carriers will comply with SSSG criteria provided by OPM in the rate instructions for the applicable contract period.
              (d) The application of FAR 15.402(b)(2) should not be construed to prohibit the consideration of preceding year surpluses or deficits in carrier-held reserves in the rate adjustments for subsequent year renewals of contracts based, in whole or in part, on cost analysis.

              Profit.
              (a) When the pricing of FEHB Program contracts is determined by cost analysis (experience-rated) or by a combination of cost and price analysis (community rated), OPM will determine a performance based percentage of the price using a weighted guidelines structured approach based on the profit analysis factors described in 1615.404-70. For experience-rated plans, OPM will use the performance based percentage so determined to develop the profit or fee prenegotiation objective, which will be the total profit (service charge) negotiated for the contract. For community-rated plans, OPM will use the performance based percentage so determined to develop an adjustment to net-to-carrier premiums, (performance adjustment) to be made during the first quarter of the following contract period.
              (b) OPM will not guarantee a minimum service charge.

              Profit analysis factors.

              (a) OPM Contracting Officers will apply a weighted guidelines method in developing the performance based percentage for FEHB Program contracts. For experience-rated plans, the performance based percentage will be applied to projected incurred claims and allowable administrative expenses. For community-rated plans, the performance based percentage will be applied to subscription income and will be used to calculate a performance adjustment to net-to-carrier premiums, as described at 48 CFR 1632.170(a)(2), to be made during the first quarter of the following contract period. In the context of the factors outlined in FAR 15.404- 4(d), OPM will assess performance of FEHB carriers according to four factors.
              (1) Clinical quality. OPM will consider elements within such domains as preventive care, chronic disease management, medication use, and behavioral health. This factor incorporates elements from the FAR factor “contractor effort.”
              (2) Customer service. OPM will consider elements within such domains as communication, access, claims, and member experience/engagement. This factor incorporates elements of the FAR factor “contractor effort.”

              Certificates of accurate cost or pricing data for community rated carriers.
              (a) The contracting officer will require a carrier with a contract meeting the requirements in 1615.402(c)(2) or (3) to execute one or more of the Certificates contained in this section. A carrier with a contract meeting the requirements in 1615.402(c)(2) will complete the appropriate Certificate(s) and keep such on file at the carrier's place of business in accordance with 1652.204-70. A carrier with a contract meeting the requirements in 1615.402(c)(3) will complete and submit the appropriate certificate(s) to OPM.
              (b) A carrier using the SSSG methodology described in 1615.402(c)(3)(i) will submit the “Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community-Rated Carriers (SSSG methodology)” along with its rate reconciliation during the first quarter of the applicable contract year. A carrier using the MLR methodology described in 1615.402(c)(3)(ii) will submit two forms. The “Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community-Rated Carriers (MLR methodology)” will be submitted along with the rate reconciliation during the first quarter of the applicable contract year. The “Certificate of Accurate MLR Calculation” will be submitted when the carrier submits its FEHB-specific MLR calculation to OPM.

              1631.203-70
              Allocation techniques.
              (a) Carriers shall use the following methods for allocating groupings of business unit indirect costs. Carriers shall consistently apply the methods and techniques established to classify direct and indirect costs, to group indirect costs and to allocate indirect costs to cost objectives.
              (1) Input method. The preferred allocation technique is one that shows the consumption of resources in performance of the activities (input) for the function(s) represented by the cost grouping. This allocation technique should be used in circumstances where there is a direct and definitive relationship between the function(s) and the benefiting cost objectives. Measures of input ordinarily may be expressed in terms such as labor hours or square footage. This means costs may be allocated by use of a rate, such as a rate per labor hour or cost per square foot.
              (2) Output method. Where input measures are unavailable or impractical to determine, the basis for allocation may be a measure of the output of the function(s) represented by the cost grouping. The output becomes a substitute measure for the use of resources and is a reasonable alternative when a direct measure of input is impractical. Output may be measured in terms of units of end product produced by the function(s). Examples of output measures include number of claims processed by a claims processing center, number of pages printed in a print shop, number of purchase orders processed by a purchasing department, or number of hires by a personnel office.
              (3) Surrogate method. Where neither activity (input) nor output of the function(s) can be measured practically, a surrogate must be used to measure the resources utilized. Surrogates used to represent the relationship generally measure the benefit to the cost objectives receiving the service and should vary in proportion to the services received. For example, if a personnel department provides various services that cannot be measured practically on an activity (input) or output basis, number of personnel served might reasonably represent the use of resources of the personnel function for the cost objectives receiving the service, where this base varies in proportion to the services performed.
              (4) Other method. Some cost groupings cannot readily be allocated on measures of specific beneficial or causal relationships under paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section. Such costs do not have a direct and definitive relationship to the benefiting cost objectives. Generally, the cost of overall management activities falls in this category. Overall management costs should be grouped in relation to the activities managed. The base selected to measure the allocation of these indirect costs to cost objectives should be a base representative of the entire activity being managed. For example, the total operating expenses of activities managed might be a reasonable base for allocating the general indirect costs of a business unit. Another reasonable method for allocating general indirect costs might be to base them on a percentage of contracts. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather are examples of allocation methods that may be acceptable under individual circumstances. See also General and Administrative (G&A) expenses, FEHBAR 1631.203-71.
              (b) Carriers that use multiple cost centers to accumulate and allocate costs shall apply the techniques in paragraph (a) of this section at each step of the allocation process. Accordingly, the allocation of costs among cost centers at the initial entry into the cost accounting system shall be made in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Likewise, the allocation of the cost of interim cost centers to final cost centers is subject to paragraph (a) of this section. If costs of final cost centers are allocated among final cost objectives, the allocation shall also be made in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. It is possible that carriers using multiple cost centers to accumulate and allocate costs may not have any direct costs, i.e., costs identified specifically with a final cost objective.

              (c) The allocation of business unit general and administrative expenses and the allocation of home office expenses to segments are also subject to FEHBAR 1631.203-71 and FEHBAR 1631.203-72, respectively.

              A carrier's practices for allocating home office expenses to the segments of the carrier will be acceptable for purposes of FAR 31.203 if they are allocated on the basis of the beneficial or causal relationship between the home office activities and the segments to which the expenses are allocated. Expenses that cannot be allocated on the basis of a more specific beneficial or causal relationship should be allocated on a basis representative of the entire activity being managed. The compliance of such allocations with FAR 31.203 shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each situation.

              Taxes.
              5 U.S.C. 8909(f)(1) prohibits the imposition of taxes, fees, or other monetary payment, directly or indirectly, on FEHB premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of those entities. Therefore, FAR 31.205-41 is modified to include those taxes as unallowable costs. The prohibited payments, referred to elsewhere in these regulations as “premium taxes,” applies to all payments directed by States or municipalities, regardless of how they may be titled, to whom they must be paid, or the purpose for which they are collected, and it applies to all forms of direct and indirect measurements on FEHBP premiums, however modified, to include cost per contract or enrollee, with the sole exception of a tax on net income or profit, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.

              FEHBP public relations and advertising costs.
              (a) The cost of media messages that are directed at advising current FEHBP subscribers on how to obtain benefits shall be an allowable expense within the meaning of FAR 31.205-1 because this service is directly related to performance of the FEHBP contract. If there is any question about the allowability of such a cost, the carrier may request advance approval regarding the content and cost of the message.
              (b) Costs of media messages not provided for in paragraph (a) of this section are allowable if the content is specifically approved by the contracting officer and all of the following criteria are met:
              (1) The primary effect of the message is to disseminate information on health care cost containment or preventive health care;
              (2) The costs of the carrier's messages are allocated to all underwritten and non-underwritten lines of business; and
              (3) The contracting officer approves the total dollar amount of the carrier's messages to be charged to the FEHBP in advance of the contract year.
              (c) Costs of messages that are intended to, or which have the primary effect of, calling favorable attention to the carrier (or subcontractor) for the purpose of enhancing its overall image or selling its health plan are not allowable.

              (b)(1) The costs of compensated personal absence shall be assigned to the cost accounting period or periods in which entitlement was earned. Entitlement means an employee's right, whether conditional or unconditional, to receive a determinable amount of compensated personal absence, or pay in lieu thereof.
              (2) If at the beginning of the 1st year a carrier subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section has a liability for accrued but unpaid expenses for compensated personal absences that would otherwise be allocable to FEHB contracts, the carrier may include such costs in a suspense account. The suspense account may be amortized and included in government contract costs at a rate not exceeding 20 percent per year.

              FEHBP interest expense.
              (a) Interest charges incurred in the administration of FEHBP contracts are not allowable in accordance with FAR 31.205-20. However, interest charges that are associated with the carrier's investment of FEHBP account funds are not considered administrative costs and may be allowable under very limited circumstances if all of the following criteria are met:
              (1) Borrowing is limited to the positive balance of the carrier's entire FEHBP investment portfolio;
              (2) FEHBP funds are tied up in long-term securities;
              (3) Liquidation of long-term securities would cost more than the cost of the interest;
              (4) The interest rates charged are at or below current market rates; and
              (5) Advance written approval of the contracting officer is obtained before such costs are incurred.
              (b) The carrier must demonstrate on a case-by-case basis that borrowing rather than cashing in long-term investments shall actually result in cost savings to the FEHB Program. Satisfactory demonstration of cost savings is a prerequisite to contracting officer approval of the interest cost as a charge to the contract.
              (c) If the interest charge is allowed, the risk factor in the service charge will be adjusted downward so that the carrier does not recover interest costs through both the service charge and an allowance under this paragraph.

              (b) Selling costs are allowable costs to FEHBP contracts to the extent that they are necessary for conducting annual contract negotiations with the Government and for liaison activities necessary for ongoing contract administration. Personnel and related travel costs are allowable for attendance at Open Season Health fairs and other similar activities at which carriers give enrollees information about their choices among health plans (but see FAR 31.205-1 ‘Public relations and advertising costs’, and The Federal Employees Health Benefits Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices, Subchapter S2-3(f) ‘Controlling contacts between employees and carriers’).

              Trade, business, technical, and professional activity costs.
              (a) FEHBP participating plans, carriers, and underwriters shall seek the advance written approval of the contracting officer for allowability of all or part of the costs associated with trade, business, technical, and professional activities (FAR 31.205-43) when the allocable costs of such participation to the FEHBP will exceed $1,000 annually and when the carrier or underwriter allocates more than 50% of the membership cost of a trade, business, technical, or professional organization to the FEHBP.
              (b) When approval of costs for membership in an organization is required, the carrier or underwriter must demonstrate conclusively that membership in such an organization and participation in its activities extend beyond the contractual relationship with OPM, have a reasonable relationship to providing care and services to FEHBP enrollees, and that the organization is not engaged in activities such as those cited in FAR 31.205-22 (lobbying costs) for which costs are not allowable.

              Charges for mandatory statutory reserves are not allowed unless provided for in the contract. When the term “mandatory statutory reserve” is specifically identified as an allowable contract charge without further definition or explanation, it means a requirement imposed by State law upon the carrier to set aside a specific amount or rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is accounted for separately from all other reserves and surpluses of the carrier and which may be used only with the specific approval of the State official designated by law to make such approvals. The amount chargeable to the contract may not exceed an allocable portion of the amount actually set aside. If the statutory reserve is no longer required for the purpose for which it was created, and these funds become available for the general use of the carrier, a pro rata share based upon FEHBP's contribution to the total carrier's set aside shall be returned to the FEHBP in accordance with FAR 31.201-5.

Amounts which exceed allowable costs may be paid to a major subcontractor only from the service charge negotiated between OPM and the Carrier.

              Recurring premium payments to carriers.
              (a)(1) Recurring payments to carriers of community-rated plans. OPM will pay to carriers of community-rated plans the premium payments received for the plan less the amounts credited to the contingency and administrative reserves, amounts assessed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and amounts due for other contractual obligations. Premium payments will be due and payable not later than 30 days after receipt by the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Fund.
              (2) The difference between one percent and the performance based percentage of the contract price described at 1615.404-4 will be multiplied by the carrier's subscription income for the year of performance and the resulting amount (performance adjustment) will be withheld from the net-to-carrier premium disbursement during the first quarter of the following contract period unless an alternative payment arrangement is made with the carrier's Contracting Officer. Amounts withheld from a community rated plan's premium disbursement will be deposited into the plan's Contingency Reserve.
              (3) Any subsidization penalty levied against a community rated plan as outlined in 48 CFR 1615.402(c)(3)(ii)(B) must be paid within 60 days from notification. If payment is not received within the 60 day period, OPM will withhold from the community rated carriers the periodic premium payment payable until fully recovered. OPM will deposit the withheld funds in the subsidization penalty reserve described in 5 CFR 890.503(c)(6).
              (b)(1) Recurring payments to carriers of experience-rated plans. OPM will make payments on a letter of credit (LOC) basis. Premium payments received for the plan, less the amounts credited to the contingency and administrative reserves and amounts for other obligations due under the contract, will be made available for carrier drawdown not later than 30 days after receipt by the FEHB Fund.
              (2) Withdrawals from the LOC account will be made on a checks-presented basis. Under a checks-presented basis, drawdown on the LOC is delayed until the checks issued for FEHB Program disbursements are presented to the carrier's bank for payment.
              (3) OPM may grant a waiver of the restriction of LOC disbursements to a checks-presented basis if the carrier requests the waiver in writing and demonstrates to OPM's satisfaction that the checks-presented basis of LOC disbursements will result in significantly increased liability under the contract, or that the checks-presented basis of LOC disbursements is otherwise clearly and significantly detrimental to the operation of the plan. Payments to carriers that have been granted a waiver may be made by an alternative payment methodology, subject to OPM approval.

OPM will decide whether to allow the request in whole or in part and will advise the carrier of its decision. However, OPM shall not unreasonably withhold approval for amounts requested that exceed the plan's preferred minimum balance for the contingency reserve.

              (b) Carrier or underwriter commingling of FEHBP funds with those from other sources makes it difficult to precisely determine FEHBP cash balances at any given time or to precisely determine investment income attributable to FEHBP invested assets.
              (c) FEHBP funds shall be maintained separately from other cash and investments of the carrier or underwriter. Cash and investment balances reported on FEHBP Annual Accounting Statements must agree with the carrier's books and records.
              (d) This requirement may be waived by the contracting officer in accordance with the clause at 1652.232-72 when adequate accounting and other controls are in effect. If the requirement is waived, the waiver will remain in effect until it is withdrawn by OPM. The waiver shall be withdrawn if OPM determines that the accounting controls are no longer adequate to properly account for FEHBP funds.

The contracting officer shall insert the following agreement in all FEHBP contracts for use when the contractor's assets or the entire portion of the assets pertinent to the performance of the contract, as determined by the Government, are transferred.
              
                Novation Agreement
                The (insert corporate name) (Transferor), a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of (insert State) with its principal office in (insert city, state); the (insert corporate name) (Transferee), (if appropriate add “formerly known as the ______________ Corporation”) a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of (insert State) with its principal office in (insert city); and the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (Government) enter into this Agreement effective (insert date transfer of assets became effective under applicable State law).
                (a) THE PARTIES AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTS:

                (1) The Government, represented by various Contracting Officers of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), has entered into Contract Number __ with the Transferor. The term contracts, as used in this Agreement, means the contract cited in this paragraph and all other contracts and purchase orders, including any and all amendments and modifications made between the Government and the Transferor before the effective date of this Agreement (whether or not performance and payment have been completed and releases executed if the Government or the Transferor has any remaining rights, duties, or obligations under these contracts and purchase orders).

                (2) As of _____________ 19__ (insert date transfer of assets became effective under applicable State law), the Transferor has transferred to the Transferee all the assets of the Transferor, or the entire portion of the Transferor's assets pertinent to performing the contract, as determined by OPM, by virtue of a(an) (insert term describing the legal transaction involved) between the Transferor and the Transferee.
                (3) The Transferee has acquired all the assets of the Transferor, or the entire portion of the Transferor's assets pertinent to performing the contract, as determined by OPM, by virtue of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1).
                (4) The Transferee has assumed all obligations and liabilities of the Transferor pertinent to performing the contract, as determined by OPM, by virtue of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1).
                (5) The Transferee is in a position to fully perform all obligations that may exist under the contract.
                (6) It is consistent with the Government's interest to recognize the Transferee as the successor party to the contract.
                (7) Evidence of the transfer in paragraph (a)(1) has been filed with the Government.

                (8) [If applicable:] A certificate dated ____________, 19__, signed by the Secretary of State of (insert State), to the effect that the corporate name of (insert old corporate name) was changed to (insert new corporate name) on ___________, 19__, has been filed with the Government.
                (b) IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTS, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT BY THIS AGREEMENT—

                (1) The Transferor confirms the transfer to the Transferee, and waives any claims and rights against the Government or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund that it now has or may have in the future in connection with the contract.
                
                (2) The Transferee agrees to be bound by and to perform the contract in accordance with the conditions contained in the contract. The Transferee also assumes all obligations and liabilities of, and all claims against, the Transferor pertinent to the contract, as determined by OPM, as if the Transferee were the original party to the contract.
                (3) The Transferee ratifies all previous actions taken by the Transferor with respect to the contract, with the same force and effect as if the action had been taken by the Transferee.

                (4) The Government recognizes the Transferee as the Transferor's successor in interest in and to the contract. The Transferee by this Agreement becomes entitled to all rights, titles, and interests of the Transferor in and to the contract as if the Transferee were the original party to the contract. Following the effective date of this Agreement, the terms Carrier and Contractor as used in the contract, shall refer to the Transferee.
                (5) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in it shall be construed as a waiver of any rights of the Government against the Transferor.
                (6) All payments and reimbursements previously made by the Government to the Transferor, and all other previous actions taken by the Government under the contract, shall be considered to have discharged those parts of the Government's obligations under the contract. All payments and reimbursements made by the Government after the date of this Agreement in the name of or to the Transferor shall have the same force and effect as if made to the Transferee, and shall constitute a complete discharge of the Government's obligations under the contract, to the extent of the amounts paid or reimbursed.
                (7) The Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related increases, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from the transfer of this Agreement, other than those that the Government in the absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been obligated to pay or reimburse under the terms of the contract.
                (8) The Transferor guarantees payment of all liabilities and the performance of all obligations that the Transferee (i) assumes under this Agreement or (ii) may undertake in the future should this contract be modified under its terms and conditions. The Transferor waives notice of, and consents to, any such future modifications.

                (9) The contract shall remain in full force and effect, except as modified by this Agreement. Each party has executed this Agreement effective (insert the date transfer of assets became effective under applicable State law).

              1642.7001
              Management agreement.

              When it is in the best interest of FEHBP enrollees to continue a contract for an interim period after the carrier discontinues its operations and has entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (or other descriptive term), but before a successor in interest has been recognized by OPM, the carrier may submit for OPM approval a Management Agreement that enables it to continue a contract through an agreement with a third party to administer the day-to-day performance of the contract. Examples of situations in which a Management Agreement may be accepted by OPM are:
              
              (a) When a transfer of assets does not meet the criteria for a novation;
              (b) While a request for a novation is pending;
              (c) While awaiting a decision on a request for a novation;
              (d) As an interim measure, when the timing of a transfer of assets or the timing of a carrier's withdrawal make administration of the contract inconvenient;
              (e) When it is not in the interests of the Government to either recognize a successor in interest or to immediately terminate the existing FEHBP contract.

              1644.170
              Policy for FEHB Program subcontracting.
              (a) General policy. Carriers must follow commercially reasonable procurement procedures that comply, when required, with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) policies and procedures relating to competition and contract pricing for the acquisition of both commercial and noncommercial items.
              (b) Consent. For all experience-rated contracts, carriers will notify the Contracting officer in writing at least 30 days in advance of entering into any subcontract or subcontract modification, or as otherwise specified by the contract, if: the amount of the subcontract or the amount of the subcontract and modification charged to the FEHB Program equals or exceeds $550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total subcontract's costs. The amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB Program shall be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 254b(a)(7). Failure to provide advance notice may result in a Contracting officer's disallowance of subcontract costs or a penalty when considering the performance aspect of the carriers' service charge.
              (1) All subcontracts or subcontract modifications that equal or exceed the threshold are subject to audit under FAR 52.215-2 “Audit and Records-Negotiations” if based on cost analysis, and subject to the provisions of 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1652.246-70 “FEHB Inspection” if based on price analysis.
              (2) In determining whether the amount chargeable to the FEHB Program contract for a given subcontract or modification equals or exceeds the $550,000 threshold, the following rules apply:
              (i) For initial advance notification, the carrier shall provide the total cost/price for the base year.
              (ii) The carrier shall provide advance notification of any modifications, options, including quantity or service options and option periods, and renewals of “evergreen contracts” that cause the total price to equal or exceed the threshold. OPM's review will be of the modification(s), itself, but documentation for the original subcontract will be required to perform the review.

              (iii) The $550,000 threshold will be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act.

              Contract Quality Policy.
              (a) This section prescribes general policies and procedures to ensure that services acquired under the FEHB contract conform to the contract's quality and audit requirements.
              (b) OPM will periodically evaluate the contractor's system of internal controls under the quality assurance program required by the contract and will acknowledge in writing whether or not the system is consistent with the requirements set forth in the contract. After the initial review, subsequent reviews may be limited to changes in the contractor's internal control guidelines. However, a limited review does not diminish the contractor's obligation to apply the full internal control system.
              (c) OPM will issue specific quality performance standards for the FEHB contracts and will inform carriers of the applicable standards prior to negotiations for the contract year. OPM will benchmark its standards against standards generally accepted in the insurance industry. The contracting officer may authorize nationally recognized standards to be used to fulfill this requirement. FEHB carriers will comply with the performance standards issued by OPM.
              (d) In addition to reviewing carriers' quality assurance programs, OPM will periodically audit contractors, subcontractors and Large Providers' books and records to assure compliance with FEHB law, regulations, and the contract.

                (b) Criteria to assess compliance with paragraph (a) of this clause are available in the FEHB Supplemental Literature Guidelines which are developed by OPM and should be used, along with the additional guidelines set forth in FEHBAR 1603.702, as the primary guide in preparing material; further guidance is provided in the NAIC “Rules Governing Advertising of Accident and Sickness Insurance With Interpretive Guidelines.” Guidelines are periodically updated and provided to the Carrier by OPM.

Corrective action will be appropriate to the circumstances and may include, but is not limited to the following actions by OPM:
                (1) Directing the Carrier to cease and desist distribution, publication, or broadcast of the material;

                (d) Egregious or repeated offenses may result in the following action by OPM:
                (1) Suspending new enrollments in the Carrier's Plan(s);
                (2) Providing Enrollees an opportunity to transfer to another plan; and
                (3) Terminating the contract in accordance with Section 1.15, Renewal and Withdrawal of Approval.
                (e) Prior to taking action as described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause, the OPM will notify the Carrier and offer an opportunity to respond.
                (f) The Carrier shall incorporate this clause in subcontracts with its underwriter, if any, and other subcontractors directly involved in the preparation or distribution of such advertising material and shall substitute “Contractor” or other appropriate reference for the term “Carrier.”

                Coordination of Benefits (JAN 1991)
                (a) The Carrier shall coordinate the payment of benefits under this contract with the payment of benefits under Medicare, other group health benefits coverages, and the payment of medical and hospital costs under no-fault or other automobile insurance that pays benefits without regard to fault.
                (b) The Carrier shall not pay benefits under this contract until it has determined whether it is the primary carrier or unless permitted to do so by the Contracting Officer.
                (c) In coordinating benefits between plans, the Carrier shall follow the order of precedence established by the NAIC Model Guidelines for Coordination of Benefits (COB) as specified by OPM.
                (d) Where (1) the Carrier makes payments under this contract which are subject to COB provisions; (2) the payments are erroneous, not in accordance with the terms of the contract, or in excess of the limitations applicable under this contract; and (3) the Carrier is unable to recover such COB overpayments from the Member or the providers of services or supplies, the Contracting Officer may allow such amounts to be charged to the contract; the Carrier must be prepared to demonstrate that it has made a diligent effort to recover such COB overpayments.
                (e) COB savings shall be reported by experience rated carriers each year along with the Carrier's annual accounting statement in a form specified by OPM.
                (f) Changes in the order of precedence established by the NAIC Model Guidelines implemented after January 1 of any given year shall be required no earlier than the beginning of the following contract term.

                (a) General. (1) The Carrier resolves claims filed under the Plan. All health benefit claims must be submitted initially to the Carrier. If the Carrier denies a claim (or a portion of a claim), the covered individual may ask the Carrier to reconsider its denial. If the Carrier affirms its denial or fails to respond as required by paragraph (b) of this clause, the covered individual may ask OPM to review the claim. A covered individual must exhaust both the Carrier and OPM review processes specified in this clause before seeking judicial review of the denied claim.
                (2) This clause applies to covered individuals and to other individuals or entities who are acting on the behalf of a covered individual and who have the covered individual's specific written consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim.
                (b) Time limits for reconsidering a claim. (1) The covered individual has 6 months from the date of the notice to the covered individual that a claim (or a portion of a claim) was denied by the Carrier in which to submit a written request for reconsideration to the Carrier. The time limit for requesting reconsideration may be extended when the covered individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.
                (2) The Carrier has 30 days after the date of receipt of a timely-filed request for reconsideration to:
                (i) Affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual;
                (ii) Pay the bill or provide the service; or
                (iii) Request from the covered individual or provider additional information needed to make a decision on the claim. The Carrier must simultaneously notify the covered individual of the information requested if it requests additional information from a provider. The Carrier has 30 days after the date the information is received to affirm the denial in writing to the covered individual or pay the bill or provide the service. The Carrier must make its decision based on the evidence it has if the covered individual or provider does not respond within 60 days after the date of the Carrier's notice requesting additional information. The Carrier must then send written notice to the covered individual of its decision on the claim. The covered individual may request OPM review as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause if the Carrier fails to act within the time limit set forth in this paragraph.
                (3) The covered individual may write to OPM and request that OPM review the Carrier's decision if the Carrier either affirms its denial of a claim or fails to respond to a covered individual's written request for reconsideration within the time limit set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause. The covered individual must submit the request for OPM review within the time limit specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause.
                (4) The Carrier may extend the time limit for a covered individual's submission of additional information to the Carrier when the covered individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the additional information.
                (c) Information required to process requests for reconsideration. (1) The covered individual must put the request to the Carrier to reconsider a claim in writing and give the reasons, in terms of applicable brochure provisions, that the denied claim should have been approved.
                (2) If the Carrier needs additional information from the covered individual to make a decision, it must:
                (i) Specifically identify the information needed;
                (ii) State the reason the information is required to make a decision on the claim;
                (iii) Specify the time limit (60 days after the date of the Carrier's request) for submitting the information; and
                (iv) State the consequences of failure to respond within the time limit specified, as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
                (d) Carrier determinations. The Carrier must provide written notice to the covered individual of its determination. If the Carrier affirms the initial denial, the notice must inform the covered individual of:
                (1) The specific and detailed reasons for the denial;
                (2) The covered individual's right to request a review by OPM; and
                (3) The requirement that requests for OPM review must be received within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's denial notice and include a copy of the denial notice as well as documents to support the covered individual's position.
                (e) OPM review. (1) If the covered individual seeks further review of the denied claim, the covered individual must make a request to OPM to review the Carrier's decision. Such a request to OPM must be made:
                (i) Within 90 days after the date of the Carrier's notice to the covered individual that the denial was affirmed; or
                (ii) If the Carrier fails to respond to the covered individual as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, within 120 days after the date of the covered individual's timely request for reconsideration by the Carrier; or
                (iii) Within 120 days after the date the Carrier requests additional information from the covered individual, or the date the covered individual is notified that the Carrier is requesting additional information from a provider. OPM may extend the time limit for a covered individual's request for OPM review when the covered individual shows he or she was not notified of the time limit or was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the request for OPM review within the time limit.
                (2) In reviewing a claim denied by the Carrier, OPM may:
                (i) Request that the covered individual submit additional information;
                (ii) Obtain an advisory opinion from an independent physician;
                (iii) Obtain any other information as may in its judgment be required to make a determination; or
                (iv) Make its decision based solely on the information the covered individual provided with his or her request for review.
                (3) When OPM requests information from the Carrier, the Carrier must release the information within 30 days after the date of OPM's written request unless a different time limit is specified by OPM in its request.
                (4) Within 90 days after receipt of the request for review, OPM will either:
                (i) Give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and the Carrier; or
                (ii) Notify the individual of the status of the review. If OPM does not receive requested evidence within 15 days after expiration of the applicable time limit in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, OPM may make its decision based solely on information available to it at that time and give a written notice of its decision to the covered individual and to the Carrier.
                (f) OPM, upon its own motion, may reopen its review if it receives evidence that was unavailable at the time of its original decision.
                (g) Court review. (1) A suit to compel enrollment under § 890.102 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, must be brought against the employing office that made the enrollment decision.
                (2) A suit to review the legality of OPM's regulations under this part must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management.
                (3) Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) carriers resolve FEHB claims under authority of Federal statute (chapter 89, title 5, United States Code). A covered individual may seek judicial review of OPM's final action on the denial of a health benefits claim. A legal action to review final action by OPM involving such denial of health benefits must be brought against OPM and not against the Carrier or the Carrier's subcontractors. The recovery in such a suit shall be limited to a court order directing OPM to require the Carrier to pay the amount of benefits in dispute.
                (4) An action under paragraph (3) of this clause to recover on a claim for health benefits:
                (i) May not be brought prior to exhaustion of the administrative remedies provided in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this clause;
                (ii) May not be brought later than December 31 of the 3rd year after the year in which the care or service was provided; and
                (iii) Will be limited to the record that was before OPM when it rendered its decision affirming the Carrier's denial of benefits.

                (a) Definitions.
                  Common parent, as used in this provision, means that corporate entity that owns or controls an affiliated group of corporations that files its Federal income tax returns on a consolidated basis, and of which the Carrier is a member.
                
                  Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), as used in this provision, means the number required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to be used by the Carrier in reporting income tax and other returns.
                (b) The Carrier must submit the information required in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this clause to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the IRS. The Carrier is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.904. The Carrier's failure or refusal to furnish the information will result in payment being withheld until the TIN number is provided.
                (c) The Government may use the TIN to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the Carrier's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). The TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify its accuracy.

              Large provider agreements.
              As prescribed by 1604.7202, the contracting officer will insert the following clause in all FEHB Program contracts based on cost analysis (experience-rated):
              
                Large Provider Agreements (OCT 2005)
                (a) Notification and Information Requirements. (1) The experience-rated Carrier must provide notice to the contracting officer of its intent to enter into or to make a significant modification of a Large Provider Agreement:
                (i) Not less than 60 days before entering into any Large Provider Agreement; and
                (ii) Not less than 60 days before exercising a renewal or other option, or significant modification to a Large Provider Agreement, when such action would result in total costs to the FEHB Program of an additional 20 percent or more above the existing contract. However, if a carrier is exercising a simple renewal or other option contemplated by a Large Provider Agreement that OPM previously reviewed, and there are no significant changes, then a statement to the effect that the renewal or other option is being exercised along with the dollar amount is sufficient notice.
                (2) The carrier's notification to the contracting officer must be in writing and must, at a minimum:
                (i) Describe the supplies and/or services the proposed provider agreement will require;
                (ii) Identify the proposed basis for reimbursement;
                (iii) Identify the proposed provider agreement, explain why the carrier selected the proposed provider, and what contracting method it used, where applicable, including the kind of competition obtained;
                (iv) Describe the methodology the carrier used to compute the provider's profit; and,
                (v) Describe provider risk provisions.
                (3) The Contracting officer may request from the carrier any additional information on a proposed provider agreement and its terms and conditions prior to a provider award and during the performance of the agreement.
                (4) Within 30 days of receiving the carrier's notification, the Contracting officer will give the carrier either written comments or written notice that there will be no comments. If the Contracting officer comments, the carrier must respond in writing within 10 calendar days, and explain how it intends to address any concerns.
                (5) When computing the carrier's service charge, the Contracting officer will consider how well the carrier complies with the provisions of this section, including the advance notification requirements, as an aspect of the carrier's performance factor.

                (6) The Contracting officer's review of any Large Provider Agreement, option, renewal, or modification will not constitute a determination of the acceptability of the terms and conditions of any provider agreement or of the allowability of any costs under the carrier's contract, nor will it relieve the carrier of any responsibility for performing the contract.
                (b) Records and Inspection. The carrier must insert in all Large Provider Agreements the requirement that the provider will retain and make available to the Government all records relating to the agreement that support the annual statement of operations and enrollee records—Retain for 6 years after the agreement term ends.
                (c) Audit and Records—Negotiation. The provisions of FAR 52.215-2, “Audit and Records—Negotiation,” when required, or FEHBAR 1652.246-70, “FEHB Inspection” apply to all experience-rated Carriers' Large Provider Agreements. The Carrier will insert the clauses at FAR 52.215-2, when applicable, or FEHBAR 1652.246-70 in all Large Provider Agreements. In FAR 52.215-2 the carrier will substitute:
                (1) The term “Large Provider” for the term “Contractor” throughout the clause, and
                (2) The term “Large Provider Agreement” for the term “Subcontracts” in paragraph (g) of FAR 52.215-2. The term “Contracting officer” will mean the FEHB Program Contracting officer at OPM. The carrier will be responsible for ensuring the Large Provider complies with the provisions set forth in the clause.
                (d) Prohibited Agreements. No provider agreement made under this contract will provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis.
                (e) The carrier will insert this clause, 1652.204-74, in all Large Provider Agreements.

              Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or Pricing Data.
              As prescribed in 1615.407-1, the following clause shall be inserted in FEHBP contracts exceeding the threshold at FAR 15.403-4(a)(1) that are based on a combination of cost and price analysis (community rated):
              
                Rate Reduction for Defective Pricing or Defective Cost or Pricing Data (JAN 2004)
                (a) If any rate established in connection with this contract was increased because:
                (1) The Carrier submitted, or kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, or current as certified in one of the Certificates of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data (FEHBAR 1615.406-2);
                (2) The Carrier submitted, or kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, cost or pricing data that were not accurate as represented in the rate reconciliation documents or MLR Calculation;
                (3) The Carrier developed FEHBP rates for traditional community rated plans with a rating methodology and structure inconsistent with that used to develop rates for a similarly sized subscriber group (see FEHBAR 1602.170-13) as certified in the Certificate of Accurate Cost or Pricing Data for Community Rated Carriers;
                (4) The Carrier, who is not mandated by the State to use traditional community rating, developed FEHBP rates with a rating methodology and structure inconsistent with its State-filed rating methodology (or if not required to file with the State, their standard written and established rating methodology) or inconsistent with the FEHB specific medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements (see FEHBAR 1602.170-13); or
                (5) The Carrier submitted or, kept in its files in support of the FEHBP rate, data or information of any description that were not complete, accurate, and current—then, the rate shall be reduced in the amount by which the price was increased because of the defective data or information.
                (b)(1) If the Contracting Officer determines under paragraph (a) of this clause that a price or cost reduction should be made, the Carrier agrees not to raise the following matters as a defense:
                (i) The Carrier was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a superior bargaining position and thus the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted or maintained and identified.
                (ii) The Contracting Officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the Carrier took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the Contracting Officer.
                (iii) The contract was based on an agreement about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract.
                (iv) The Carrier did not submit or keep in its files a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data.
                (2)(i) Except as prohibited by subdivision (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, an offset in an amount determined appropriate by the Contracting Officer based upon the facts shall be allowed against the amount of a contract price reduction if—
                (A) The Carrier certifies to the Contracting Officer that, to the best of the Carrier's knowledge and belief, the Carrier is entitled to the offset in the amount requested; and

                (B) The Carrier proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) and that the data were not submitted before such date.
                (ii) An offset shall not be allowed if—
                (A) The understated data was known by the Carrier to be understated when the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data was signed; or
                (B) The Government proves that the facts demonstrate that the contract price would not have increased in the amount to be offset even if the available data had been submitted before the date of agreement on price.
                (c) When the Contracting Officer determines that the rates shall be reduced and the Government is thereby entitled to a refund or that the Government is entitled to a MLR penalty, the Carrier shall be liable to and shall pay the FEHB Fund at the time the overpayment is repaid or at the time the MLR penalty is paid—
                (1) Simple interest on the amount of the overpayment from the date the overpayment was paid from the FEHB Fund to the Carrier until the date the overcharge is liquidated. In calculating the amount of interest due, the quarterly rate determinations by the Secretary of the Treasury under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable to the periods the overcharge was retained by the Carrier shall be used;
                (2) A penalty equal to the amount of overpayment, if the Carrier knowingly submitted cost or pricing data which was incomplete, inaccurate, or noncurrent; and,
                (3) Simple interest on the MLR penalty from the date on which the penalty should have been paid to the FEHB Fund to the date on which the penalty was or will be actually paid to the FEHB fund. The interest rate shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

                Investment Income (JAN 1998)
                (a) The Carrier shall invest and reinvest all FEHB funds on hand that are in excess of the funds needed to promptly discharge the obligations incurred under this contract. The Carrier shall seek to maximize investment income with prudent consideration to the safety and liquidity of investments.
                (b) All investment income earned on FEHB funds shall be credited to the Special Reserve on behalf of the FEHBP.
                (c) When the Contracting Officer concludes that the Carrier failed to comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this clause, the Carrier shall credit the Special Reserve with investment income that would have been earned, at the rate(s) specified in paragraph (f) of this clause, had it not been for the Carrier's noncompliance. “Failed to comply with paragraph (a) or (b)” means: (1) Making any charges against the contract which are not allowable, allocable, or reasonable; or (2) failing to credit any income due the contract and/or failing to place excess funds, including subscription income and payments from OPM not needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract, refunds, credits, payments, deposits, investment income earned, uncashed checks, or other amounts owed the Special Reserve, in income producing investments and accounts.
                (d) Investment income lost as a result of unallowable, unallocable, or unreasonable charges against the contract shall be paid from the 1st day of the contract term following the contract term in which the unallowable charge was made and shall end on the earlier of: (1) The date the amounts are returned to the Special Reserve (or the Office of Personnel Management); (2) the date specified by the Contracting Officer; or, (3) the date of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision.
                (e) Investment income lost as a result of failure to credit income due the contract or failure to place excess funds in income producing investments and accounts shall be paid from the date the funds should have been invested or appropriate income was not credited and shall end on the earlier of: (1) The date the amounts are returned to the Special Reserve (or the Office of Personnel Management); (2) the date specified by the Contracting Officer; or, (3) the date of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision.
                (f) The Carrier shall credit the Special Reserve for income due in accordance with this clause. All lost investment income payable shall bear simple interest at the quarterly rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2) applicable to the periods in which the amount becomes due, as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.

All other carriers will be subject to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause.

The ratio of a plan's incurred claims, including the carrier's expenditures for activities that improve health care quality, to total premium revenue shall not be lower than the FEHB-specific MLR threshold published annually by OPM in its rate instructions.
                (ii) The subscription rates agreed to in this contract shall be equivalent to the subscription rates given to the carrier's similarly sized subscriber group (SSSG) as defined in FEHBAR 1602.170-13. The subscription rates shall be determined according to the carrier's established policy, which must be applied consistently to the FEHBP and to the carrier's SSSG. If the SSSG receives a rate lower than that determined according to the carrier's established policy, it is considered a discount. The FEHBP must receive a discount equal to or greater than the carrier's SSSG discount.
                (3) If subject to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, then:
                (i) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription rates are found to be lower than the equivalent rates for the SSSG, the carrier may include an adjustment to the Federal group's rates for the next contract period, except as noted in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this clause.
                (ii) If, at the time of the rate reconciliation, the subscription rates are found to be higher than the equivalent rates for the SSSG, the carrier shall reimburse the Fund, for example, by reducing the FEHB rates for the next contract term to reflect the difference between the estimated rates and the rates which are derived using the methodology of the SSSG, except as noted in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this clause.
                (iii) Carriers may provide additional guaranteed discounts to the FEHBP that are not given to the SSSG. Any such guaranteed discounts must be clearly identified as guaranteed discounts. After the beginning of the contract year for which the rates are set, these guaranteed FEHBP discounts may not be adjusted.
                (4) If rates are determined by comparison with the FEHB-specific MLR threshold, then if the MLR for the carrier's FEHB plan is found to be lower than the published FEHB-specific MLR threshold, the carrier must pay a subsidization penalty equal to the difference into a subsidization penalty account.
                (5) The following apply to community rated plans, regardless of the rating methodology:
                (i) No upward adjustment in the rate established for this contract will be allowed or considered by the Government or will be made by the Carrier in this or in any other contract period on the basis of actual costs incurred, actual benefits provided, or actual size or composition of the FEHBP group during this contract period.
                (ii) For contract years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, in the event this contract is not renewed, the final rate reconciliation will be performed. The carrier must promptly pay any amount owed to OPM. Any amount recoverable by the carrier is limited to the amount in the contingency reserve for the terminating plan as of December 31 of the terminating year.
                (iii) Carriers may not impose surcharges (loadings not defined based on an established rating method) on the FEHBP subscription rates or use surcharges in the rate reconciliation process in any circumstance.
                (6) For contract years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, in the event this contract is not renewed, the final rate reconciliation will be performed. The carrier must promptly pay any amount owed to OPM. Any amount recoverable by the carrier is limited to the amount in the contingency reserve for the terminating plan as of December 31 of the terminating year.
                (7) Carriers may provide additional guaranteed discounts to the FEHBP. Any such guaranteed discounts must be clearly identified as guaranteed discounts. After the beginning of the contract year for which the rates are set, these guaranteed FEHBP discounts may not be adjusted.

                (8) Carriers may not impose surcharges (loadings not defined based on an established rating method) on the FEHBP subscription rates or use surcharges in the rate reconciliation process. If the carrier is subject to the SSSG rules and imposes a surcharge on the SSSG, the carrier cannot impose the surcharge on FEHB.

              1652.216-71
              Accounting and Allowable Cost.
              As prescribed in section 1616.7002, the following clause shall be inserted in all FEHBP contracts based on cost analysis (experience rated).
              
                Accounting and Allowable Cost (FEHBAR 1652.216-71) (JAN 2003)
                (a) Annual Accounting Statements. (1) The Carrier shall furnish to OPM an accounting of its operations under the contract. In preparing the accounting, the Carrier shall follow the reporting requirements and statement formats prescribed by OPM in the OPM Annual and Fiscal Year Financial Reporting Instructions.
                (2) The Carrier shall have its Annual Accounting Statements and that of its underwriter, if any, audited in accordance with the FEHBP Experienced-Rated Carrier and Service Organization Audit Guide (Guide). The Carrier shall submit the audit report and the Annual Accounting Statements to OPM in accordance with the requirements of the Guide.
                (3) Based on the results of either the independent audit prescribed by the Guide or a Government audit, OPM may require the Carrier adjust its annual accounting statements (i) by amounts found not to constitute actual, allowable, allocable and reasonable costs; or (ii) to reflect prior overpayments or underpayments.
                (4) The Carrier shall develop corrective action plans to resolve audit findings identified in audits that were performed in accordance with the Guide. The corrective action plans will be prepared in accordance with and as defined by the Guide.
                (b) Definition of costs. (1) The Carrier may charge a cost to the contract for a contract term if the cost is actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable. In addition, the Carrier must:
                (i) on request, document and make available accounting support for the cost to justify that the cost is actual, reasonable and necessary; and
                (ii) determine the cost in accordance with: (A) the terms of this contract, and (B) subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and subpart 1631.2 of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Acquisition Regulation (FEHBAR) applicable on the first day of the contract period.
                (2) In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary, the Carrier shall classify contract costs in accordance with the following criteria:
                (i) Benefits. Benefit costs consist of payments made and liabilities incurred for covered health care services on behalf of FEHBP subscribers less any refunds, rebates, allowances or other credits received.
                (ii) Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses consist of all actual, allowable, allocable and reasonable expenses incurred in the adjudication of subscriber benefit claims or incurred in the Carrier's overall operation of the business. Unless otherwise stated in the contract, administrative expenses include, in part: all taxes (excluding premium taxes, as provided in section 1631.205-41), insurance and reinsurance premiums, medical and dental consultants used in the adjudication process, concurrent or managed care review when not billed by a health care provider and other forms of utilization review, the cost of maintaining eligibility files, legal expenses incurred in the litigation of benefit payments and bank charges for letters of credit. Administrative expenses exclude the cost of Carrier personnel, equipment, and facilities directly used in the delivery of health care services, which are benefit costs, and the expense of managing the FEHBP investment program which is a reduction of investment income earned.
                (iii) Investment income. While compliance with the checks presented letter of credit methodology will minimize funds on hand, the Carrier shall invest and reinvest all funds on hand, including any in the Special Reserve or any attributable to the reserve for incurred but unpaid claims, which are in excess of the funds needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract. Investment income represents the net amount earned by the Carrier after deducting investment expenses. Investment expenses are those actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable contract costs that are attributable to the investment of funds, such as consultant or management fees.
                (iv) Other charges. (A) Mandatory statutory reserve. Charges for mandatory statutory reserves are not allowable unless specifically provided for in the contract. When the term “mandatory statutory reserve” is specifically identified as an allowable contract charge without further definition or explanation, it means a requirement imposed by State law upon the Carrier to set aside a specific amount or rate of funds into a restricted reserve that is accounted for separately from all other reserves and surpluses of the Carrier and which may be used only with the specific approval of the State official designated by law to make such approvals. The amount chargeable to the contract may not exceed an allocable portion of the amount actually set aside. If the statutory reserve is no longer required for the purpose for which it was created, and these funds become available for the general use of the Carrier, the Carrier shall return to the FEHBP a pro rata share based upon FEHBP's contribution to the total Carrier's set aside shall be returned to the FEHBP in accordance with FAR 31.201-5.
                (B) Premium taxes. (1) When the term “premium taxes” is used in this contract without further definition or explanation, it means a tax, fee, or other monetary payment directly or indirectly imposed on FEHB premiums by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority of those entities, with the sole exception of a tax on net income or profit, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.
                (2) For purposes of this paragraph (B), OPM has determined that the term “State” as used in 5 U.S.C. 8909(f) includes, but is not limited to, a territory or possession of the United States.
                (c) Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy. (1) The Carrier shall certify the annual and fiscal year accounting statements in the form set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The Carrier's chief executive officer and the chief financial officer shall sign the certificate.
                (2) The Carrier shall require an authorized agent of its underwriter, if any, also to certify the annual accounting statement.
                (3) The certificate required shall be in the following form:
                Certification of Accounting Statement Accuracy
                This is to certify that I have reviewed this accounting statement and to the best of my knowledge and belief:

                Notice of Significant Events (JUL 2005)
                (a) The Carrier agrees to notify OPM of any Significant Event within ten (10) working days after the Carrier becomes aware of it. As used in this section, a Significant Event is any occurrence or anticipated occurrence that might reasonably be expected to have a material effect upon the Carrier's ability to meet its obligations under this contract, including, but not limited to, any of the following:
                (1) Disposal of major assets;
                (2) Loss of 15% or more of the Carrier's overall membership;
                (3) Termination or modification of any contract or subcontract if such termination or modification might have a material effect on the Carrier's obligations under this contract;
                (4) Addition or termination of provider agreements;
                (5) Any changes in underwriters, reinsurers, or participating plans;

                (6) The imposition of, or notice of the intent to impose, a receivership, conservatorship, or special regulatory monitoring;
                
                (7) The withdrawal of, or notice of intent to withdraw, State licensing, HHS qualification, or any other status under Federal or State law;
                (8) Default on a loan or other financial obligation;
                (9) Any actual or potential labor dispute that delays or threatens to delay timely performance or substantially impairs the functioning of the Carrier's facilities or facilities used by the Carrier in the performance of the contract;
                (10) Any change in its charter, constitution, or by-laws which affects any provision of this contract or the Carrier's participation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; or

                (12) Any fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation of FEHB funds; or
                (13) Any written exceptions, reservations or qualifications expressed by the independent accounting firm (which ascribes to the standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) contracted with by the Carrier to provide an opinion on its annual financial statements.
                (b) Upon learning of a Significant Event OPM may institute action, in proportion to the seriousness of the event, to protect the interest of Members, including, but not limited to—
                (1) Directing the Carrier to take corrective action;
                (2) Suspending new enrollments under this contract;

                (6) Terminating this contract pursuant to section 1.15, renewal and withdrawal of approval.
                (c) Prior to taking action as described in paragraph (b) of this clause, the OPM will notify the Carrier and offer an opportunity to respond.
                (d) The carrier will insert this clause in any subcontract or subcontract modification if the amount of the subcontract or modification charged to the FEHB Program (or in the case of a community-rated carrier, applicable to the FEHB Program) equals or exceeds $550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total subcontract cost. The amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB Program shall be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 254b(a)(7).

Release of information for medical research or educational purposes shall be limited to aggregated information of a statistical nature that does not identify any individual by name, social security number, or any other identifier unique to an individual.

              As prescribed in section 1629.402, the following clause shall be inserted in all FEHBP contracts performed outside the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico:
              
                Taxes—Foreign Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998)
                (a) To the extent that this contract provides for performing services outside the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, this clause applies in lieu of any Federal, State, and local taxes clause of the contract.
                (b) “Contract date,” as used in this clause, means the effective date of this contract or modification.
                “Country concerned,” as used in this clause, means any country, other than the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico, in which expenditures under this contract are made.
                “Tax” and “taxes,” as used in this clause, include fees and charges for doing business that are levied by the government of the country concerned or by its political subdivisions.
                “All applicable taxes and duties,” as used in this clause, means all taxes and duties, in effect on the contract date, that the taxing authority is imposing and collecting on the transactions covered by this contract, pursuant to written ruling or regulation in effect on the contract date.
                “After-imposed tax,” as used in this clause, means any new or increased tax or duty, or tax that was exempted or excluded on the contract date but whose exemption was later revoked or reduced during the contract period, other than excepted tax, on the transactions covered by this contract that the Carrier is required to pay or bear as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.
                “After-relieved tax,” as used in this clause, means any amount of tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been payable on the transactions covered by this contract, but which the Carrier is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Carrier obtains a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.
                “Excepted tax,” as used in this clause, means social security or other employment taxes, net income and franchise taxes, excess profits taxes, capital stock taxes, transportation taxes, unemployment compensation taxes, and property taxes. “Excepted tax” does not include gross income taxes levied on or measured by sales or receipts from sales covered by this contract, or any tax assessed on the Carrier's possession of, interest in, or use of property, title to which is in the U.S. Government.
                (c) Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all applicable taxes and duties, except taxes and duties that the Government of the United States and the government of the country concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on behalf of the United States.
                (d) The contract price shall be increased by the amount of any after-imposed tax or of any tax or duty specifically excluded from the contract price by a provision of this contract that the Carrier is required to pay or bear, including any interest or penalty, if the Carrier states in writing that the contract price does not include any contingency for such tax and if liability for such tax, interest, or penalty was not incurred through the Carrier's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.
                (e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to interest received by the Carrier incident to a refund of taxes to the extent that such interest was earned after the Carrier was paid by the Government of the United States for such taxes. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to repayment of any penalty refunded to the Carrier to the extent that the penalty was paid by the Government.
                (f) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that was included in the contract and that the Carrier is required to pay or bear, or does not obtain a refund of, through the Carrier's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.
                (g) No adjustment shall be made in the contract price under this clause unless the amount of the adjustment exceeds $250.
                (h) If the Carrier obtains a reduction in tax liability under the United States Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, U.S. Code) because of the payment of any tax or duty that either was included in the contract price or was the basis of an increase in the contract price, the amount of the reduction shall be paid or credited to the Government of the United States as the Contracting Officer directs.
                (i) The Carrier shall take all reasonable action to obtain exemption from or refund of any taxes or duties, including interest or penalty, from which the United States Government, the Carrier, any subcontractor, or the transactions covered by this contract are exempt under the laws of the country concerned or its political subdivisions or which the governments of the United States and of the country concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on behalf of the United States.

                (j) The Carrier shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of all matters relating to taxes or duties that reasonably may be expected to result in either an increase or decrease in the contract price and shall take appropriate action as the Contracting Officer directs. The contract price shall be equitably adjusted to cover the costs of action taken by the Carrier at the direction of the Contracting Officer, including any interest, penalty, and reasonable attorneys' fees.

                (a) The Carrier and/or its underwriter shall keep all FEHBP funds for this contract (cash and investments) physically separate from funds obtained from other sources.

                (b) In certain instances the physical separation of FEHBP funds may not be practical or desirable. In such cases, the Carrier may request a waiver from this requirement from the Contracting Officer. The waiver shall be requested in advance and the Carrier shall demonstrate that accounting techniques have been established that will clearly measure FEHBP cash and investment income (i.e., subsidiary ledgers). Reconciliations between amounts reported and actual amounts shown in accounting records shall be provided as supporting schedules to the Annual Accounting Statements.
                (c) The Carrier shall incorporate this clause in all subcontracts that exceed $25,000 and shall substitute “contractor” or other appropriate reference for “Carrier and/or its underwriter.”

                Changes—Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998)
                (a) The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract in any one or more of the following:
                (1) Description of services to be performed.
                (2) Time of performance (i.e., hours of the day, days of the week, etc.).
                (3) Place of performance of the services.
                (b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.
                (c) The Carrier must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract.
                (d) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Carrier from proceeding with the contract as changed.

              Subcontracts.
              As prescribed in section 1644.270, the following clause will be inserted in all FEHB Program contracts based on cost analysis (experience-rated):
              
                Subcontracts (JUL 2005)

                (a) The carrier will notify the Contracting officer in writing at least 30 days in advance of entering into any subcontract or subcontract modification, or as otherwise specified by this contract, if the amount of the subcontract or modification charged to the FEHB Program equals or exceeds $550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total subcontract cost. The amount of the dollar charge to the FEHB Program shall be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 254b(a)(7). Failure to provide advance notice may result in a Contracting officer's disallowance of subcontract costs or a penalty in the performance aspect of the carrier's service charge. In determining whether the amount chargeable to the FEHB Program contract for a given subcontract or modification equals or exceeds the $550,000 threshold, the following rules apply:
                (1) For initial advance notification, the carrier shall add the total cost/price for the base year and all options, including quantity or service options and option periods.
                (2) For contract modifications, options and/or renewals (e.g. evergreen contracts) not accounted for in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, the carrier shall provide advance notification if they cause the total price to equal or exceed the threshold. OPM's review will be of the modification(s), itself, but documentation for the original subcontract will be required to perform the review. The $550,000 threshold will be adjusted by the same amount and at the same time as any change to the threshold for application of the Truth in Negotiations Act. All subcontracts or subcontract modifications that equal or exceed the threshold are subject to audit under FAR 52.215-2 “Audit and Records—Negotiations” if based on cost analysis or 48 CFR 1646.301 and 1552.246-70 “FEHB Inspection” if based on price analysis.
                (b) The advance notification required by paragraph (a) of this clause will include the information specified below:
                (1) A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted;
                (2) Identification of the type of subcontract to be used;
                (3) Identification of the proposed subcontractor and an explanation of why and how the proposed subcontractor was selected, including the competition obtained;
                (4) The proposed subcontract price and the carrier's cost or price analysis;
                (5) The subcontractor's current, complete, and accurate cost or pricing data and a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data must be submitted to the Contracting officer if required by law, regulation, or other contract provisions.
                (6) [Reserved]
                (7) A negotiation memorandum reflecting—
                (i) The principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations;
                (ii) The most significant consideration controlling establishment of initial or revised prices;
                (iii) An explanation of the reason cost or pricing data are not required, if the carrier believes that cost or pricing data are not required.
                (iv) The extent, if any, to which the carrier did not rely on the subcontractor's cost or pricing data in determining the price objective and in negotiating the final price;
                (v) The extent, if any, to which it was recognized in the negotiation that the subcontractor's cost or pricing data were not accurate, complete, or current; the action taken by the carrier and the subcontractor; and the effect of any such defective data on the total price negotiated;
                (vi) The reasons for any significant difference between the carrier's price objective and the price negotiated; and
                (vii) A complete explanation of the incentive fee or profit plan, when incentives are used. The explanation will identify each critical performance element, management decisions used to quantify each incentive element, reasons for the incentives, and a summary of all trade-off possibilities considered.
                (c) The carrier will obtain the Contracting officer's written consent before placing any subcontract for which advance notification is required under paragraph (a) of this clause. However, the Contracting officer may ratify in writing any such subcontract for which written consent was not obtained. Ratification will constitute the consent of the Contracting officer.
                (d) The Contracting officer may waive the requirement for advance notification and consent required by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this clause where the carrier and subcontractor submit an application or renewal as a contractor team arrangement as defined in FAR subpart 9.6 and—
                (1) The Contracting officer evaluated the arrangement during negotiation of the contract or contract renewal; and
                (2) The subcontractor's price and/or costs were included in the Plan's rates that were reviewed and approved by the Contracting officer during negotiation of the contract or contract renewal.
                (e) If the carrier follows the notification and consent requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this clause and subsequently obtains the Contracting officer's consent or ratification, then the reasonableness of the subcontract's costs will be inferred as provided for in 1631.205-81. However, consent or ratification by the Contracting officer will not constitute a determination:
                (1) Of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or conditions;
                (2) Of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or
                (3) That the carrier should be relieved of any responsibility for performing this contract.

                (f) No subcontract placed under this contract will provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. Any fee payable under cost reimbursement type subcontracts will not exceed the fee limitations in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i). Any profit or fee payable under a subcontract will be in accordance with the provision of Section 3.7, Service Charge.
                
                (g) The carrier will give the Contracting officer immediate written notice of any action or suit filed and prompt notice of any claim made against the carrier by any subcontractor or vendor that, in the opinion of the carrier, may result in litigation related in any way to this contract with respect to which the carrier may be entitled to reimbursement from the Government.

                Government Property (Negotiated Benefits Contracts) (JAN 1998)
                (a) Government-furnished property. (1) The Government shall deliver to the Carrier, for use in connection with and under the terms of this contract, the Government-furnished property described in this contract together with any related data and information that the Carrier may request and is reasonably required for the intended use of the property (hereinafter referred to as “Government-furnished property”).
                (2) The delivery or performance dates for this contract are based upon the expectation that Government-furnished property suitable for use (except for property furnished “as-is”) will be delivered to the Carrier at the times stated in this contract or, if not so stated, in sufficient time to enable the Carrier to meet the contract's performance dates.
                (3) If Government-furnished property is received by the Carrier in a condition not suitable for the intended use, the Carrier shall, upon receipt of it, notify the Contracting Officer, detailing the facts, and, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at Government expense, either repair, modify, return, or otherwise dispose of the property. After completing the directed action and upon written request of the Carrier, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment as provided in paragraph (h) of this clause.
                (b) Changes in Government-furnished property. (1) The Contracting Officer may, by written notice, (i) decrease the Government-furnished property provided or to be provided under this contract, or (ii) substitute other Government-furnished property for the property to be provided by the Government, or to be acquired by the Carrier for the Government, under this contract. The Carrier shall promptly take such action as the Contracting Officer may direct regarding the removal, shipment, or disposal of the property covered by such notice.
                (2) Upon the Carrier's written request, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment to the contract in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause, if the Government has agreed in this contract to make the property available for performing this contract and there is any—
                (i) Decrease or substitution in this property pursuant to subparagraph (b)(1) above; or
                (ii) Withdrawal of authority to use this property, if provided under any other contract or lease.
                (c) Title in Government property. (1) The Government shall retain title to all Government-furnished property.
                (2) All Government-furnished property and all property acquired by the Carrier, title to which vests in the Government under this paragraph (collectively referred to as “Government property”), are subject to the provisions of this clause. Title to Government property shall not be affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any property not owned by the Government, nor shall Government property become a fixture or lose its identity as personal property by being attached to any real property.
                (d) Use of Government property. The Government property shall be used only for performing this contract, unless otherwise provided in this contract or approved by the Contracting Officer.
                (e) Property administration. (1) The Carrier shall be responsible and accountable for all Government property provided under this contract and shall comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 45.5, as in effect on the date of this contract.
                (2) The Carrier shall establish and maintain a program for the use, maintenance, repair, protection, and preservation of Government property in accordance with sound industrial practice and the applicable provisions of subpart 45.5 of the FAR.
                (3) If damage occurs to Government property, the risk of which has been assumed by the Government under this contract, the Government shall replace the items or the Carrier shall make such repairs as the Government directs. However, if the Carrier cannot effect such repairs within the time required, the Carrier shall dispose of the property as directed by the Contracting Officer. When any property for which the Government is responsible is replaced or repaired, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in accordance with paragraph (h) of this clause.

                (4) The Carrier represents that the contract price does not include any amount for repairs or replacement for which the Government is responsible. Repair or replacement of property for which the Carrier is responsible shall be accomplished by the Carrier at its own expense.
                (f) Access. The Government and all its designees shall have access at all reasonable times to the premises in which any Government property is located for the purpose of inspecting the Government property.
                (g) Risk of loss. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the Carrier assumes the risk of, and shall be responsible for, any loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government property upon its delivery to the Carrier. However, the Carrier is not responsible for reasonable wear and tear to Government property or for Government property properly consumed in performing this contract.
                (h) Equitable adjustment. When this clause specifies an equitable adjustment, it shall be made to any affected contract provision in accordance with the procedures of the Changes clause. When appropriate, the Contracting Officer may initiate an equitable adjustment in favor of the Government. The right to an equitable adjustment shall be the Carrier's exclusive remedy. The Government shall not be liable to suit for breach of contract for—
                (1) Any delay in delivery of Government-furnished property;
                (2) Delivery of Government-furnished property in a condition not suitable for its intended use;
                (3) A decrease in or substitution of Government-furnished property; or
                (4) Failure to repair or replace Government property for which the Government is responsible.
                (i) Final accounting and disposition of Government property. Upon completing this contract, or at such earlier dates as may be fixed by the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall submit, in a form acceptable to the Contracting Officer, inventory schedules covering all items of Government property (including any resulting scrap) not consumed in performing this contract or delivered to the Government. The Carrier shall prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose of the Government property as may be directed or authorized by the Contracting Officer. The net proceeds of any such disposal shall be credited to the contract price or shall be paid to the Government as the Contracting Officer directs.
                (j) Abandonment and restoration of Carrier's premises. Unless otherwise provided herein, the Government—
                (1) May abandon any Government property in place, at which time all obligations of the Government regarding such abandoned property shall cease; and
                (2) Has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Carrier's premises under any circumstances (e.g., abandonment, disposition upon completion of need, or upon contract completion). However, if the Government-furnished property is withdrawn or is unsuitable for the intended use, or if other Government property is substituted, then the equitable adjustment under paragraph (h) of this clause may properly include restoration or rehabilitation costs.
                (k) Communications. All communications under this clause shall be in writing.
                (l) Overseas contracts. If this contract is to be performed outside of the United States of America, its territories, or possessions, the words “Government” and “Government-furnished” (wherever they appear in this clause) shall be construed as “United States Government” and “United States Government-furnished”, respectively.

                (b) The Contractor shall maintain and the Contracting officer, or an authorized representative of the Contracting officer, shall have the right to examine and audit all books and records relating to the contract for purposes of the Contracting officer's determination of the carrier's subcontractor or Large Provider's compliance with the terms of the contract, including its payment (including rebate and other financial arrangements) and performance provisions. The Contractor shall make available at its office at all reasonable times those books and records for examination and audit for the record retention period specified in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation (FEHBAR), 48 CFR 1652.204-70.

                (c) If the Contracting officer, or an authorized representative of the Contracting officer, performs inspection, audit or evaluation on the premises of the carrier, the subcontractor, or the Large Provider, the carrier shall furnish or require the subcontractor or Large Provider to furnish all reasonable facilities for the same and convenient performance of these duties.
                (d) The carrier shall insert this clause, including this subsection (d), in all subcontracts for underwriting and claim payments and administrative services and in all Large Provider Agreements and shall substitute “contractor” “Large Provider,” or other appropriate reference for the term “carrier.”

                (b) This contract also may be terminated at other times by order of OPM pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8902(e). After OPM notifies the Carrier of its intent to terminate the contract, OPM may take action as it deems necessary to protect the interests of members, including but not limited to—
                (1) Suspending new enrollments under the contract;
                (2) Advising enrollees of the asserted deficiencies; and
                (3) Providing enrollees an opportunity to transfer to another Plan.
                (c) OPM may, after proper notice, terminate the contract at the end of the contract term if it finds that the Carrier did not have at least 300 enrollees enrolled in its plan at any time during the two preceding contract terms.

              FEHBP termination for convenience of the government—negotiated benefits contracts.
              As prescribed in section 1649.101-71, the following clause shall be inserted in all FEHBP contracts.
              
                FEHBP Termination for Convenience of the Government—Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998)
                (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this contract in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest. The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Carrier a Notice of Termination specifying the extent of terminating and the effective date.
                (b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Carrier shall immediately proceed with the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining or adjusting any amounts due under this clause:
                (1) Stop work as specified in the notice.
                (2) Place no further subcontracts except as necessary to complete the continued portion of the contract.
                (3) Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work terminated.
                (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Carrier under the subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal arising out of those terminations.
                (5) With approval or ratification to the extent required by the Contracting Officer, settle all outstanding liabilities and termination settlement proposals arising from the termination of subcontracts; the approval or ratification will be final for purposes of this clause.
                (6) As directed by the Contracting Officer, deliver to the Government any data, reports, or studies that, if the contract had been completed, would be required to be furnished to the Government.
                (7) Complete performance of the work not terminated.

                (c) After termination, the Carrier shall submit a final termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The Carrier shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Carrier within this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received and acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Carrier fails to submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, due the Carrier because of the termination and shall pay the amount determined.
                
                (d) Subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, the Carrier and the Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount to be paid or remaining to be paid because of the termination. The amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done. However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (d) or paragraph (e) of this clause, exclusive of costs shown in subparagraph (e)(3) of this clause, may not exceed the total contract price as reduced by (1) the amount of payments previously made and (2) the contract price of work not terminated. The contract shall be modified, and the Carrier paid the agreed amount. Paragraph (e) of this clause shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon to be paid under this paragraph.
                (e) If the Carrier and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on the whole amount to be paid because of the termination of work, the Contracting Officer shall pay the Carrier the amounts determined by the Contracting Officer as follows, but without duplication of any amounts agreed on under paragraph (d) above:
                (1) The contract price for completed services accepted by the Government not previously paid for.
                (2) The total of—
                (i) The costs incurred in the performance of the work terminated, including initial costs and preparatory expense allocable thereto, but excluding any costs attributable to services paid or to be paid under paragraph (e)(1) of this clause;
                (ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision (e)(2)(i) of this clause; and
                (iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (e)(2)(i) of this clause, determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be fair and reasonable.
                (3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, including—
                (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and supporting data;
                (ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the amounts of such settlements); and
                (f) The cost principles and procedures of part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause.
                (g) The Carrier shall have the right of appeal, under the Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (c), (e), or (i) of this clause, except that if the Carrier failed to submit the termination settlement proposal or request for equitable adjustment within the time provided in paragraph (c) or (i), respectively, and failed to request a time extension, there is no right of appeal.
                (h) In arriving at the amount due the Carrier under this clause, there shall be deducted—
                (1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Carrier under the terminated portion of this contract;
                (2) Any claim which the Government has against the Carrier under this contract; and
                (i) If the termination is partial, the Carrier may file a proposal with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the Carrier for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 90 days from the effective date of termination unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.
                (j)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by the Carrier for the terminated portion of the contract, if the Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed the amount to which the Carrier will be entitled.
                (2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be due, the Carrier shall repay the excess to the Government upon demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by the Carrier to the date the excess is repaid.
                (k) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the Carrier shall maintain all records and documents relating to the terminated portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Carrier's costs and expenses under this contract. The Carrier shall make these records and documents available to the Government, at the Carrier's office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records and documents.

              FEHBP termination for default—negotiated benefits contracts.
              As prescribed in § 1649.101-72, the following clause shall be inserted in all FEHBP contracts.
              
                FEHBP Termination for Default—Negotiated Benefits Contracts (JAN 1998)
                (a) (1) The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of default to the Carrier, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Carrier fails to—
                (i) Perform the services within the time specified in this contract or any extension;
                (ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below); or
                (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).
                (2) The Government's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Carrier does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of the notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.
                (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or service similar to those terminated, and the Carrier will be liable to the Government for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However, the Carrier shall continue the work not terminated.
                (c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the Carrier shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Carrier. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Carrier.
                (d) If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the control of both the Carrier and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either, the Carrier shall not be liable for any excess costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies or services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for the Carrier to meet the required delivery schedule.
                (e) If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may require the Carrier to transfer title and deliver to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, any completed or partially completed information and contract rights that the Carrier has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract.
                (f) If, after termination, it is determined that the Carrier was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government.
                (g) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.

            1801.000
            Scope of part.
            This part sets forth general information about the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Supplement, also referred to as the NFS.
          
          
            Subpart 1801.1—Purpose, Authority, Issuance
            
              1801.103
              Authority. (NASA supplements paragraph (a))
              (a) Under the following authorities, the Administrator has delegated to the Assistant Administrator for Procurement authority to prepare, issue, and maintain the NFS:

              (i) The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (Public Law 85-568; 42 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.).
              (ii) 10 U.S.C. chapter 137.
              (iii) Other statutory authority.
              (iv) FAR subpart 1.3.
            
            
              1801.104
              Applicability.
              The NFS applies to all acquisitions as defined in FAR part 2 except those expressly excluded by the FAR or this chapter.
            
            
              1801.105
              Issuance.
            
            
              1801.105-1
              Publication and code arrangement.
              (b)(i) The NFS is an integrated document that contains both acquisition regulations that require public comment and internal Agency guidance and procedures that do not require public comment. NASA personnel must comply with all regulatory and internal guidance and procedures contained in the NFS.
              (ii) NFS regulations that require public comment are issued as chapter 18 of title 48, CFR.

              (iii) The single official NASA-maintained version of the NFS is on the Internet (https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/NFS.pdf).

              1801.105-2
              Arrangement of regulations. (NASA supplements paragraph (b))
              (b)(1)(A) Numbering of NFS text implementing the FAR shall be the same as that of the related FAR text, except when the NFS coverage exceeds one paragraph. In such case the NFS text is numbered by skipping a unit in the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence. For example, two paragraphs implementing FAR 1.105-2(b)(1) are numbered 1801.105-2(b)(1) (A) and (B), rather than (1) (i) and (ii). Further subdivision of the NFS implementing paragraphs would follow the prescribed sequence in FAR 1.105(b)(2).
              (B) NFS text that supplements the FAR is numbered the same as its FAR counterpart with the addition of a number 70 and up. For example, NFS supplement of FAR subsection 1.105-3 is numbered 1801.105-370. Supplemental text exceeding one paragraph is numbered using the FAR 1.105-2(b)(2) prescribed numbering sequence without skipping a unit.
              (2) Subdivision numbering below the fourth level repeats the numbering sequence using italicized letters and numbers.

              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart applies to NASA instead of FAR subpart 3.9.
              (a) This subpart implements 10 U.S.C. 2409 as amended by section 846 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Pub. L. 110-181), section 842 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110-417), and section 827 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239).
              (b) This subpart does not apply to any element of the intelligence community, as defined in 50 U.S.C. 3003(4). This subpart does not apply to any disclosure made by an employee of a contractor or subcontractor of an element of the intelligence community if such disclosure—
              (1) Relates to an activity or an element of the intelligence community; or
              (2) Was discovered during contract or subcontract services provided to an element of the intelligence community.
            
            
              1803.901
              Definition.
              
                Abuse of authority, as used in this subpart, means an arbitrary and capricious exercise of authority that is inconsistent with the mission of NASA or the successful performance of a NASA contract.
            
            
              1803.903
              Policy.
              (a) Policy. 10 U.S.C. 2409 prohibits contractors or subcontractors from discharging, demoting, or otherwise discriminating against an employee as a reprisal for disclosing, to any of the entities listed at paragraph (b) of this section, information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a NASA contract, a gross waste of NASA funds, an abuse of authority relating to a NASA contract, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a NASA contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract). Such reprisal is prohibited even if it is undertaken at the request of an executive branch official, unless the request takes the form of a non-discretionary directive and is within the authority of the executive branch official making the request.
              (b) Entities to whom disclosure may be made:
              (1) A Member of Congress or a representative of a committee of Congress.
              (2) The NASA Inspector General or any other Inspector General that has oversight over contracts awarded by or on behalf of NASA.
              (3) The Government Accountability Office.
              (4) A NASA employee responsible for contract oversight or management.
              (5) An authorized official of the Department of Justice or other law enforcement agency.
              (6) A court or grand jury.
              (7) A management official or other employee of the contractor or subcontractor who has the responsibility to investigate, discover, or address misconduct.
              (c) Disclosure clarified. An employee who initiates or provides evidence of contractor or subcontractor misconduct in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to waste, fraud, or abuse on a NASA contract shall be deemed to have made a disclosure.
              (d) Contracting officer actions. A contracting officer who receives a complaint of reprisal of the type described in paragraph (a) of this section shall forward it to legal counsel and to the NASA Inspector General.
            
            
              1803.904
              Procedures for filing complaints.
              (a) Any employee of a contractor or subcontractor who believes that he or she has been discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against contrary to the policy in 1803.903 may file a complaint with the Inspector General of NASA.
              (b) A complaint may not be brought under this section more than three years after the date on which the alleged reprisal took place.

              (1) The name of the contractor;
              (2) The contract number, if known; if not known, a description reasonably sufficient to identify the contract(s) involved;
              (3) The violation of law, rule, or regulation giving rise to the disclosure;
              (4) The nature of the disclosure giving rise to the discriminatory act, including the party to whom the information was disclosed; and

              1803.905
              Procedures for investigating complaints.
              (a) Unless the NASA Inspector General makes a determination that the complaint is frivolous, fails to allege a violation of the prohibition in 1803.903, or has been previously addressed in another Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding initiated by the complainant, the NASA Inspector General will investigate the complaint.
              (b) If the NASA Inspector General determines that a complaint merits further investigation, the NASA Inspector General will—
              (1) Notify the complainant, the contractor alleged to have committed the violation, and the head of the Agency;
              (2) Conduct an investigation; and
              (3) Provide a written report of findings to the complainant, the contractor alleged to have committed the violation, and the head of the Agency.
              (c) The NASA Inspector General—

              (2) If unable to submit a report within 180 days, will submit the report within the additional time period, up to 180 days, to which the person submitting the complaint agrees.
              (d) The NASA Inspector General may not respond to any inquiry or disclose any information from or about any person alleging the reprisal, except to the extent that such response or disclosure is—
              (1) Made with the consent of the person alleging reprisal;

              (2) Made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a (the Freedom of Information Act) or as required by any other applicable Federal law; or
              (3) Necessary to conduct an investigation of the alleged reprisal.
              (e) The legal burden of proof specified at paragraph (e) of 5 U.S.C. 1221 (Individual Right of Action in Certain Reprisal Cases) shall be controlling for the purposes of an investigation conducted by the NASA Inspector General, decision by the head of the Agency, or judicial or administrative proceeding to determine whether prohibited discrimination has occurred.
            
            
              1803.906
              Remedies.
              (a) Not later than 30 days after receiving a NASA Inspector General report in accordance with 1803.905, the head of the Agency shall determine whether sufficient basis exists to conclude that the contractor has subjected the complainant to a reprisal as prohibited by 1803.903 and shall either issue an order denying relief or shall take one or more of the following actions:
              (1) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate the reprisal.
              (2) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the position that the person held before the reprisal, together with compensatory damages (including back pay), employment benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.
              (3) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees) that were reasonably incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head of the Agency.
              (b) If the head of the Agency issues an order denying relief or has not issued an order within 210 days after the submission of the complaint or within 30 days after the expiration of an extension of time granted in accordance with 1803.905(3)(ii), and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant—
              (1) The complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with respect to the complaint; and
              (2) The complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against the contractor to seek compensatory damages and other relief available under 10 U.S.C. 2409 in the appropriate district court of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without regard to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a jury. An action under this authority may not be brought more than two years after the date on which remedies are deemed to have been exhausted.
              (c) Whenever a contractor fails to comply with an order issued by the head of agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2409, the head of the Agency or designee shall request the Department of Justice to file an action for enforcement of such order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and reasonable attorney fees and costs. The person upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join in an action filed by the head of the agency.
              (d) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued by the head of the Agency in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2409 may obtain judicial review of the order's conformance with the law, and the implementing regulation, in the United States Court of Appeals for a circuit in which the reprisal is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the agency or designee. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the order by the head of an agency, unless a stay is specifically entered by the court.

              (e) The rights and remedies provided for in this subpart may not be waived by any agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.

              Scope.

              This section implements NASA's acquisition requirements pertaining to Federal policies for the security of unclassified information and information systems. Federal policies include the Federal Information System Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12, Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (40 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security requirements and standards. These requirements safeguard IT services provided to NASA such as the management, operation, maintenance, development, and administration of hardware, software, firmware, computer systems, networks, and telecommunications systems.

              1804.470-2
              Policy.
              NASA IT security policies and procedures for unclassified information and IT are prescribed in NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 2810, Security of Information Technology; NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 2810, Security of Information Technology; and interim policy updates in the form of NASA Information Technology Requirements (NITR). IT services must be performed in accordance with these policies and procedures.

              1804.470-3
              IT security requirements.

              (a) These IT security requirements cover all NASA awards in which IT plays a role in the provisioning of services or products (e.g., research and development, engineering, manufacturing, IT outsourcing, human resources, and finance) that support NASA in meeting its institutional and mission objectives. These requirements are applicable when a contractor or subcontractor must obtain physical or electronic access beyond that granted the general public to NASA's computer systems, networks, or IT infrastructure. These requirements are applicable when NASA information is generated, stored, processed, or exchanged with NASA or on behalf of NASA by a contractor or subcontractor, regardless of whether the information resides on a NASA or a contractor/subcontractor's information system.

              (b) The Applicable Documents List (ADL) should consist of all NASA Agency-level IT Security and Center IT Security Policies applicable to the contract. Documents listed in the ADL as well as applicable Federal IT Security Policies are available at the NASA IT Security Policy Web site at: http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocio/itsecurity/index.html.

              Contract clause.

              (a) Insert the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources, in all solicitations and awards when contract performance requires contractors to—
              (1) Have physical or electronic access to NASA's computer systems, networks, or IT infrastructure; or
              (2) Use information systems to generate, store, process, or exchange data with NASA or on behalf of NASA, regardless of whether the data resides on a NASA or a contractor's information system.
              (b) Parts of the clause and referenced ADL may be waived by the contracting officer if the contractor's ongoing IT security program meets or exceeds the requirements of NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 2810.1 in effect at time of award. The current version of NPR 2810.1 is referenced in the ADL. The contractor shall submit a written waiver request to the Contracting Officer within 30 days of award. The waiver request will be reviewed by the Center IT Security Manager. If approved, the Contractor Officer will notify the contractor, by contract modification, which parts of the clause or provisions of the ADL are waived.

              Subcontractor responsibility.
              Generally, the Canadian Commercial Corporation's (CCC) proposal of a firm as its subcontractor is sufficient basis for an affirmative determination of responsibility. However, when the CCC determination of responsibility is not consistent with other information available to the contracting office, the contracting officer shall request from the CCC and any other sources whatever information is necessary to make the responsibility determination.
              Upon request, CCC shall be furnished the rationale for any subsequent determination of nonresponsibility.

              (a) The contracting officer shall provide written notification to a prospective contractor determined not responsible, which includes the basis for the determination. Notification provides the prospective contractor with the opportunity to take corrective action prior to future solicitations.

              For purposes of FAR subpart 9.4 and this subpart, the Deputy General Counsel is the “debarring official,” the “suspending official,” and the agency head's “designee.”

              Obtaining access to sensitive information.
              (b) In accordance with FAR 9.503, the Assistant Administrator for Procurement has determined that it would not be in the Government's interests for NASA to comply strictly with FAR 9.505-4(b) when acquiring services to support management activities and administrative functions. The Assistant Administrator for Procurement has, therefore, waived the requirement that before gaining access to other companies' proprietary or sensitive (see 1837.203-70) information contractors must enter specific agreements with each of those other companies to protect their information from unauthorized use or disclosure. Accordingly, NASA will not require contractors and subcontractors and their employees in procurements that support management activities and administrative functions to enter into separate, interrelated third party agreements to protect sensitive information from unauthorized use or disclosure. As an alternative to numerous, separate third party agreements, 1837.203-70 prescribes detailed policy and procedures to protect contractors from unauthorized use or disclosure of their sensitive information. Nothing in this section waives the requirements of FAR 37.204 and 1837.204.

              1812.7000
              Anchor tenancy contracts.
              (a) The term “anchor tenancy” means an arrangement in which the United States Government agrees to procure sufficient quantities of a commercial space product or service needed to meet Government mission requirements so that a commercial venture is made viable.
              (b) Subject to receiving an appropriation that:
              (1) Authorizes a multi-year anchor tenancy contract; and
              (2) Specifies the commercial space product or service to be developed or used, NASA may enter into a multi-year anchor tenancy contract only if Administrator determines—
              (i) The good or service meets the mission requirements of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;
              (ii) The commercially procured good or service is cost effective;
              (iii) The good or service is procured through a competitive process;
              (iv) Existing or potential customers for the good or service other than the United States Government have been specifically identified;
              (v) The long-term viability of the venture is not dependent upon a continued Government market or other nonreimbursable Government support; and
              (vi) Private capital is at risk in the venture.
              (c) Contracts entered into under such authority may provide for the payment of termination liability in the event that the Government terminates such contracts for its convenience.
              (1) Contracts that provide for this payment of termination liability shall include a fixed schedule of such termination liability payments. Liability under such contracts shall not exceed the total payments which the Government would have made after the date of termination to purchase the good or service if the contract were not terminated.
              (2) Subject to appropriations, funds available for such termination liability payments may be used for purchase of the good or service upon successful delivery of the good or service pursuant to the contract. In such case, sufficient funds shall remain available to cover any remaining termination liability.
              (d) Limitations. (1) Contracts entered into under such authority shall not exceed 10 years in duration.
              (2) Such contracts shall provide for delivery of the good or service on a firm, fixed price basis.

              (3) To the extent practicable, reasonable performance specifications shall be used to define technical requirements in such contracts.
              
              (4) In any such contract, the Administrator shall reserve the right to completely or partially terminate the contract without payment of such termination liability because of the contractor's actual or anticipated failure to perform its contractual obligations.

This provision shall not be used for acquisition of commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101.
              (2) This provision provides a single, consolidated list of certifications and representations for the acquisition of other than commercial items using simplified acquisition procedures and is attached to the solicitation for offerors to complete and return with their offer.
              (i) Use the provision with its Alternate I in solicitations for acquisitions that are for, or specify the use of recovered materials (see FAR 23.4).
              (ii) Use the provision with its Alternate II in solicitations for the acquisition of research, studies, supplies, or services of the type normally acquired from higher education institutions (see FAR 26.3).
              (iii) Use the provision with its Alternate III in solicitation which include the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General (see FAR 27.404(d)(2) and 1827.404(d)).

              (b) The contracting officer may insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 1852.213-71, Evaluation—Other than Commercial Items, in solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures for other than commercial items when a trade-off source selection process will be used, that is, factors in addition to technical acceptability and price will be considered.

              (a) NASA personnel participating in any way in the evaluation may not reveal any information concerning the evaluation to anyone not also participating, and then only to the extent that the information is required in connection with the evaluation. When non-NASA personnel participate, they shall be instructed to observe these restrictions.
              (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the procurement officer is the approval authority to disclose proposal information outside the Government. If outside evaluators are involved, this authorization may be granted only after compliance with FAR 37.2 and 1837.204, except that the determination of unavailability of Government personnel required by FAR 37.2 is not required for disclosure of proposal information to JPL employees.
              (2) Proposal information in the following classes of proposals may be disclosed with the prior written approval of a NASA official one level above the NASA program official responsible for the overall conduct of the evaluation. If outside evaluators are involved, the determination of unavailability of Government personnel required by FAR 37.2 is not required for disclosure in these instances.
              (i) Proposals submitted in response to broad agency announcements such as Announcements of Opportunity and NASA Research Announcements;
              (ii) Unsolicited proposals; and
              (iii) SBIR and STTR proposals.
              (3) If JPL personnel, in evaluating proposal information released to them by NASA, require assistance from non-JPL, non-Government evaluators, JPL must obtain written approval to release the information in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

              (b) Appointment as a special Government employee is a separate action from the approval required by paragraph 1815.207-70(b) and may be processed concurrently. Appointment as a special Government employee shall be made by:
              (1) The NASA Headquarters personnel office when the release of proposal information is to be made by a NASA Headquarters office; or
              (2) The installation personnel office when the release of proposal information is to be made by the installation.

For these solicitations, proposals or proposal modifications received from qualified firms after the latest date specified for receipt may be considered if a significant reduction in cost to the Government is probable or if there are significant technical advantages, as compared with proposals previously received. In such cases, the project office shall investigate the circumstances surrounding the late submission, evaluate its content, and submit written recommendations and findings to the selection official or a designee as to whether there is an advantage to the Government in considering it. The selection official or a designee shall determine whether to consider the late submission.

Insert the appropriate specific information relating to the conference.

              (b) When it is not in the Government's best interest to make award for less than the specified quantities solicited for certain items or groupings of items, the contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.214-71, Grouping for Aggregate Award. See 1814.201-670(b).

              (c) When award will be made only on the full quantities solicited, the contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.214-72, Full Quantities. See 1814.201-670(c).

              Identification of unacceptable proposals.
              (a) The contracting officer shall not complete the initial evaluation of any proposal when it is determined that the proposal is unacceptable because:
              (1) It does not represent a reasonable initial effort to address the essential requirements of the RFP or clearly demonstrates that the offeror does not understand the requirements;
              (2) In research and development acquisitions, a substantial design drawback is evident in the proposal, and sufficient correction or improvement to consider the proposal acceptable would require virtually an entirely new technical proposal; or
              (3) It contains major deficiencies or omissions or out-of-line costs which discussions with the offeror could not reasonably be expected to cure.
              (b) The contracting officer shall document the rationale for discontinuing the initial evaluation of a proposal in accordance with this section.

              (e)(1) In no case shall the contacting officer relax or amend RFP requirements for any offeror without amending the RFP and permitting the other offerors an opportunity to propose against the relaxed requirements.

              (a) NASA has waived the requirement for the submission of certified cost or pricing data when contracting with the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC). This waiver applies to the CCC and its subcontractors. The CCC will provide assurance of the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed price. This assurance should be relied on; however, contracting officers shall ensure that the appropriate level of data other than certified cost or pricing data is submitted by subcontractors to support any required proposal analysis, including a technical analysis and a cost realism analysis. The CCC also will provide for follow-up audit activity to ensure that any excess profits are found and refunded to NASA.
              
              (b) NASA has waived the requirement for the submission of certified cost or pricing data when contracting for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program Phase II contracts. However, contracting officers shall ensure that the appropriate level of data other than certified cost or pricing data is submitted to determine price reasonableness and cost realism.

This provision shall be used in conjunction with the clause at FAR 52.215-9, Changes or Additions to Make-or-Buy Program.

              The reference to notice of award in FAR 15.504 on negotiated acquisitions is a generic one. It relates only to the formal establishment of a contractual document obligating both the Government and the offeror. The notice is effected by the transmittal of a fully approved and executed definitive contract document, such as the award portion of SF 33, SF 26, SF 1449, or SF 1447, or a letter contract when a definitized contract instrument is not available but the urgency of the requirement necessitates immediate performance.

              (b) Give the offeror an opportunity to amend the unsolicited proposal to ensure compliance with the applicable NRA proposal preparation instructions. If these conditions cannot be met, the proposal must be evaluated separately.

              1816.303-70
              Cost-sharing contracts.
              (a) Cost-sharing with for-profit organizations. (1) Cost sharing by for-profit organizations is mandatory in any contract for basic or applied research resulting from an unsolicited proposal, and may be accepted in any other contract when offered by the proposing organization. The requirement for cost-sharing may be waived when the contracting officer determines in writing that the contractor has no commercial, production, education, or service activities that would benefit from the results of the research, and the contractor has no means of recovering its shared costs on such projects.
              (2) The contractor's cost-sharing may be any percentage of the project cost. In determining the amount of cost-sharing, the contracting officer shall consider the relative benefits to the contractor and the Government. Factors that should be considered include—
              (i) The potential for the contractor to recover its contribution from non-Federal sources;
              (ii) The extent to which the particular area of research requires special stimulus in the national interest; and
              (iii) The extent to which the research effort or result is likely to enhance the contractor's capability, expertise, or competitive advantage.
              (b) Cost-sharing with not-for-profit organizations. (1) Costs to perform research stemming from an unsolicited proposal by universities and other educational or not-for-profit institutions are usually fully reimbursed. When the contracting officer determines that there is a potential for significant benefit to the institution cost-sharing will be considered.
              (2) The contracting officer will normally limit the institution's share to no more than 10 percent of the project's cost.
              (c) Implementation. Cost-sharing shall be stated as a minimum percentage of the total allowable costs of the project. The contractor's contributed costs may not be charged to the Government under any other contract or grant, including allocation to other contracts and grants as part of an independent research and development program.

              (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause substantially as stated at 1852.216-74, Estimated Cost and Fixed Fee, in cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.
              (c) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-75, Payment of Fixed Fee, in cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. 
              (d) The contracting officer may insert the clause at 1852.216-81, Estimated Cost, in cost-no-fee contracts that are not cost sharing or facilities contracts.
              (e) [Reserved]
              (f) When FAR clause 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment, is included in the contract, as prescribed at FAR 16.307(a), the contracting officer should include the clause at 1852.216-89, Assignment and Release Forms.
              (g) As required by section 827 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112-239), use the clause at 1852.216-90, Allowability of Costs Incurred in Connection With a Whistleblower Proceeding—

              (2) In contracts awarded before September 30, 2013, that—
              (i) Include the clause at FAR 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment; and

              1816.402
              Application of predetermined, formula-type incentives. (NASA paragraphs 1, 2 and 3).
              When considering the use of a quality, performance, or schedule incentive, the following guidance applies:
              (1) A positive incentive is generally not appropriate unless—
              (i) Performance above the target (or minimum, if there are no negative incentives) level is of significant value to the Government;
              (ii) The value of the higher level of performance is worth the additional cost/fee;
              (iii) The attainment of the higher level of performance is clearly within the control of the contractor; and
              (iv) An upper limit is identified, beyond which no further incentive is earned.
              (2) A negative incentive is generally not appropriate unless—
              (i) A target level of performance can be established, which the contractor can reasonably be expected to reach with a diligent effort, but a lower level of performance is also minimally acceptable;
              (ii) The value of the negative incentive is commensurate with the lower level of performance and any additional administrative costs; and
              (iii) Factors likely to prevent attainment of the target level of performance are clearly within the control of the contractor.
              (3) When a negative incentive is used, the contract must indicate a level below which performance is not acceptable.

              1816.402-270
              NASA technical performance incentives.

              (a) Pursuant to the guidelines in 1816.402, NASA has determined that a performance incentive shall be included in all contracts that are based on performance-oriented documents (see FAR 11.101(a)), except those awarded under the commercial item procedures of FAR Part 12, where the primary deliverable(s) is (are) hardware with a total value (including options) greater than $25 million. Any exception to this requirement shall be approved in writing by the head of the contracting activity. Performance incentives may be included in supply and service contracts valued under $25 million, acquired under procedures other than Part 12, at the discretion of the contracting officer upon consideration of the guidelines in 1816.402. Performance incentives, which are objective and measure performance after delivery and acceptance, are separate from other incentives, such as cost or delivery incentives.

              (b) When a performance incentive is used, it shall be structured to be both positive and negative based on performance after acceptance, unless the contract type requires complete contractor liability for product performance (e.g., fixed price). In this latter case, a negative incentive is not required. In structuring the incentives, the contract shall establish a standard level of performance based on the salient performance requirement. This standard performance level is normally the contract's target level of performance. No performance incentive amount is earned at this standard performance level. Discrete units of measurement based on the same performance parameter shall be identified for performance above and, when a negative incentive is used, below the standard. Specific incentive amounts shall be associated with each performance level from maximum beneficial performance (maximum positive incentive) to, when a negative incentive is included, minimal beneficial performance or total failure (maximum negative incentive). The relationship between any given incentive, either positive or negative, and its associated unit of measurement should reflect the value to the Government of that level of performance. The contractor should not be rewarded for above-standard performance levels that are of no benefit to the Government.
              (c) The final calculation of the performance incentive shall be done when performance, as defined in the contract, ceases or when the maximum positive incentive is reached. When performance ceases below the standard established in the contract and a negative incentive is included, the Government shall calculate the amount due and the contractor shall pay the Government that amount. Once performance exceeds the standard, the contractor may request payment of the incentive amount associated with a given level of performance, provided that such payments shall not be more frequent than monthly. When performance ceases above the standard level of performance, or when the maximum positive incentive is reached, the Government shall calculate the final performance incentive earned and unpaid and promptly remit it to the contractor.

              (d) When the deliverable supply or service lends itself to multiple, meaningful measures of performance, multiple performance incentives may be established. When the contract requires the sequential delivery of several items (e.g., multiple spacecraft), separate performance incentive structures may be established to parallel the sequential delivery and use of the deliverables.
              (e) In determining the value of the maximum performance incentives available, the contracting officer shall follow the following rules:
              (1) For a CPFF contract, the sum of the maximum positive performance incentive and fixed fee shall not exceed the limitations in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i).
              (2) For an award fee contract.
              (i) The individual values of the maximum positive performance incentive and the total potential award fee (including any base fee) shall each be at least one-third of the total potential contract fee. The remaining one-third of the total potential contract fee may be divided between award fee and the maximum performance incentive at the discretion of the contracting officer.

              (ii) The maximum negative performance incentive for research and development hardware (e.g., the first and second units) shall be equal in amount to the total earned award fee (including any base fee). The maximum negative performance incentives for production hardware (e.g., the third and all subsequent units of any hardware items) shall be equal in amount to the total potential award fee (including any base fee). Where one contract contains both cases described above, any base fee shall be allocated reasonably among the items.
              (3) For cost reimbursement contracts other than award fee contracts, the maximum negative performance incentives shall not exceed the total earned fee under the contract.

              (a) In addition to the items identified in FAR 16.401(e)(1), D&Fs will include a discussion of the other types of contracts considered and shall indicate why an award fee incentive is the appropriate choice. Award fee incentives should not be used on contracts with a total estimated cost and fee less than $2 million per year. Use of award fee incentive for lower-valued acquisitions may be authorized in exceptional situations such as contract requirements having direct health or safety impacts, where the judgmental assessment of the quality of contractor performance is critical.

              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an award fee incentive may be used in conjunction with other contract types for aspects of performance that cannot be objectively assessed. In such cases, the cost incentive is based on objective formulas inherent in the other contract types (e.g., FPI, CPIF), and the award fee provision should not separately incentivize cost performance.
              (c) Award fee incentives shall not be used with a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract.

              1816.405-271
              Base fee.

              (a) A base fee shall not be used on CPAF contracts for which the periodic award fee evaluations are final (1816.405-273(a)). In these circumstances, contractor performance during any award fee period is independent of and has no effect on subsequent performance periods or the final results at contract completion. For other contracts, such as those for hardware or software development, the procurement officer may authorize the use of a base fee not to exceed 3 percent. Base fee shall not be used when an award fee incentive is used in conjunction with another contract type (e.g., CPIF/AF).

              (b) When a base fee is authorized for use in a CPAF contract, it shall be paid only if the final award fee evaluation is “satisfactory” or better. (See 1816.405-273 and 1816.405-275) Pending final evaluation, base fee may be paid during the life of the contract at defined intervals on a provisional basis. If the final award fee evaluation is “unsatisfactory”, all provisional base fee payments shall be refunded to the Government.

              1816.405-272
              Award fee evaluation periods.

              (a) Award fee evaluation periods, including those for interim evaluations, should be at least 6 months in length. When appropriate, the procurement officer may authorize shorter evaluation periods after ensuring that the additional administrative costs associated with the shorter periods are offset by benefits accruing to the Government. Where practicable, such as developmental contracts with defined performance milestones (e.g., Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review, initial system test), establishing evaluation periods at conclusion of the milestones rather than calendar dates, or in combination with calendar dates should be considered. In no case shall an evaluation period be longer than 12 months.
              (b) A portion of the total available award fee contract shall be allocated to each of the evaluation periods. This allocation may result in an equal or unequal distribution of fee among the periods. The contracting officer shall consider the nature of each contract and the incentive effects of fee distribution in determining the appropriate allocation structure.

              1816.405-273
              Award fee evaluations.
              (a) Service contracts. On contracts where the contract deliverable is the performance of a service over any given time period, contractor performance is definitively measurable within each evaluation period. In these cases, all evaluations are final, and the contractor keeps the fee earned in any period regardless of the evaluations of subsequent periods. Unearned award fee in any given period in a service contract is lost and shall not be carried forward, or “rolled-over,” into subsequent periods.
              (b) End item contracts. On contracts, such as those for end item deliverables, where the true quality of contractor performance cannot be measured until the end of the contract, only the last evaluation is final. At that point, the total contract award fee pool is available, and the contractor's total performance is evaluated against the award fee plan to determine total earned award fee. In addition to the final evaluation, interim evaluations are done to monitor performance prior to contract completion, provide feedback to the contractor on the Government's assessment of the quality of its performance, and establish the basis for making interim award fee payments (see 1816.405-276(a)). These interim evaluations and associated interim award fee payments are superseded by the fee determination made in the final evaluation at contract completion. However, if the final award fee adjectival rating is higher or lower than the average adjectival rating of all the interim award fee periods, or if the final award fee score is eight base percentage points higher or lower than the average award fee score of all interim award fee periods (e.g. 80% to 88%), then the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) or the Deputy Chief Acquisition Officer (if the HCA is the Fee Determination Official) shall review and concur in the final award fee determination. The Government will then pay the contractor, or the contractor will refund to the Government, the difference between the final award fee determination and the cumulative interim fee payments.
              (c) Control of evaluations. Interim and final evaluations may be used to provide past performance information during the source selection process in future acquisitions and should be marked and controlled as “Source Selection Information—see FAR 3.104”. See FAR 42.1503(h) regarding the requirements for releasing Source Selection Information included in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).

              Award fee evaluation factors.
              (a) Explicit evaluation factors shall be established for each award fee period. Factors shall be linked to acquisition objectives which shall be defined in terms of contract cost, schedule, and technical performance. If used, subfactors should be limited to the minimum necessary to ensure a thorough evaluation and an effective incentive.

              (b) Evaluation factors will be developed by the contracting officer based upon the characteristics of an individual procurement. Cost control, schedule, and technical performance considerations shall be included as evaluation factors in all CPAF contracts, as applicable. When explicit evaluation factor weightings are used, cost control shall be no less than 25 percent of the total weighted evaluation factors. The predominant consideration of the cost control evaluation should be a measurement of the contractor's performance against the negotiated estimated cost of the contract. This estimated cost may include the value of undefinitized change orders when appropriate.
              (c)(1) The technical factor must include consideration of risk management (including mission success, safety, security, health, export control, and damage to the environment, as appropriate) unless waived at a level above the contracting officer, with the concurrence of the project manager. The rationale for any waiver shall be documented in the contract file. When safety, export control, or security are considered under the technical factor, the award fee plan shall allow the following fee determinations, regardless of contractor performance in other evaluation factors, when there is a major breach of safety or security.
              (i) For evaluation of service contracts under 1816.405-273(a), an overall fee rating of unsatisfactory for any evaluation period in which there is a major breach of safety or security.
              (ii) For evaluation of end item contracts under 1816.405-273(b), an overall fee rating of unsatisfactory for any interim evaluation period in which there is a major breach of safety or security. To ensure that the final award fee evaluation at contract completion reflects any major breach of safety or security, in an interim period, the overall award fee pool shall be reduced by the amount of the fee available for the period in which the major breach occurred if an unsatisfactory fee rating was assigned because of a major breach of safety or security.
              (2) A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any “willful” or “repeat” violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.
              (3) A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be directly related to the work on the contract. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the contractor that results in compromise of classified information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.
              (4) The Assistant Administrator for Procurement shall be notified prior to the determination of an unsatisfactory award fee rating because of a major breach of safety or security.
              (d) In rare circumstances, contract costs may increase for reasons outside the contractor's control and for which the contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment. One example is a weather-related launch delay on a launch support contract. The Government shall take such situations into consideration when evaluating contractor cost control.
              (e) Emphasis on cost control should be balanced against other performance requirement objectives. The contractor should not be incentivized to pursue cost control to the point that overall performance is significantly degraded. For example, incentivizing an underrun that results in direct negative impacts on technical performance, safety, or other critical contract objectives is both undesirable and counterproductive. Therefore, evaluation of cost control shall conform to the following guidelines:

              (1) Normally, the contractor should be given an unsatisfactory rating for cost control when there is a significant overrun within its control. However, the contractor may receive a satisfactory or higher rating for cost control if the overrun is insignificant. Award fee ratings should decrease sharply as the size of the overrun increases. In any evaluation of contractor overrun performance, the Government shall consider the reasons for the overrun and assess the extent and effectiveness of the contractor's efforts to control or mitigate the overrun.

              (2) The contractor should normally be rewarded for an underrun within its control, up to the maximum award fee rating allocated for cost control, provided the adjectival rating for all other award fee evaluation factors is very good or higher (see FAR 16.401(e)(iv)).
              (3) The contractor should be rewarded for meeting the estimated cost of the contract, but not to the maximum rating allocated for cost control, to the degree that the contractor has prudently managed costs while meeting contract requirements. No award fee shall be given in this circumstance unless the average adjectival rating for all other award fee evaluation factors is satisfactory or higher.

              (f) When an AF arrangement is used in conjunction with another contract type, the award fee's cost control factor will only apply to a subjective assessment of the contractor's efforts to control costs and not the actual cost outcome incentivized under the basic contract type (e.g. CPIF, FPIF).
              (g)(1) The contractor's performance against the subcontracting plan incorporated in the contract shall be evaluated. Emphasis may be placed on the contractor's accomplishment of its goals for subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities—Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs). The evaluation should consider both goals as a percentage of subcontracting dollars as well as a percentage of the total contract value.
              (2) The contractor's achievements in subcontracting high technology efforts as well as the contractor's performance under the Mentor-Protégé Program, if applicable, may also be evaluated.
              (3) The evaluation weight given to the contractor's performance against the considerations in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section shall be 10 percent of available award fee and shall be separate from all other factors.
              (h) When contract changes are anticipated, the contractor's responsiveness to requests for change proposals should be evaluated. This evaluation should include the contractor's submission of timely, complete proposals and cooperation in negotiating the change.
              (i) Only the award fee performance evaluation factors set forth in the performance evaluation plan shall be used to determine award fee scores.
              (j) The Government may unilaterally modify the applicable award fee performance evaluation factors and performance evaluation areas prior to the start of an evaluation period. The contracting officer shall notify the contractor in writing of any such changes 30 days prior to the start of the relevant evaluation period.

              Award fee evaluation rating.
              (a) All award fee contracts shall utilize the adjectival rating categories and associated descriptions as well as the award fee pool available to be earned percentages for each adjectival rating category contained in FAR 16.401(e)(3)(iv). Contracting officers may supplement these descriptions with more specifics relative to their procurement but they cannot alter or delete the FAR adjectival rating descriptions.
              (b) The following numerical scoring system shall be used in conjunction with the FAR adjectival rating categories and associated descriptions (see FAR 16401(e)(3)(iv)).
              (1) Excellent (100-91)
              (2) Very good (90-76)
              (3) Good (75-51)
              (4) Satisfactory (50)
              (5) Unsatisfactory (less than 50) No award fee shall be paid for an unsatisfactory rating.
              (c) As a benchmark for evaluation, in order to be rated “Excellent” overall, the contractor would typically be under cost, on or ahead of schedule, and providing outstanding technical performance.

              (d) A weighted scoring system appropriate for the circumstances of the individual contract requirement should be developed. In this system, each evaluation factor (e.g., technical, schedule, cost control) is assigned a specific percentage weighting with the cumulative weightings of all factors totaling 100. During the award fee evaluation, each factor is scored from 0-100 according to the ratings defined in 1816.405-275(b). The numerical score for each factor is then multiplied by the weighting for that factor to determine the weighted score. For example, if the technical factor has a weighting of 60 percent and the numerical score for that factor is 80, the weighted technical score is 48 (80 × 60 percent). The weighted scores for each evaluation factor are then added to determine the total award fee score.

              Award fee payments and limitations.
              (a) Interim award fee payments. The amount of an interim award fee payment (see 1816.405-273(b)) is limited to the lesser of the interim evaluation score or 80 percent of the fee allocated to that interim period less any provisional payments (see paragraph (b) of this subsection) made during the period.
              (b) Provisional award fee payments. Provisional award fee payments are payments made within evaluation periods prior to an interim or final evaluation for that period. Provisional payments may be included in the contract and should be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. For a service contract, the total amount of award fee available in an evaluation period that may be provisionally paid is the lesser of a percentage stipulated in the contract (but not exceeding 80 percent) or the prior period's evaluation score. For an end item contract, the total amount of provisional payments in a period is limited to a percentage not to exceed 80 percent of the prior interim period's evaluation score, except for the first evaluation period which is limited to 80 percent of the available award fee for that evaluation period.
              (c) Fee payment. The Fee Determination Official's rating for both interim and final evaluations will be provided to the contractor within 45 calendar days of the end of the period being evaluated. Any fee, interim or final, due the contractor will be paid no later than 60 calendar days after the end of the period being evaluated.

              1816.405-277
              Award term.
              (a) An award term enables a contractor to become eligible for additional periods of performance or ordering periods under a service contract (as defined in FAR 37.101) by achieving and sustaining the prescribed performance levels under the contract. It incentivizes the contractor for maintaining superior performance by providing an opportunity for extensions of the contract term.
              (b) Award terms are best suited for acquisitions where a longer term relationship (generally more than five years) between the Government and a contractor would provide significant benefits to both. Motivating excellent performance, fostering contractor capital investment, and increasing the desirability of the award, thus potentially increasing competition, are benefits that may justify the use of award terms.
              (c) While the administrative burden and cost of more frequent procurements to both the Government and potential offerors should be considered when determining whether to use award terms, this decision must be weighed against market stability, the potential changes and advancements in technology, and flexibility to change direction with mission changes and associated frequent procurements.

              (d) Award terms may be used in conjunction with contract options under FAR 17.2. Award terms are similar to contract options in that they are conditioned on the Government's continuing need for the contract and the availability of funds. However, FAR 17.207(c)(7) states the contracting officer must determine that the contractor's performance has been acceptable, e.g., received satisfactory ratings. In contrast, to become eligible for an award term, the contractor must maintain a level of performance above acceptable as specified in the Award Term Plan (see 1816.405-277(i)). In contracts with both option periods and award terms, the award term period of performance or ordering period shall begin after completion of any option period of performance or ordering period.
              (e) Contracts with award terms shall include a base period of performance or ordering period and may include a designated number of option periods during which the Government will observe and evaluate the contractor's performance allowing the contractor to earn an award term. Additionally, as specified in the Award Term Plan, the contractor may also be evaluated for additional award terms during performance of an earned award term. If the contractor meets or exceeds the performance requirements, there is an on-going need for and desire to continue the contract, funds are available, and the contractor is not listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions, then the contractor may be eligible for contract extension for the period of the award term.
              (f) Contracts with award terms shall comply with FAR and NFS restrictions on the overall contract length, such as the 5-year period of performance limitation found at NFS 1817.204.
              (g) Award terms may only be used in acquisitions for services exceeding $20 million dollars. Use of award terms for lower-valued acquisitions may be authorized in exceptional situations such as contract requirements having direct health or safety impacts, where the judgmental assessment of the quality of contractor performance is critical.
              (h) Consistent with the Competition in Contracting Act and general procurement principles, the potential award term periods in a procurement must be priced, evaluated, and considered in the initial contract selection process in order to be valid.
              (i) All contracts including award terms shall be supported by an Award Term Plan that establishes criteria for earning an award term and the methodology and schedule for evaluating contractor performance. A copy of the Award Term Plan shall be included in the contract. The contracting officer may unilaterally revise the Award Term Plan. Award Term Plans shall—
              (1) Identify the officials to include Term-Determining Official involved in the award term evaluation and their function;
              (2) Identify and describe each evaluation factor, any subfactors, related performance standards, adjectival ratings, and numerical ranges or weights to be used. The contracting officer should follow the guidance at 1816.405-274 in establishing award term evaluation factors and 1816.405-275 in establishing adjectival rating categories, associated descriptions, numerical scoring system, and weighted scoring system;
              (3) Specify the annual overall rating required for the contractor to be eligible for an award term that reflects a level of performance above acceptable and the number of award terms the contractor may qualify for based on the rating score;

              (4) Identify the evaluation period(s) and the evaluation schedule to be conducted at stated intervals during the contract period of performance or ordering period so that the contractor will periodically be informed of the quality of its performance and the areas in which improvement is expected (e.g., six months, nine months, twelve months, or at other specific milestones), and when the decision points are for the determination that the contractor is eligible for an award term; and
              (5) Identify the contract's base period of performance or ordering period, any option period(s), and total award-term periods(s). Award term periods shall not exceed one year.
              (j)(1) The Government has the unilateral right not to grant or to cancel award term periods and the associated Award Term Plans if—
              (i) The contractor has failed to achieve the required performance measures for the corresponding evaluation period;
              (ii) After earning an award term, the contractor fails to earn an award term in any succeeding year of contract performance, the contracting officer may cancel any award terms that the contractor has earned, but that have not begun;

              (iii) The contracting officer notifies the contractor that the Government no longer has a need for the award term period before the time an award term period is to begin;
              
              (iv) The contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of the contract, the contract was set-aside for small businesses, and the contractor rerepresents in accordance with FAR clause 52.219-28 Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, that it is no longer a small business; or
              (v) The contracting officer notifies the contractor that funds are not available for the award term.
              (2) When an award term period is not granted or cancelled, any—
              (i) Prior award term periods for which the contractor remains otherwise eligible are unaffected.
              (ii) Subsequent award term periods are also cancelled.
              (k) Cancellation of an award term period that has not yet commenced for any of the reasons set forth in paragraph (j) of this section shall not be considered either a termination for convenience or termination for default, and shall not entitle the contractor to any termination settlement or any other compensation. If the award term is cancelled, a unilateral modification will cite the clause as the authority.

The initial phase contracts are awarded, and the contractors for subsequent phases are expected to be chosen through a down-selection from among the preceding phase contractors. In each phase, progressively fewer contracts are awarded until a single contractor is chosen for the final phase. Normally, all down-selections are accomplished without issuance of a new, formal solicitation.

              (a)(i) NASA is committed to providing to small, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns, maximum practicable opportunities to participate in Agency acquisitions at the prime contract level. The participation of NASA prime contractors in providing subcontracting opportunities to such entities is also an essential part of the Agency's commitment. The participation of these entities is emphasized in high-technology areas where they have had low involvement level.
              (ii) NASA biennially negotiates Agency small business prime and subcontracting goals with the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 15(g) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644). In addition, NASA has an annual goal of five percent for prime and subcontract awards to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs), and a three percent goal for HUBZone and service-disabled, veteran-owned small business concerns.

              Scope of subpart.
              (a) This subpart implements the NASA Mentor-Protégé Program (hereafter referred to as the Program) established under the authority of Title 42, U.S.C., 2473(c)(1). The purpose of the Program is to:
              (1) Provide incentives to NASA contractors, performing under at least one active, approved subcontracting plan negotiated with NASA, to assist protégés in enhancing their capabilities to perform as viable NASA contractors, other Government contractors, and commercial suppliers on contract and subcontract requirements.
              (2) Increase the overall participation of protégés as subcontractors and suppliers under NASA contracts, other Federal agency contracts, and commercial contracts; and
              (3) Foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between protégés and mentors.
              (b) Under the Program, eligible entities approved as mentors will enter into mentor-protégé agreements with eligible protégés to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protégés to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. NASA may provide the mentor award fee incentives. Additionally, this subpart explains the calculated subcontracting credit for a mentor-protégé program pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

              Eligibility.
              (a) Eligibility of Mentors: To be eligible as a mentor, an entity must be—
              (1) A large prime contractor performing with at least one approved subcontracting plan, other than a commercial plan, negotiated with NASA, pursuant to FAR Subpart 19.7, the Small Business Subcontracting Program. A contractor may apply to become a mentor if they currently are not performing under a NASA contract as long as they are currently performing another Federal agency contract with an approved subcontracting plan. The NASA mentor-protégé agreement, however, will not be approved until the mentor company is performing under a NASA contract with an approved subcontracting plan; and
              (2) Eligible for receipt of Government contracts. An entity will not be approved for participation in the Program if, at the time of submission of the application to the Headquarters Office of Small Business Programs, the entity is currently debarred or suspended from contracting with the Federal Government pursuant to FAR Subpart 9.4, Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility.
              (b) Eligibility of Protégés: To be eligible to participate as a protégé, an entity must be—
              (1) Classified as a Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), a small disadvantaged business, a women-owned small business, a historically underutilized business zone concern, a veteran-owned, service-disabled small business, a historically black college and university, or a minority institution. The protégé entity may also be an active NASA SBIR/STTR Phase II company, or an entity participating in the AbilityOne program.
              (2) Eligible for the award of Federal contracts; and
              (3) A small business according to the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that represents the contemplated supplies or services to be provided by the protégé to the mentor.
              (c) A protégé firm may self-certify to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Mentors may rely in good faith on written representations by potential protégés that they meet the specified eligibility requirements.

              (4) Additional information as may be requested by the NASA OSBP; and
              (5) A signed letter of endorsement of the agreement by the contracting officer and the contracting officer representative.
              (b) The mentor-protégé agreement must be approved by the Assistant Administrator, NASA OSBP, prior to the mentor incurring eligible costs for developmental assistance provided to the protégé.
              (c) The cognizant NASA center will issue a contract modification, if justified, prior to the mentor incurring costs for developmental assistance to the protégé.

              Award Fee Pilot Program.

              (a) Mentors will be eligible to earn a separate award fee associated with the provision of developmental assistance to NASA SBIR/STTR Phase II Protégés only. The award fee will be assessed at the end of the Mentor-Protégé agreement period.
              (b) The overall developmental assistance performance of NASA contractors, in promoting the use of small businesses as subcontractors, will be a required evaluation factor in award fee plans.
              (c) Evaluation criteria to determine the award fee should include:
              (1) Benefit of the agreement to NASA;
              (2) Active participation in the Program;
              (3) The amount and quality of developmental assistance provided;
              (4) Subcontracts awarded to small businesses and others;
              (5) Success of the protégés in increasing their business as a result of receiving developmental assistance; and
              (6) Accomplishment of any other activity as related to the mentor-protégé relationship.
              (d) The Award Fee Pilot Program is an addition to the credit agreement. Participants that are eligible for award fee may also receive credit under their individual contract's award fee plan.

              Scope of subpart.

              The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs were established and issued under the authority of the Small Business Act codified at 15 U.S.C. 631, as amended, and the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-219), codified with amendments at 15 U.S.C. 638, as amended. The Small Business Act requires that the Small Business Administration (SBA) issue SBIR and STTR Program Policy Directives for the general conduct of the SBIR/STTR Programs within the Federal Government. The statutory purpose of the SBIR Program is to strengthen the role of innovative small business concerns (SBCs) in federally-funded research or research and development (R/R&D). Specific program purposes are to: Stimulate technological innovation; use small business to meet Federal R/R&D needs; foster and encourage participation by socially and economically disadvantaged SBCs, and by SBCs that are 51-percent owned and controlled by women, in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from Federal R/R&D, thereby increasing competition, productivity and economic growth. Federal agencies participating in the SBIR/STTR Programs (SBIR/STTR agencies) are obligated to follow the guidance provided by the SBA Policy Directive. NASA is required to ensure its policies, regulations, and guidance on the SBIR/STTR Programs are consistent with SBA's Policy Directive. Contracting officers are required to insert the applicable clauses identified in 1819.7302 in all SBIR and STTR contracts.

                Employee in a sensitive position means a contractor or subcontractor employee who has been granted access to classified information; a contractor or subcontractor employee in other positions that the contractor or subcontractor determines could reasonably be expected to affect safety, security, National security, or functions other than the foregoing requiring a high degree of trust and confidence; and includes any employee performing in a position designated “mission critical” or performing mission-critical duties. The term also includes any applicant who is tentatively selected for a position described in this paragraph.
              
              
                Mission Critical Space Systems means the collection of all space-based and ground-based systems used to conduct space missions or support activity in space, including, but not limited to, the crewed space system, space-based communication and navigation systems, launch systems, and mission/launch control.
              
                Mission Critical Positions/Duties means positions or duties which, if performed in a faulty, negligent, or malicious manner, could jeopardize mission critical space systems and/or delay a mission.
              
                Use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of alcohol includes having, while on duty or during a preemployment interview, an alcohol concentration of 0.04 percent by weight or more in the blood, as measured by chemical test of the individual's breath or blood. An individual's refusal to submit to such test is presumptive evidence of use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of alcohol.

Causes for suspension of contract payments, termination of the contract for default, and debarment and suspension of the contractor are the following:
              (a) The contractor fails to comply with paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of the clause at 1852.223-74; or
              (b) Such a number of contractor employees in sensitive positions having been convicted of violations of criminal drug statutes or substantial evidence of drug or alcohol abuse or misuse occurring in the workplace, as to indicate that the contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug- and alcohol-free workforce.

              (b) The clause prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section may be excluded with the approval of the installation official(s) responsible for matters of safety and occupational health.
              (c) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.223-73, Safety and Health Plan, in solicitations above the simplified acquisition threshold when the work will be conducted completely or partly on a Federally-controlled facility and the safety and health plan will be evaluated in source selection as approved by the source selection authority. This provision may be modified to identify specific information that is to be included in the plan. After receiving the concurrence of the center safety and occupational health official(s), the contracting officer shall incorporate the plan as an attachment into any resulting contract. The contracting officer shall insert the provision, with its Alternate I, in Invitations for Bid.

              (d)(1) The contracting officer shall insert FAR clause at 52.236-13 with its Alternate I in solicitations and contracts when the work will be conducted completely or partly on a Federally-controlled facility and a Safety and Health Plan will be reviewed after award as a contract deliverable. The contracting officer may modify the wording in paragraph (f) of Alternate I to specify:
              (i) When the proposed plan is due and
              (ii) Whether the contractor may commence work prior to approval of the plan; or
              (iii) To what extent the contractor may commence work before the plan is approved.
              (2) The requiring activity, in consultation with the cognizant health and safety official(s), will identify the data deliverable requirements for the safety and health plan. After receiving the concurrence of the center safety and occupational health official(s), the contracting officer shall incorporate the plan as an attachment into the contract.
              (e)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.223-75, Major Breach of Safety or Security, in all solicitations and contracts with estimated values of $500,000 or more, unless waived at a level above the contracting officer with the concurrence of the project manager and the installation official(s) responsible for matters of security, export control, safety, and occupational health.
              (2) Insert the clause with its Alternate I if—
              (i) The solicitation or contract is with an educational or other nonprofit institution and contains the termination clause at FAR 52.249-5; or
              (ii) The solicitation or contract is for commercial items and contains the clause at FAR 52.212-4.
              (3) For contracts with estimated values below $500,000, use of the clause is optional.
              (f) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.223-72, Safety and Health (Short Form) in solicitations and contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold when work will be conducted completely or partly on Federally-controlled facilities and that do not contain the clause at 1852.223-73 or the FAR clause at 52.236-13 with its Alternate I.

              Export control.
              (a) Background. (1) NASA contractors and subcontractors are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR parts 120 through 130, and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR parts 730 through 799. The contractor is responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals from the Department of State or the Department of Commerce when it exports hardware, technical data, or software, or provides technical assistance to a foreign destination or “foreign person”, as defined in 22 CFR 120.16, and there are no applicable or available exemptions/exceptions to the ITAR/EAR, respectively. A person who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States is not a “foreign person”. (See 22 CFR 120.16 and 15 CFR 734.2(b)(2)(ii))
              (2) The exemption at 22 CFR 125.4(b)(3) of the ITAR provides that a contractor may export technical data without a license if the contract between the agency and the exporter provides for the export of the data. The clause at 1852.225-70, Alternate I, provides contractual authority for the exemption, but the exemption is available only after the contracting officer, or designated representative, provides written authorization or direction enabling its use. It is NASA policy that the exemption at 22 CFR 125.4(b)(3) may only be used when technical data (including software) is exchanged with a NASA foreign partner pursuant to the terms of an international agreement in furtherance of an international collaborative effort. The contracting officer must obtain the approval of the Center Export Administrator before granting the contractor the authority to use this exemption.
              (b) Contract clause. Insert the clause at 1852.225-70, Export Licenses, in all solicitations and contracts, except in contracts with foreign entities. Insert the clause with its Alternate I when the NASA project office indicates that technical data (including software) is to be exchanged by the contractor with a NASA foreign partner pursuant to an international agreement.

              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart—
              
                Administrator means the Administrator of NASA or a duly authorized representative.
              
                Reportable item means any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation of the contractor, whether or not patentable or otherwise protectable under Title 35 of the United States Code, made in the performance of any work under any NASA contract or in the performance of any work that is reimbursable under any clause in any NASA contract providing for reimbursement of costs incurred before the effective date of the contract. Reportable items include, but are not limited to, new processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter, and improvements to, or new applications of, existing processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. Reportable items also include new computer programs, and improvements to, or new applications of, existing computer programs, whether or not copyrightable or otherwise protectable under Title 17 of the United States Code.
              
                Subject invention, in lieu of the definition in FAR 27.301, means any reportable item that is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under Title 35 of the United States Code, or any novel variety of plant that is or may be protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.).
            
            
              1827.302
              Policy.
              (a) Introduction. NASA policy with respect to any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation made in the performance of work under any NASA contract or subcontract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and the allocation of related property rights is based upon Section 20135 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20135) (the Act); and, to the extent consistent with this statute, the Presidential Memorandum on Government Patent Policy to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, dated February 18, 1983, and Section 1(b)(4) of Executive Order 12591. NASA contractors subject to Section 20135 of the Act shall ensure the prompt reporting of reportable items in order to protect the Government's interest and to provide the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination, early utilization, expeditious development, and continued availability for the benefit of the scientific, industrial, and commercial communities and the general public.
              (b) Contractor right to elect title. (1) For NASA contracts, the contractor right to elect title under the FAR only applies to contracts with small businesses and nonprofit organizations. For other business entities, see paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section;

              (2)(v) Under any NASA contract with other than a small business or nonprofit organization (i.e., contracts subject to section 20135(b) of the Act), title to subject inventions vests in NASA when the determinations of section 20135(b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)(B) have been made. The Administrator may grant the contractor a waiver of title in accordance with 14 CFR part 1245.
              (3) Contractor petitions for waiver of title. The Administrator may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or which may be made in the performance of NASA contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served. The procedures and instructions for contractors to submit petitions for waiver of rights in subject inventions are provided in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title14-vol5/pdf/CFR-2012-title14-vol5-part1245.pdf. Waiver may be requested in advance of contract award for any subject invention or class of subject inventions or during contract performance for individually identified subject inventions reported under the contract. For individual identified subject inventions, the petition shall identify each invention with particularity (e.g., by NASA's assigned number to the Disclosure of Invention and New Technology report or by title and inventorship). For advance waivers, the petition shall identify the invention or class of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver is being requested. To meet the statutory standard of “any invention or class of inventions,” the petition must be directed to a single invention or to inventions directed to a particular process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a narrowly-drawn, focused area of technology. When a waiver of title is granted, the contractor's right to title, the rights reserved by the Government, and other conditions and obligations of the waiver, such as requirements for reporting and filing patent applications on waived inventions, are provided in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.
              (c) Government license. For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, the Administrator shall reserve an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign Government in accordance with any treaty or agreement of the United States.
              (e) Utilization reports. For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, the requirements for utilization reports shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.
              (f) March-in rights. For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, march-in rights shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, and the Instrument of Waiver executed under those Regulations.
              (g) Preference for United States industry. For each subject invention made in the performance of work under a NASA contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and for which waiver of title has been granted, waiver of the requirement for substantial manufacture in the United States shall be in accordance with Title 35 of the United States Code, section 204.
              (i) Minimum rights to contractor. (1) For NASA contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization, where title to any subject inventions vests in NASA, the contractor is normally granted, in accordance with the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR 1245.108, a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country and in any resulting patent. The license extends to any of the contractor's domestic subsidiaries and affiliates within the corporate structure, and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license and right are transferable only with the approval of the Administrator, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
              (2) The procedures for revoking or modifying the license to a contractor that is other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization are described in 14 CFR 1245.108.
              (k) Awards. It is the policy of NASA to consider for a monetary award, when referred to the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board in accordance with 14 CFR part 1240, subpart 1, any subject invention reported to NASA in accordance with this subpart, and for which an application for patent has been filed.
            
            
              1827.303
              Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.
              (a)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.227-84, Patent Rights Clauses, in solicitations for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed in the United States when the eventual awardee may be a small business or a nonprofit organization.

              (7) The contracting officer shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel regarding the use of Alternate V in contracts for the performance of services at a NASA installation when a contractor is directed to fulfill the Government's obligations under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) authorized by 15 U.S.C. 3710a. Alternate V may be included in, or added to, the contract when it is contemplated that a Contractor will be directed to fulfill NASA's obligations under a CRADA, but should be added prior to the contractor performing work under the CRADA.

              (d)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.227-70, New Technology—Other than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization, in all NASA solicitations and contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization (i.e., those subject to section 21035(b) of the Act), if the contract is to be performed in the United States, and has as a purpose the performance of experimental, developmental, research, design, or engineering work. Contracts for any of the following purposes may be considered to involve the performance of work of the type described above (these examples are illustrative and not all inclusive):
              (i) Conduct of basic or applied research.

              (ii) Development, design, or manufacture for the first time of any machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter to satisfy NASA's specifications or special requirements.
              (iii) Development of any process or technique for attaining a NASA objective not readily attainable through the practice of a previously developed process or technique.
              (iv) Testing of, evaluation of, or experimentation with a machine, process, concept, or technique to determine whether it is suitable or could be made suitable for a NASA objective.
              (v) Construction work or architect-engineer services having as a purpose the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work or test and evaluation studies involving such work.
              (vi) The operation of facilities or the coordination and direction of the work of others, if these activities involve performing work of any of the types described in paragraphs (i) through (v) of this section.
              (2) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.227-71, Requests for Waiver of Rights to Inventions, in all solicitations that include the clause at 1852.227-70, New Technology—Other than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section).

              (3) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.227-72, Designation of New Technology Representative and Patent Representative, in all solicitations and contracts containing either of the clauses at FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Contractor, or 1852.227-70, New Technology—Other than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section). It may also be inserted, upon consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, in solicitations and contracts using another patent rights clause. The center New Technology and Patent Representatives are identified at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/portals/pl/new_tech_pocs.html.
              
              (e)(1) When work is to be performed outside the United States by contractors that are not domestic firms, the clause at 1852.227-85, Invention Reporting and Rights—Foreign, shall be used unless the contracting officer determines, with concurrence of the center patent or intellectual property counsel, that the objectives of the contract would be better served by use of the clause at FAR 52.227-13, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Government. For this purpose, the contracting officer may presume that a contractor is not a domestic firm unless it is known that the firm is not foreign owned, controlled, or influenced. (See FAR 27.304-3 regarding subcontracts with U.S. firms.)
              (2) When one of the conditions in FAR 27.303(e)(1)(i) through (iv) is met, the contracting officer shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel to determine the appropriate clause.

In any contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization and with respect to which advance waiver of rights has not been granted (see 1827.302(b)(3)), the contractor (or an employee-inventor of the contractor after consultation with the contractor) may request waiver of title to an individual identified subject invention pursuant to the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1.
              (d) Retention of rights by inventor. The NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, apply for any invention made in the performance of work under any contract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization.
              (f) Revocation or modification of contractor's minimum rights. For contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization, revocation or modification of the contractor's license rights in subject inventions made and reported under the contract shall be in accordance with 14 CFR 1245.108 (see 1827.302(i)(2)).
              (g) Exercise of march-in rights. For contracts with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization, the procedures for the exercise of march-in rights shall be as set forth in the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1.
              (h) Licenses and assignments under contracts with nonprofit organizations. The Headquarters Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property (ACIP) is the approval authority for assignments. Contractor requests should be made to the Patent Representative designated in the clause at 1852.227-72 and forwarded, with recommendation of the Patent Representative, to the ACIP for approval.
            
            
              1827.304-2
              Contracts placed by or for other Government agencies.
              (a)(3)(i) This subsection applies only to contracts placed by or for other agencies and not to task or delivery orders placed by or for other agencies against NASA Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) or Multiple Agency Contracts (MACs).
              (ii) When a contract is placed for another agency with a small business or nonprofit organization and the agency does not request the use of a specific patent rights clause, the contracting officer shall use the clause at FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Contractor as modified by 1852.227-11 (see 1827.303(b)(1)).
              (iii) When a contract is placed for another agency with other than a small business or nonprofit organization, the contracting officer, in accordance with Section 20135 of the Act, shall use the clause at 1852.227-70, New Technology—Other than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization (see 1827.303(d)(1).
              (iv) When work is to be performed outside the United States by contractors that are not domestic firms, the contracting officer shall use one of the clause described in 1827.303(e)(1).

              (a) Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the contracting officer, contractors awarding subcontracts at any tier shall select and include in the subcontracts one of the clauses identified in subparagraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section. At all tiers, the applicable clause identified below shall be modified to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and in all references to the Contractor the subcontractor is substituted for the Contractor so that the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause.
              (1) The clause at 1852.227-70, New Technology—Other than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization, shall be used in any subcontract with other than a small business firm or a nonprofit organization if a purpose of the subcontract is the performance of experimental, developmental, research, design, or engineering work of any of the types described in 1827.303(d)(1).
              (2) The clause at FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights—Ownership by the Contractor, modified by 1852.227-11 (see 1827.303(b)(1)), shall be used in any subcontract with a small business firm or a nonprofit organization if a purpose of the subcontract is the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work.

              Basic rights in data clause.
            
            
              1827.404-4
              Contractor's release, publication, and use of data.

              (b)(1) NASA's intent is to ensure the most expeditious dissemination of computer software developed by it or its contractor. Accordingly, when the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, is modified by 1852.227-14 (see 1827.409(b)(1)), the contractor shall not assert claim to copyright, publish, or release to others computer software first produced in the performance of a contract without the contracting officer's prior written permission. The prohibition on “release to others” does not prohibit release to another Federal Agency for its use or its contractors' use, as long as any such release is consistent with any restrictive markings on the software. Any restrictive markings on the software shall take precedence over the aforementioned release. Any such release to a Federal Agency in accordance with this paragraph shall limit use to the Federal Agency or its contractors for Government purposes only.
              (2) The contracting officer may, in consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, grant the contractor permission to assert claim to copyright, publish, or release to others computer software first produced in the performance of a contract if:
              (i) The contractor has identified an existing commercial computer software product line or proposes a new one and states a positive intention of incorporating identified computer software first produced under the contract into that line, either directly itself or through a licensee;
              (ii) The contractor has identified an existing open source software project or proposes a new one and states a positive intention of incorporating identified computer software first produced under the contract into that project, or has been instructed by the Agency to incorporate software first produced under the contract into an open source software project or otherwise release the software as open source software;
              (iii) The contractor has made, or will be required to make, substantial contributions to the development of the computer software by co-funding or by cost-sharing, or by contributing resources (including but not limited to agreement to provide continuing maintenance and update of the software at no cost for Governmental use); or
              (iv) The concurrence of the Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property, or designee, is obtained.
              (c)(1) The contractor's request for permission in accordance with 1827.404-4(b) may be made either before contract award or during contract performance.
              (2)(i) If the basis for permitting the assertion under 1827.404-4(b)(2) is subsection (i), then the permission shall be granted by a contract modification prepared by the contracting officer in consultation with the Center patent or intellectual property counsel that contains appropriate assurances that the computer software will be incorporated into an existing or proposed new commercial computer software product line within a specified reasonable time, with contingencies enabling the Government to obtain the right to distribute the software for commercial use, including the right to obtain assignment of copyright where applicable, in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or abandoned by the contractor.
              (ii) If the basis for permitting the assertion under 1827.404-4(b)(2) is paragraph (b)(2)(ii), then the permission shall be granted by a contract modification prepared by the contracting officer in consultation with the Center patent or intellectual property counsel that contains appropriate assurances that the computer software will be incorporated into an existing or proposed new open source project within a specified reasonable time, with contingencies enabling the Government to obtain the right to distribute the software for open source development, including the right to obtain assignment of copyright where applicable, in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or abandoned by the contractor.

              (iii) If the basis for permitting the assertion under 1827.404-4(b)(2) is paragraph (b)(2)(iii), then the permission shall be granted by a contract modification that contains appropriate assurances that the agreed contributions to the Government are fulfilled, with contingencies enabling the Government to obtain assignment of copyright if such contributions do not occur in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or abandoned by the contractor.
              (iv) If the basis for permitting the assertion under 1827.404-4(b)(2) is paragraph (b)(2)(iv), then the permission shall be granted by a contract modification prepared by the contracting officer in consultation with the Center patent or intellectual property counsel that contains appropriate assurances as required by the Agency Counsel for Intellectual Property, or designee, including at the very least the right to obtain assignment of copyright in order to prevent the computer software from being suppressed or abandoned by the contractor.

              (3) When any permission to copyright is granted, any copyright license retained by the Government shall be of the same scope as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14 and without any obligation of confidentiality on the part of the Government unless, in accordance with 1827.404-4(b)(2)(iii), the contributions of the Contractor are considered “substantial” for the purposes of FAR 27.408 (i.e., approximately 50 percent), in which case rights consistent with FAR 27.408 may be negotiated for the computer software in question.
              (d) If the contractor has not been granted permission to assert claim to copyright, paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General (as modified by 1852.227-14) enables NASA to direct the contractor to assert claim to copyright in computer software first produced under the contract and to assign, or obtain the assignment of, such copyright to the Government or its designated assignee. The contracting officer may, in consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, so direct the contractor in situations where copyright protection is considered necessary in furtherance of Agency mission objectives, needed to support specific Agency programs, or necessary to meet statutory requirements.

              Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.
              (b)(1) When the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, is included in a solicitation or contract, it shall be modified as set forth at 1852.227-14. In contracts for basic or applied research to be performed solely by universities and colleges, the contracting officer shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel regarding the addition of subparagraph (4) as set forth at 1852.227-14 to paragraph (d) of the clause at FAR 52.227-14 and they will consider the guidance provided at FAR 27.404-4.
              (2) The contracting officer, with the concurrence of the center patent or intellectual property counsel, is the approval authority for use of Alternate I of the clause at FAR 52.227-14. An example of its use is where the principal purpose of the contract (such as a contract for basic or applied research) does not involve the development, use, or delivery of items, components, or processes that are intended to be acquired for use by or for the Government (either under the contract in question or under any anticipated follow-on contracts relating to the same subject matter).
              (3) The contracting officer shall review the disclosure purposes listed in FAR 27.404-2(c)(1)(i) through (v) and, in consultation with the center patent or intellectual property counsel, determine which disclosure purposes apply based on the nature of the acquisition, and add them to paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General. If none apply, the CO shall insert “none”. Additions to those specific purposes listed may be made only with the approval of the procurement officer and concurrence of the center patent or intellectual property counsel.

              (4) The contracting officer shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel regarding the acquisition of restricted computer software with greater or lesser rights than those set forth in Alternate III of the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General. Where it is impractical to actually modify the notice of Alternate III, such greater or lesser rights may be indicated by express reference in a separate clause in the contract or by a collateral agreement that addresses the change in the restricted rights.
              
              (5) The contracting officer, with the concurrence of the center patent or intellectual property counsel, is the approval authority for the use of Alternate IV in any contract other than a contract for basic or applied research to be performed solely by a college or university (but not for the management or operation of Government facilities). See the guidance at FAR 27.404-3(a)(3).
              (d) The clause at 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, shall be used in all solicitations and contracts involving experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration work (other than basic or applied research to be performed under a contract solely by a university or college when the contract amount will be $500,000 or less), unless after consultation between the Contracting Officer and the center patent or intellectual property counsel a determination is made otherwise.
              (g) The contracting officer shall use the clause at 1852.227-86, Commercial Computer Software License, in lieu of FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software License, when it is considered appropriate for the acquisition of existing computer software.
              (h) Normally the clause at 52.227-20, Rights in Data—SBIR Program, is the only data rights clause used in SBIR contracts. However, if during the performance of an SBIR contract (Phase I, Phase II, or Phase III) the need arises for NASA to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software as defined in the clause at FAR 52.227-20, and the contractor agrees to such delivery, the limited rights data or restricted computer software may be acquired by modification of the contract (for example, by adding the clause at FAR 52.227-14 with any appropriate Alternates and making it applicable only to the limited rights data or restricted computer software to be delivered), using the rights and related restrictions as set forth in FAR 27.404-2 as a guide.
              (i) [Reserved]
              (k)(i) The contracting officer shall add paragraph (e) as set forth in 1852.227-19(a) to the clause at FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software License, when it is contemplated that updates, correction notices, consultation information, and other similar items of information relating to commercial computer software delivered under a purchase order or contract are available and their receipt can be facilitated by signing a vendor supplied agreement, registration forms, or cards and returning them directly to the vendor.
              (ii) The contracting officer shall add paragraph (f) as set forth at 1852.227-19(b) to the clause at FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software License, when portions of a contractor's standard commercial license or lease agreement consistent with the clause, Federal laws, standard industry practices, and the FAR are to be incorporated into the purchase order or contract.
              (m)(1) The contracting officer, shall consult with the center patent or intellectual property counsel and the installation software release authority to determine when to use the clause at 1852.227-88, Government-furnished computer software and related technical data.
              (2) The clause may be included in, or added to, the contract when it is contemplated that computer software and related technical data will be provided to the contractor as Government-furnished information for use in performing the contract.

              (c) The contracting officer must insert FAR clause 52.228-7 and the associated clause at 1852.228-81, Insurance—Partial Immunity From Tort Liability, when the successful offeror represents in its offer that the offeror is partially immune from tort liability as a State agency or as a charitable institution.
              (d) The contracting officer must insert the clause at 1852.228-82, Insurance—Total Immunity From Tort Liability, when the successful offeror represents in its offer that the offeror is totally immune from tort liability as a State agency or as a charitable institution.

              1828.370
              Fixed-price contract clauses.
              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-70, Aircraft Ground and Flight Risk, in all negotiated fixed-price contracts for the development, production, modification, maintenance, or overhaul of aircraft, or otherwise involving the furnishing of aircraft to the contractor, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the aircraft are covered by a separate bailment. See the clause preface for directions for modifying the clause to accommodate various circumstances.
              (b) The Government need not assume the risk of aircraft damage, loss, or destruction as provided by the clause at 1852.228-70 if the best estimate of premium costs that would be included in the contract price for insurance coverage for such damage, loss, or destruction at any plant or facility is less than $500. If it is determined not to assume this risk, the clause at 1852.228-70 shall not be made a part of the contract, and the cost of necessary insurance to be obtained by the contractor to cover this risk shall be considered in establishing the contract price. In such cases, however, if performance of the contract is expected to involve the flight of Government-furnished aircraft, the substance of the clause at 1852.228-71, Aircraft Flight Risks, suitably adapted for use in a fixed-price contract, shall be used.

              (c) When the clause at 1852.228-70 is used, the term “Contractor's premises” shall be expressly defined in the contract Schedule and shall be limited to places where aircraft may be located during the performance of the contract. Contractor's premises may include, but are not limited to, those owned or leased by the contractor or those for which the contractor has a permit, license, or other right of use either exclusively or jointly with others, including Government airfields.
            
            
              1828.371
              Clauses incorporating cross-waivers of liability for International Space Station activities and Science or Space Exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station.
              (a) In contracts covering International Space Station activities, or Science or Space Exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station that involve a launch, NASA shall require the contractor to agree to waive all claims against any entity or person defined in the clause based on damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waivers will require the contractor to extend the cross-waiver provisions to their subcontractors at any tier and related entities ensuring those subcontractors and related entities also waive all claims against any entity or person defined in the clause for damages arising out of Protected Space Operations. The purpose of the clauses prescribed in this section is to extend the cross-waivers under other agreements to NASA contractors that perform work in support of NASA's obligations under these agreements.
              (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-78, Cross-Waiver of Liability for Science or Space Exploration Activities unrelated to the International Space Station, in solicitations and contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold for the acquisition of launches for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station or for acquisitions for science or space exploration activities that are not related to the International Space Station but involve a launch. If a science or space exploration activity is in support of the International Space Station, the contracting officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section and designate its application to that particular launch.
              (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228-76, Cross-Waiver of Liability for International Space Station Activities, in solicitations and contracts above the simplified acquisition threshold when the work to be performed involves Protected Space Operations, as that term is defined in the clause, relating to the International Space Station.
              (d) At the contracting officer's discretion, the clauses prescribed by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be used in solicitations, contracts, new work modifications, or extensions to existing contracts under the simplified acquisition threshold involving science or space exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station, or International Space Station activities, respectively, in appropriate circumstances. Examples of such circumstances are when the value of contractor property on a Government installation used in performance of the contract is significant, or when it is likely that the contractor or subcontractor will have its valuable property exposed to risk or damage caused by other participants in the science or space exploration activities unrelated to the International Space Station, or International Space Station activities.

To determine the amount that qualifies as cost incurred, multiply the incurred portions of the overhead pool allocation bases by the latest available cost of money factors. These FCCOM calculations are interim estimates subject to adjustment.
              (2) As actual cost of money factors are finalized, use the new factors to calculate FCCOM for the next accounting period.

              Representative investment calculations.
              (a) The calculation of the representative investment requires consideration of the rate or expenditure pattern of the costs to construct, fabricate, or develop a capital asset.
              (b) If the majority of the costs were incurred toward the beginning, middle, or end of the cost accounting period, the contractor shall either:
              (1) Determine a representative investment for the cost accounting period by calculating the average of the month-end balances for that cost accounting period; or

              (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative investments.
              
              (c) If the costs were incurred in a fairly uniform expenditure pattern throughout the construction, fabrication, or development period, the contractor may either:
              (1) Determine a representative investment for the cost accounting period by averaging the beginning and ending balances of the construction, fabrication, or development cost account for the cost accounting period; or
              (2) Treat month-end balances as individual representative investments.
              (d) The method chosen by the contractor to determine the representative investment amount may be different for each capital asset being constructed, fabricated, or developed, provided the method fits the expenditure pattern of the costs incurred.
            
            
              1830.7002-4
              Determining imputed cost of money.
              (a) Determine the imputed cost of money for an asset under construction, fabrication, or development by applying a cost of money rate (see 1830.7002-2) to the representative investment (see 1830.7002-3).
              (1) When a representative investment is determined for a cost accounting period in accordance with 1830.7002-3(b)(1) or 1830.7002-3(c)(1), the cost of money rate shall be the time-weighted average rate.
              (2) When a monthly representative investment is used in accordance with 1830.7002-3(b)(2) or 1830.7002-3(c)(2), the cost of money rate shall be that in effect each month. Under this method, the FCCOM is determined monthly, and the total for the cost accounting period is the sum of the monthly calculations.
              (b) The imputed cost of money will be capitalized only once in any cost accounting period, either at the end of the accounting period or the end of the construction, fabrication, or development period, whichever comes first.
              (c) When the construction, fabrication, or development of an asset takes more than one accounting period, the cost of money capitalized for the first accounting period will be included in determining the representative investment for any future cost accounting periods.

              (d)(4) The provision at 1852.233-70 provides for an alternative to a protest to the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO). This alternative gives bidders or offerors the ability to protest directly to the contracting officer (CO) or to request an independent review by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (or designee). The Agency review shall be deemed to be at the CO level when the request is silent as to the level of review desired. The Agency review shall be deemed to be at the level of the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (or designee) when the request specifies a level above the CO, even if the request does not specifically request an independent review by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement. Such reviews are separate and distinct from the Ombudsman Program described at 1815.7001.
              (e) NASA shall summarily dismiss and take no further action upon any protest to the Agency if the substance of the protest is pending in judicial proceedings or the protester has filed a protest on the same acquisition with the GAO prior to receipt of an Agency protest decision.
              (4) When a bidder or offeror submits an Agency protest to the CO or alternatively requests an independent review by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement, the decision of the CO or the Assistant Administrator for Procurement shall be final and is not subject to any appeal or reconsideration within NASA.

              1834.201
              Policy.
              (a) NASA requires use of an Earned Value Management System (EVMS) on contracts for development or production work, including development or production work for flight and ground support systems and components, prototypes, and institutional investments (facilities, IT infrastructure, etc.) as specified below:
              (1) For cost or fixed-price incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $50 Million or more the contractor shall have an EVMS that has been determined by the cognizant Federal agency to be in compliance with the guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748).
              (2) For cost or fixed-price incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $20 Million or more but less than $50 Million, the contractor shall have an EVMS that complies with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748, as determined by the cognizant Contracting Officer.
              (3) For cost or fixed-price incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at less than $20 Million the application of Earned Value Management (EVM) is optional and is a risk-based decision at the discretion of the program/project manager.
              (b) Requiring EVM for firm-fixed-price (FFP) contracts and subcontracts of any dollar value is discouraged; however, an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) and adequate reporting shall be required to plan and track schedule performance for development or production contracts valued at $20 Million or more. In addition, for FFP contracts that are part of a program/project of $50 Million or more, the contracting officer shall collaborate with the government's program/project manager to ensure the appropriate data can be obtained or generated to fulfill program management needs and comply with NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 7120.5.
              (c) An EVMS is not required on non-developmental contracts for engineering support services, steady state operations, basic and applied research, and routine services such as janitorial services or grounds maintenance services.

              (d) Contracting officers shall request the assistance of the cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) office and the applicable NASA Center EVM Focal Point (http://evm.nasa.gov/council.html) in determining the adequacy of proposed EVMS plans and procedures and system compliance.
              (e) Notwithstanding the EVMS requirements above, if an offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the ANSI/EIA Standard-748, Earned Value Management Systems, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with these EVMS standards, as specified in 1852.234-1, Notice of Earned Value Management System. Offerors shall not be eliminated from consideration for contract award because they do not have an EVMS that complies with these standards.

              (f) As a minimum, and in accordance with NPD 7120.5, requirements initiators shall ensure that EVMS monthly reports are included as a deliverable in the acquisition package provided to the procurement office for implementation into contracts where EVMS applies. Additionally, the acquisition package shall include a Contract Performance Report (CPR), IMS and a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and the appropriate data requirements descriptions (DRDs) for implementation into the contract.

            Foreign participation under broad agency announcements (BAAs).
            (a) Policy. (1) NASA seeks the broadest participation in response to broad agency announcements, including foreign proposals or proposals including foreign participation. NASA's policy is to conduct research with foreign entities on a cooperative, no-exchange-of-funds basis (see NPD 1360.2, Initiation and Development of International Cooperation in Space and Aeronautics Programs). NASA does not normally fund foreign research proposals or foreign research efforts that are part of U.S. research proposals. Rather, cooperative research efforts are implemented via international agreements between NASA and the sponsoring foreign agency or funding/sponsoring institution under which the parties agree to each bear the cost of discharging their respective responsibilities.
            (2) In accordance with the National Space Transportation Policy, use of a non-U.S. manufactured launch vehicle is permitted only on a no-exchange-of-funds basis.
            (3) NASA funding may not be used for subcontracted foreign research efforts. The direct purchase of supplies and/or services, which do not constitute research, from non-U.S. sources by U.S. award recipients is permitted.

            NASA Research Announcements.

            (a) Scope. An NRA is used to announce research interests in support of NASA's programs, and, after peer or scientific review using factors in the NRA, select proposals for funding. Unlike an RFP containing a statement of work or specification to which offerors are to respond, an NRA provides for the submission of competitive project ideas, conceived by the offerors, in one or more program areas of interest. An NRA shall not be used when the requirement is sufficiently defined to specify an end product or service.

            (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.235-70, Center for AeroSpace Information, in all research and development contracts, and interagency agreements and cost-reimbursement supply contracts involving research and development work.
            (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.235-71, Key Personnel and Facilities, in contracts when source selection has been substantially predicated upon the possession by a given offeror of special capabilities, as represented by key personnel or facilities.
            (c) The contracting officer shall ensure that the provision at 1852.235-72, Instructions for Responding to NASA Research Announcements, is inserted in all NRAs. The instructions may be supplemented, but only to the minimum extent necessary.
            (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.235-73, Final Scientific and Technical Reports, in all research and development contracts, and in interagency agreements and cost-reimbursement supply contracts involving research and development work.
            (1) The contracting officer, after consultation with and concurrence of the program or project manager and the center Export Control Administrator, shall insert the clause with its Alternate I when the contract includes “fundamental research” as defined at 22 CFR 120.11(8) and no prior review of data, including the final report, produced during the performance of the contract is required for export control or national security purposes before the contractor may publish, release, or otherwise disseminate the data.
            (2) The contracting officer, after consultation with and concurrence by the program or project manager and where necessary the center Export Control Administrator, shall insert the clause with its Alternate II, when prior review of all data produced during the performance of the contract is required before the contractor may publish, release, or otherwise disseminate the data. For example, when data produced during performance of the contract may be subject to export control, national security restrictions, or other restrictions designated by NASA; or, to the extent the contractor receives or is given access to data that includes restrictive markings, may include proprietary information of others.
            (3) Except when Alternate II applies in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the contracting officer shall insert the clause with its Alternate III in all SBIR and STTR contracts.
            (e) The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 1852.235-74, Additional Reports of Work—Research and Development, in all research and development contracts, and in interagency agreements and cost-reimbursement supply contracts involving research and development work, when periodic reports, such as monthly or quarterly reports, or reports on the completion of significant units or phases of work are required for monitoring contract performance. The clause should be modified to reflect the reporting requirements of the contract and to indicate the timeframe for submission of the final report.

              (a) It is NASA's policy not to require pension portability in service contracts. However, pension portability requirements may be included in solicitations, contracts, or contract modifications for additional work under the following conditions:

              (1)(i) There is a continuing need for the same or similar services for a minimum of five years (inclusive of options), and, if the contractor changes, a high percentage of the predecessor contractor's employees are expected to remain with the program; or
              (ii) The employees under a predecessor contract were covered by a portable pension plan, a follow-on contract or a contract consolidating existing services is awarded, and the total contract period covered by the plan covers a minimum of five years (including both the predecessor and successor contracts); and
              (2) The procurement officer determines in writing, with full supporting rationale, that such a requirement is in the Government's best interest. The procurement officer shall maintain a record of all such determinations.
              (b) When pension portability is required, the plan shall comply with the requirements of the clause at 1852.237-71, Pension Portability, (see 1837.110-70(b)), and the contract shall also include a clear description of the plan, including service, pay, liabilities, vesting, termination, and benefits from prior contracts.

              Providing contractors access to sensitive information.
              (a)(1) As used in this subpart, “sensitive information” refers to information that the contractor has developed at private expense or that the Government has generated that qualifies for an exception to the Freedom of Information Act, which is not currently in the public domain, may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and may be sensitive or privileged, the disclosure of which is likely to have either of the following effects: To impair the Government's ability to obtain this type of information in the future; or to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained. The term is not intended to resemble the markings of national security documents as in sensitive-secret-top secret.
              (2) As used in this subpart, “requiring organization” refers to the NASA organizational element or activity that requires specified services to be provided.
              (3) As used in this subpart, “service provider” refers to the service contractor that receives sensitive information from NASA to provide services to the requiring organization.
              (b)(1) To support management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies on numerous service providers. These contractors may require access to sensitive information in the Government's possession, which may be entitled to protection from unauthorized use or disclosure.
              (2) As an initial step, the requiring organization shall identify when needed services may entail access to sensitive information and shall determine whether providing access is necessary for accomplishing the Agency's mission. The requiring organization shall review any service provider requests for access to information to determine whether the access is necessary and whether the information requested is considered “sensitive” as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (c) When the requiring organization determines that providing specified services will entail access to sensitive information, the solicitation shall require each potential service provider to submit with its proposal a preliminary analysis of possible organizational conflicts of interest that might flow from the award of a contract. After selection, or whenever it becomes clear that performance will necessitate access to sensitive information, the service provider must submit a comprehensive organizational conflicts of interest avoidance plan.

              (d) This comprehensive plan shall incorporate any previous studies performed, shall thoroughly analyze all organizational conflicts of interest that might arise because the service provider has access to other companies' sensitive information, and shall establish specific methods to control, mitigate, or eliminate all problems identified. The contracting officer, with advice from Center counsel, shall review the plan for completeness and identify to the service provider substantive weaknesses and omissions for necessary correction. Once the service provider has corrected the substantive weaknesses and omissions, the contracting officer shall incorporate the revised plan into the contract, as a compliance document.
              (e) If the service provider will be operating an information technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the operating contract shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources, which requires the implementation of an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use.
              (f) NASA will monitor performance to assure any service provider that requires access to sensitive information follows the steps outlined in the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information, to protect the information from unauthorized use or disclosure.

              Release of contractors' sensitive information.
              Pursuant to the clause at 1852.237-73, Release of Sensitive Information, offerors and contractors agree that NASA may release their sensitive information when requested by service providers in accordance with the procedures prescribed in 1837.203-70 and subject to the safeguards and protections delineated in the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. As required by the clause at 1852.237-73, or other contract clause or solicitation provision, contractors must identify information they claim to be “sensitive” submitted as part of a proposal or in the course of performing a contract. The contracting officer shall evaluate all contractor claims of sensitivity in deciding how NASA should respond to requests from service providers for access to information.

              Instructions for preparing NASA Form 1018.
              NASA must account for and report assets in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3512 and 31 U.S.C. 3515, Federal Accounting Standards, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructions. Since contractors maintain NASA's official records for its assets in their possession, NASA must obtain periodic data from those records to meet these requirements. Changes in Federal Accounting Standards and OMB reporting requirements may occur from year to year, requiring contractor submission of supplemental information with the NASA Form (NF) 1018. The specific Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) to be used for property records are SFFAS No. 3 “Accounting for Inventory and Related Property”, SFFAS No. 6 “Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment”, SFFAS No. 10 “Accounting for Internal Use Software”, and SFFAS No. 11 “Amendments to PP&E: Definitions” issued by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. Classifications of property, related costs to be reported, and other reporting requirements are discussed in this subpart. NF 1018 (see 1853.3) provides critical information for NASA financial statements and property management. Accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the report are critical to many aspects of NASA's operations.

              1845.7101-1
              Property classification.
              (a) General. (1) Contractors shall report costs in the classifications on NF 1018, as described in this section. The cost of heritage assets and obsolete property will be reported on the NF 1018 under the appropriate classification. Supplemental reporting may also be required.
              (2)(i) Heritage assets are property, plant and equipment that possess one or more of the following characteristics:
              (A) Historical or natural significance;
              
              (B) Cultural, educational or artistic importance; or
              (C) Significant architectural characteristics.
              (ii) Examples of NASA heritage assets include buildings and structures designated as National Historic Landmarks as well as aircraft, spacecraft and related components on display to enhance public understanding of NASA programs. Heritage assets which serve both a heritage and government operation function are considered multi-use when the predominant use is in general government operations. Multi-use heritage assets will not be considered heritage assets for NF 1018 supplemental reporting purposes.
              (3) Obsolete property is property for which there are no current plans for use in its intended purpose (i.e., it no longer provides service to NASA operations). Examples of obsolete property are items in configurations which are no longer required or used by NASA or items held for engineering evaluation purposes only. NASA may have approved the retention of these items for programmatic reasons even though they have no current plans for use.
              (b) Land. Includes costs of land and improvements to land. Contractors shall report land with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more.
              (c) Buildings. Includes costs of buildings, improvements to buildings, and fixed equipment required for the operation of a building which is permanently attached to and a part of the building and cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings, of floors. Contractors shall report buildings with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more. Examples of fixed equipment required for functioning of a building include plumbing, heating and lighting equipment, elevators, central air conditioning systems, and built-in safes and vaults.
              (d) Other Structures and Facilities. Includes costs of acquisitions and improvements of real property (i.e. structures and facilities other than buildings); for example, airfield pavements, harbor and port facilities, power production facilities and distribution systems, reclamation and irrigation facilities, flood control and navigation aids, utility systems (heating, sewage, water and electrical) when they serve several buildings or structures, communication systems, traffic aids, roads and bridges, railroads, monuments and memorials, and nonstructural improvements such as sidewalks, parking areas, and fences. Contractors shall report other structures and facilities with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more.
              (e) Leasehold improvements. Includes NASA-funded costs of improvements to leased buildings, structures, and facilities, as well as easements and right-of-way, where NASA is the lessee or the cost is charged to a NASA contract. Contractors shall report leasehold improvements with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more.
              (f) Construction in progress. Includes costs of work in process for the construction of Buildings, Other Structures and Facilities, and Leasehold Improvements to which NASA has title, regardless of value.
              (g) Equipment. Includes costs of commercially available personal property capable of stand-alone use in manufacturing supplies, performing services, or any general or administrative purpose (for example, machine tools, furniture, vehicles, computers, software, test equipment, including their accessory or auxiliary items). Software integrated into and necessary to operate another item of Government property is considered to be an auxiliary item (see FAR 45.501) and should be considered part of the item of which it is an integral part. Other software to which NASA has title shall be classified as an individual item of equipment for reporting purposes if it has a useful life of 2 years or more and acquisition cost of $1,000,000 or more (also see 1845.7101-3(g)). Enhancement costs for existing software should be added to the software acquisition cost if the enhancement results in significant additional capability beyond that for which the software was originally developed (i.e., a capability that was not included in the original software specifications, the total cost of the enhancement is $1,000,000 or more, or the expected useful life of the enhanced software is 2 years or more). Software licenses are excluded. Contractors shall separately report:
              (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and
              (2) All other items.
              (h) Special tooling. Includes costs of equipment and manufacturing aids (and their components and replacements) of such a specialized nature that, without substantial modification or alteration, their use is limited to development or production of particular supplies or parts, or performance of particular services (see FAR 45.101). Examples include jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, taps and gauges. Contractors shall separately report:
              (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and
              (2) All other items.
              (i) Special test equipment. Includes costs of equipment used to accomplish special purpose testing in performing a contract, and items or assemblies of equipment (see FAR 45.101). Contractors shall separately report:
              (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and
              (2) All other items.
              (j) Material. Includes costs of NASA-owned property held in inventory regardless of whether or not it is unique to NASA programs, that may become a part of an end item or be expended in performing a contract. Examples include raw and processed material, spares, parts, assemblies, small tools and supplies. Material that is part of work-in-process is not included. Contractors shall report the amount for all Materials in inventory, regardless of unit acquisition cost.
              (k) Agency-Peculiar Property. Includes costs of completed items, unique to NASA aeronautical and space programs, which are capable of stand-alone operation. Examples include research aircraft, reusable space vehicles, ground support equipment, prototypes, and mock-ups. The amount of property, title to which vests in NASA as a result of progress payments to fixed price subcontractors, shall be included to reflect the pro rata cost of undelivered agency-peculiar property. Completed end items not related to the International Space Station or the Space Shuttle program which otherwise meet the definition of Agency-Peculiar Property, and are destined for permanent operation in space, such as satellites and space probes, shall not be reported. Contractors shall separately report:
              (1) The amount for all items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more; and
              (2) All other items.
              (l) Contract Work-in-Process. Work-in-process (WIP) consists of property items under construction (i.e., not complete). It includes costs of all work-in-process regardless of value, and excludes costs of completed items reported in other categories. While the costs of WIP for International Space Station and Space Shuttle components should be included as WIP, satellites and space probes and their components should be excluded from WIP as those items will be accounted for by NASA.

              Transfers of property.

              A transfer is a change in accountability between and among prime contracts, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies (e.g., between contracts of the same NASA Center, contracts of different NASA Centers, a contract of one NASA Center to another, a NASA Center to a contract of another NASA Center, and a contract to another Government agency or its contract). To enable NASA to properly control and account for all transfers, they shall be adequately documented. Adequate documentation includes the appropriate dollar amount of the asset(s) transferred (as prescribed in 1845.7101-3) and the formal, signed NASA or contractor authorization approving the transfer. In addition, procurement, property, and financial organizations at NASA Centers must effect all transfers of accountability, although physical shipment and receipt of property may be made directly by contractors. The procedures described in this section shall be followed to provide an administrative and audit trail, even if property is physically shipped directly from one contractor to another. Property shipped between September 1 and September 30, inclusively, shall be accounted for and reported by the shipping contractor, regardless of the method of shipment, unless written evidence of receipt at destination has been received. Repairables provided under fixed price repair contracts that include the clause at 1852.245-72, Liability for Government Property Furnished for Repair or Other Services, remain accountable to the cognizant NASA Center and are not reportable on NF 1018; repairables provided under a cost-reimbursement contract, however, are accountable to the contractor and reportable on NF 1018. All materials provided to conduct repairs are reportable, regardless of contract type.
              (a) Approval and notification. The contractor must obtain approval of the contracting officer or designee for transfers of property off the prime contract before shipment. Each shipping document must be signed by the contracting officer or designee demonstrating such approval. Each shipping document must contain contract numbers, shipping references, property classifications in which the items are recorded (including Federal Supply Classification group (FSC) codes for equipment), unit acquisition costs (as defined in 1845.7101-3, Unit Acquisition Cost), original Government acquisition dates for items with a unit acquisition cost of $500,000 or more and a useful life of two years or more, and any other appropriate identifying or descriptive data. Where the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, is used, the FSC code will be part of the national stock number (NSN) entered in Block 16 or, if the NSN is not provided, the FSC alone shall be shown in Block 16. The original Government acquisition date shall be shown in Block 23, by item. Other formats, such as the DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, should be clearly annotated with the required information. Unit acquisition costs shall be obtained from records maintained pursuant to FAR part 45 and this part 1845, or, for uncompleted items where property records have not yet been established, from such other record systems as are appropriate such as manufacturing or engineering records used for work control and billing purposes. Shipping contractors shall furnish a copy of the formally approved shipping document to the cognizant property administrator. Shipping and receiving contractors shall promptly submit copies of shipping and receiving documents to the Center Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Finance, responsible for their respective contracts when accountability for NASA property is transferred to, or received from, other contracts, contractors, NASA Centers, or Government agencies.
              (b) Reclassification. If property is transferred to another contract or contractor, the receiving contractor shall record the property in the same property classification and amount appearing on the shipping document. For example, when a contractor receives an item from another contractor that is identified on the shipping document as equipment, but that the recipient intends to incorporate into special test equipment, the recipient shall first record the item in the equipment account and subsequently reclassify it as special test equipment. Reclassification of equipment, special tooling, special test equipment, or agency-peculiar property requires prior approval of the contracting officer or a designee.
              (c) Incomplete documentation. If contractors receive transfer documents having insufficient detail to properly record the transfer (e.g., omission of property classification, FSC, unit acquisition cost, Government acquisition date, required signatures, etc.) they shall request the omitted data directly from the shipping contractor or through the property administrator. The contracting officer shall assist the Government Property Administrator and the receiving contractor to obtain all required information for the receiving contractor to establish adequate property records.

              1845.7101-3
              Unit acquisition cost.
              (a) The unit acquisition cost shall include all costs incurred to bring the property to a form and location suitable for its intended use. The following is representative of the types of costs that shall be included, when applicable:
              (1) Amounts paid to vendors or other contractors.
              (2) Transportation charges to the point of initial use.
              (3) Handling and storage charges.
              (4) Labor and other direct or indirect production costs (for assets produced or constructed).
              (5) Engineering, architectural, and other outside services for designs, plans, specifications, and surveys.
              (6) Acquisition and preparation costs of buildings and other facilities.
              (7) An appropriate share of the cost of the equipment and facilities used in construction work.
              (8) Fixed equipment and related installation costs required for activities in a building or facility.
              (9) Direct costs of inspection, supervision, and administration of construction contracts and construction work.
              (10) Legal and recording fees and damage claims.
              (11) Fair values of facilities and equipment donated to the Government.

              (b) Acquisition cost shall include, where appropriate, for contractor acquired property, related fees, or a pro rata portion of fees, paid by NASA to the contractor. Situations where inclusion of fees in the acquisition cost would be appropriate are those in which the contractor designs, develops, fabricates or purchases property for NASA and part of the fees paid to the contractor by NASA are related to that effort.
              (c) Acquisition cost shall be developed using actual costs to the greatest extent possible, especially costs directly related to fabrication such as labor and materials. Where estimates are used, there must be a documented methodology based on a historical basis. All acquisition costs shall be properly documented, supported and retained. Supporting documentation shall be made available upon request.
              (d) The use of weighted average methodologies is acceptable for valuation of Material.
              (e) Contractors shall report unit acquisition costs using records that are part of the prescribed property or financial control system as provided in this section. Fabrication costs shall be based on approved systems or procedures and include all direct and indirect costs of fabrication.
              (f) Only modifications that improve an item's capacity or extend its useful life two years or more and that cost $500,000 or more shall be reported on the NF 1018 on the $500,000 & Over line. The costs of any other modifications, excluding routine maintenance, will be reported on the Under $500,000 line. If an item's original unit acquisition cost is less than $500,000, but a single subsequent modification costs $500,000 or more, that modification only will be reported as an item $500,000 or more on subsequent NF 1018s. The original acquisition cost of the item will continue to be included in the under $500,000 total. The quantity for the modified item will remain “1” and be reported with the original acquisition cost of the item. If an item's acquisition cost is reduced by removal of components so that its remaining acquisition cost is under $500,000, it shall be reported as under $500,000.

              (g) Software acquisition costs include software costs incurred up through acceptance testing and material internal costs incurred to implement the software and otherwise make the software ready for use. Costs incurred after acceptance testing are excluded. License, maintenance, training, and data conversion costs are also excluded. If the software is purchased as part of a package, the costs will need to be segregated in such manner as to ensure that the excluded costs (maintenance, training, etc.) are not reported as part of the software's acquisition cost. Enhancement costs for existing software should be added to the acquisition cost if the enhancement results in significant additional capability beyond that for which the software was originally developed (i.e. a capability that was not included in the original software specifications), the total cost of the enhancement is $1,000,000 or more, and the expected useful life of the enhanced software is 2 years or more. Include the same types of cost as indicated above under new software. Costs incurred solely to repair a design flaw or perform minor upgrades should not be included.
              (h) The computation of work in process (WIP) shall include all direct and indirect costs of fabrication, including associated systems, subsystems, and spare parts and components furnished or acquired and charged to work in process pending incorporation into a finished item. These types of items make up what is sometimes called production inventory and include programmed extra units to cover replacement during the fabrication process (production spares). Also included are deliverable items on which the contractor or a subcontractor has begun work, and materials issued from inventory. The computation of WIP shall incorporate the other requirements for unit acquisition cost as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. In addition, acquisition cost of property furnished by the Government, which has been incorporated in the property item under construction or in process of fabrication, should be included. Do not include costs for operation or repairing existing completed property items. Once the property is complete, include all the costs outlined above in its acquisition value in the property record. The WIP values are inception to date until such time as the WIP is completed. It does not include future costs.

              (a) Lost, damaged or destroyed. Deletion amounts that result from relief from responsibility under FAR 45.503 granted during the reporting period.
              (b) Transferred in Place. Deletion amounts that result from transfer of property to a follow-on prime contract or other prime contract with the same contractor.
              (c) Transferred to NASA Center accountability. Deletion amounts that result from transfer of accountability to the NASA Center responsible for the contract, whether or not items are physically moved.
              (d) Transferred to another NASA Center. Deletion amounts that result from transfer of accountability to a NASA Center other than the one responsible for the contract, whether or not items are physically moved.
              (e) Transferred to another Government agency. Deletion amounts that result from transfer of property to another Government agency.
              (f) Purchased at cost/returned for credit. Deletion amounts that result from contractor purchase or retention of contractor acquired property as provided in FAR 45.605-1, or from contractor returns to suppliers under FAR 45.605-2.
              (g) Disposed of through plant clearance process. Deletions other than transfers within the Federal Government, e.g., donations to eligible recipients, sold at less than cost, or abandoned/directed destruction, or trade-ins.
              (h) Other. Types of deletion other than those reported in paragraph (a) through (g) of this section such as those resulting from reclassifications (e.g. from equipment to agency-peculiar property).

              (a) Indemnification requests. (1) Contractor indemnification requests must be submitted to the cognizant contracting officer for the contract for which the indemnification clause is requested. The request shall be submitted six (6) months in advance of the desired effective date of the requested indemnification in order to allow sufficient time for the request to be reviewed, analyzed, and approved by the Agency. Contractors shall submit a single request and shall ensure that duplicate requests are not submitted by associated divisions, subsidiaries, or central offices of the contractor.
              (ii) The contractor's request for indemnification must identify a sufficient factual basis for indemnification by explaining specifically what work activities under the contract create the unusually hazardous or nuclear risk and identifying the timeframes in which the risk would be incurred.
              (iii) The contractor shall also provide evidence, such as a certificate of insurance or other customary proof of insurance, that such insurance is either in force or is available and will be in force during the indemnified period.
              (b) Action on indemnification requests. (1) If recommending approval, the contracting officer shall forward the required information to the NASA Headquarters Office of Procurement, Program Operations Division, along with the following:
              (i) For contracts of five years duration or longer, a determination, with supporting rationale, whether the indemnification approval and insurance coverage and premiums should be reviewed for adequacy and continued validity at points in time within the extended contract period.

              (ii) The specific definition of the unusually hazardous risk to which the contractor is exposed in the performance of the contract(s), including specificity about which activities present such risk and the anticipated timeframes in which the risk will be incurred;
              (iv) A complete discussion of the contractor's financial protection program; and
              (vi) The extent to, and conditions under, which indemnification is being approved for subcontracts.
              (2) The NASA Administrator is the approval authority for using the indemnification clause in a contract by a Memorandum of Decision.
              (4)(ii) If approving subcontractor indemnification, the contracting officer shall document the file with a memorandum for record addressing the items set forth in FAR 50.104-3(b) and include an analysis of the subcontractor's financial protection program. In performing this analysis, the contracting officer shall take into consideration the availability, cost, terms and conditions of insurance in relation to the unusually hazardous risk.

              As prescribed in 1804.470-4(a), insert the following clause:
              
                Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources (JAN 2011)
                (a) The contractor shall protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of NASA Electronic Information and IT resources and protect NASA Electronic Information from unauthorized disclosure.

                (b) This clause is applicable to all NASA contractors and sub-contractors that process, manage, access, or store unclassified electronic information, to include Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) information, for NASA in support of NASA's missions, programs, projects and/or institutional requirements. Applicable requirements, regulations, policies, and guidelines are identified in the Applicable Documents List (ADL) provided as an attachment to the contract. The documents listed in the ADL can be found at: http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocio/itsecurity/index.html. For policy information considered sensitive, the documents will be identified as such in the ADL and made available through the Contracting Officer.
                (c) Definitions. (1) IT resources means any hardware or software or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment, that is used to process, manage, access, or store electronic information.
                (2) NASA Electronic Information is any data (as defined in the Rights in Data clause of this contract) or information (including information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management information) that is processed, managed, accessed or stored on an IT system(s) in the performance of a NASA contract.

                (3) IT Security Management Plan—This plan shall describe the processes and procedures that will be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources that are developed, processed, or used under this contract. Unlike the IT security plan, which addresses the IT system, the IT Security Management Plan addresses how the contractor will manage personnel and processes associated with IT Security on the instant contract.

                (4) IT Security Plan—this is a FISMA requirement; see the ADL for applicable requirements. The IT Security Plan is specific to the IT System and not the contract. Within 30 days after award, the contractor shall develop and deliver an IT Security Management Plan to the Contracting Officer; the approval authority will be included in the ADL. All contractor personnel requiring physical or logical access to NASA IT resources must complete NASA's annual IT Security Awareness training. Refer to the IT Training policy located in the IT Security Web site at https://itsecurity.nasa.gov/policies/index.html.
                
                (d) The contractor shall afford Government access to the Contractor's and subcontractors' facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases, and personnel used in performance of the contract. Access shall be provided to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection (to include vulnerability testing), investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of NASA Electronic Information or to the function of IT systems operated on behalf of NASA, and to preserve evidence of computer crime.
                (e) At the completion of the contract, the contractor shall return all NASA information and IT resources provided to the contractor during the performance of the contract in accordance with retention documentation available in the ADL. The contractor shall provide a listing of all NASA Electronic information and IT resources generated in performance of the contract. At that time, the contractor shall request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will provide disposition instructions within 30 calendar days of the contractor's request. Parts of the clause and referenced ADL may be waived by the contracting officer, if the contractor's ongoing IT security program meets or exceeds the requirements of NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 2810.1 in effect at time of award. The current version of NPR 2810.1 is referenced in the ADL. The contractor shall submit a written waiver request to the Contracting Officer within 30 days of award. The waiver request will be reviewed by the Center IT Security Manager. If approved, the Contractor Officer will notify the contractor, by contract modification, which parts of the clause or provisions of the ADL are waived.
                (f) The contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph in all subcontracts that process, manage, access or store NASA Electronic Information in support of the mission of the Agency.

                Restrictions on Printing and Duplicating (NOV 2004)
                (a) The Contractor may duplicate or copy any documentation required by this contract in accordance with the provisions of the Government Printing and Binding Regulations, No. 26, S. Pub 101-9, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 20402, published by the Joint Committee on Printing, U.S. Congress.
                (b) The Contractor shall not perform, or procure from any commercial source, any printing in connection with the performance of work under this contract. The term “printing” includes the processes of composition, platemaking, presswork, duplicating, silk screen processes, binding, microform, and the end items of such processes and equipment.
                (c) The Contractor is authorized to duplicate or copy production units provided the requirement does not exceed 5,000 production units of any one page or 25,000 units in the aggregate of multiple pages. Such pages may not exceed a maximum image size of 10-3/4 by 14-1/4 inches. A “production unit” is one sheet, size 8-1/2 × 11 inches (215 × 280 mm), one side only, and one color ink.
                (d) This clause does not preclude writing, editing, preparation of manuscript copy, or preparation of related illustrative material as a part of this contract, or administrative duplicating/copying (for example, necessary forms and instructional materials used by the Contractor to respond to the terms of the contract).

                (e) Costs associated with printing, duplicating, or copying in excess of the limits in paragraph (c) of this clause are unallowable without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. If the Contractor has reason to believe that any activity required in fulfillment of the contract will necessitate any printing or substantial duplicating or copying, it immediately shall provide written notice to the Contracting Officer and request approval prior to proceeding with the activity. Requests will be processed by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the provisions of the Government Printing and Binding Regulations, NFS 1808.802, and NPR 1490.5, NASA Procedural Requirements for Printing, Duplicating, and Copying Management.
                
                (f) The Contractor shall include in each subcontract which may involve a requirement for any printing, duplicating, and copying in excess of the limits specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, a provision substantially the same as this clause, including this paragraph (f).

                Limitation of Future Contracting (DEC 1988)
                (a) The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest. Accordingly, the attention of prospective offerors is invited to FAR Subpart 9.5—Organizational Conflicts of Interest.
                (b) The nature of this conflict is [describe the conflict].
                (c) The restrictions upon future contracting are as follows:
                (1) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of tasks pursuant to this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements or work that are to be incorporated into a solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that solicitation as a prime of first-tier subcontractor under an ensuing NASA contract. This restriction shall remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor, sufficient to avoid unfair competitive advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the duration of the initial production contract). NASA shall not unilaterally require the Contractor to prepare such specifications or statements of work under this contract.
                (2) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other companies, and as long as these data remain proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect these data from unauthorized use and disclosure and agrees not to use them to complete with those other companies.

                (a) The Contractor shall comply with NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 6000.1, “Requirements for Packaging, Handling, and Transportation for Aeronautical and Space Systems, Equipment, and Associated Components”, as may be supplemented by the statement of work or specifications of this contract, for all items designated as Class I, II, or III.
                (b) The Contractor's packaging, handling, and transportation procedures may be used, in whole or in part, subject to the written approval of the Contracting Officer, provided (1) the Contractor's procedures are not in conflict with any requirements of this contract, and (2) the requirements of this contract shall take precedence in the event of any conflict with the Contractor's procedures.

                (1) This solicitation sets forth the work to be performed if a contract award results, and the Government's known delivery requirements for data (as defined in FAR 27.401). Any resulting contract may also provide the Government the option to order additional data under the Additional Data Requirements clause at FAR 52.227-16, if included in the contract. Any data delivered under the resulting contract will be subject to the Rights in Data-General clause at FAR 52.227-14 that is to be included in this contract. Under the latter clause, a Contractor may withhold from delivery data that qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software, and deliver form, fit, and function data in lieu thereof. The latter clause also may be used with its Alternates II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted rights notices, as appropriate. In addition, use of Alternate V with this latter clause provides the Government the right to inspect such data at the Contractor's facility.

Any identification of limited rights data or restricted computer software in the offeror's response is not determinative of the status of such data should a contract be awarded to the offeror.
                (3) The offeror has reviewed the requirements for the delivery of data or software and states [offeror check appropriate block]—
                ( ) None of the data proposed for fulfilling such requirements qualifies as limited rights data or restricted computer software.

                Caution to Offerors Furnishing Descriptive Literature (DEC 1988)
                Bidders are cautioned against furnishing as a part of their bids descriptive literature that includes language reserving to the bidder the right to deviate from the requirements of the invitation for bids. Statements that “Data are subject to change without notice,” “Prices subject to change without notice,” or words having a similar effect are examples of such reservation. The Government will reject as nonresponsive any bid that incorporates literature containing such language or any bid that must be evaluated by using literature containing such language. Bidders should clearly label any submissions of descriptive literature not intended to form a part of a bid as such in order to preclude any need for the Government to interpret the bidder's intent in submitting descriptive literature.

Except for foreign nationals, the identification information must be provided at least (fill-in) working days in advance of the conference.

              1852.216-72
              Award term.
              As prescribed in 1816.406-70(g), insert the following clause:
              
                Award Term (AUG 2017)
                (a) Based on overall Contractor performance as evaluated in accordance with the Award Term Plan, the Contracting Officer may extend the contract for the number and duration of award terms as set forth in the Award Term Plan.
                (b) The Contracting Officer will execute any earned award term period(s) through a unilateral contract modification. All contract provisions continue to apply throughout the contract period of performance or ordering period, including any award term period(s).
                (c) The Government will evaluate offerors for award purposes by adding the total price for all options and award terms to the price for the basic requirement. This evaluation will not obligate the Government to exercise any options or award term periods.
                (d) The Award Term Plan is attached in Section J. The Award Term Plan provides the methodology and schedule for evaluating Contractor performance, determining eligibility for an award term, and, together with Agency need for the contract and availability of funding, serves as the basis for award term decisions. The Contracting Officer may unilaterally revise the Award Term Plan. Any changes to the Award Term Plan will be in writing and incorporated into the contract through a unilateral modification citing this clause prior to the commencement of any evaluation period. The Contracting Officer will consult with the Contractor prior to the issuance of a revised Award Term Plan; however, the Contractor's consent is not required.
                (e) The award term evaluation(s) will be completed in accordance with the schedule in the Award Term Plan. The Contractor will be notified of the results and its eligibility to be considered for the respective award term no later than 120 days after the evaluation period set forth in the Award Term Plan. The Contractor may request a review of an award term evaluation which has resulted in the Contractor not earning the award term. The request shall be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer within 15 days after notification of the results of the evaluation.
                (f)(1) The Government has the unilateral right not to grant or to cancel award term periods and the associated Award Term Plan if—
                (i) The Contractor has failed to achieve the required performance measures for the corresponding evaluation period;
                (ii) After earning an award term, the Contractor fails to earn an award term in any succeeding year of contract performance, the Contracting Officer may cancel any award terms that the Contractor has earned, but that have not begun;
                (iii) The Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor that the Government no longer has a need for the award term period before the time an award term period is to begin;
                (iv) The Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the contract was set-aside for small businesses, and the Contractor rerepresents in accordance with FAR clause 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation, that it is no longer a small business; or

                Award Fee for End Item Contracts (AUG 2016)
                (a) The contractor can earn award fee, or base fee, if any, from a minimum of zero dollars to the maximum stated in NASA FAR Supplement clause 1852.216-85, “Estimated Cost and Award Fee” in this contract. All award fee evaluations, with the exception of the last evaluation, will be interim evaluations. At the last evaluation, which is final, the Contractor's performance for the entire contract will be evaluated to determine total earned award fee. No award fee or base fee will be paid to the Contractor if the final award fee evaluation is “poor/unsatisfactory.”
                (b) Beginning 6* months after the effective date of this contract, the Government will evaluate the Contractor's interim performance every 6* months to monitor Contractor performance prior to contract completion and to provide feedback to the Contractor. The evaluation will be performed in accordance with [identify performance evaluation plan] to this contract. The Contractor may submit a self-evaluation of performance for each period under consideration. These self-evaluations will be considered by the Government in its evaluation. The Government will advise the Contractor in writing of the evaluation results. The plan may be revised unilaterally by the Government prior to the beginning of any rating period to redirect emphasis.
                (c)(1) Base fee, if applicable, will be paid in [Insert “monthly”, or less frequent period] installments based on the percent of completion of the work as determined by the Contracting Officer.
                (2) Interim award fee payments will be made to the Contractor based on each interim evaluation. The amount of the interim award fee payment is limited to the lesser of the interim evaluation score or 80 percent of the fee allocated to that period less any provisional payments made during the period. All interim award fee payments will be superseded by the final award fee determination.

                (3) Provisional award fee payments will [insert “not” if applicable] be made under this contract pending each interim evaluation. If applicable, provisional award fee payments will be made to the Contractor on a [insert the frequency of provisional payments (not more often than monthly)] basis. The amount of award fee which will be provisionally paid in each evaluation period is limited to [Insert a percent not to exceed 80 percent] of the prior interim evaluation score (see [insert applicable cite]), except for the first evaluation period which is limited to [insert a percent not to exceed 80 percent] of the available award fee for that evaluation period. Provisional award fee payments made each evaluation period will be superseded by the interim award fee evaluation for that period. If provisional payments made exceed the interim evaluation score, the Contractor will either credit the next payment voucher for the amount of such overpayment or refund the difference to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer. If the Government determines that (i) the total amount of provisional fee payments will apparently substantially exceed the anticipated final evaluation score, or (ii) the prior interim evaluation is “poor/unsatisfactory,” the Contracting Officer will direct the suspension or reduction of the future payments and/or request a prompt refund of excess payments as appropriate. Written notification of the determination will be provided to the Contractor with a copy to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (Finance).
                
                (4) All interim (and provisional, if applicable) fee payments will be superseded by the fee determination made in the final award fee evaluation. The Government will then pay the Contractor, or the Contractor will refund to the Government the difference between the final award fee determination and the cumulative interim (and provisional, if applicable) fee payments. If the final award fee evaluation is “poor/unsatisfactory”, any base fee paid will be refunded to the Government.
                (5) Payment of base fee, if applicable, will be made based on submission of an invoice by the Contractor. Payment of award fee will be made by the [insert payment office] based on [Insert method of making award fee payment, e.g., issuance of a unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer].
                (d) The Contracting Officer may direct the withholding of interim award fee payments until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's interest relative to an orderly and timely closeout of the contract. This reserve shall not exceed 15 percent of the contracts total potential award fee or $100,000, whichever is less.

                Performance Incentive (APR 2015)
                (a) A performance incentive applies to the following item(s) under this contract: (1).
                The performance incentive will measure the performance of those items against the salient hardware performance requirement, called “unit(s) of measurement,” e.g., months in service or amount of data transmitted, identified below. The performance incentive becomes when the item is put into service. It includes a standard performance level, a positive incentive, and a negative incentive, which are described in this clause.
                (b) Standard performance level. At the standard performance level, the Contractor has met the contract requirement for the unit of measurement. Neither positive nor negative incentives apply when this level is achieved but not exceeded. The standard performance level for (1) __ is established as follows: (2).
                (c) Positive incentive. The Contractor earns a separate positive incentive amount for each item listed in paragraph (a) of this clause when the standard performance level for that item is exceeded. The amount earned for each item varies with the units of measurement achieved, up to a maximum positive performance incentive amount of $ (3) __ per item. The units of measurement and the incentive amounts associated with achieving each unit are shown below: (4).
                (d) Negative incentive. The Contractor will pay to the Government a negative incentive amount for each item that fails to achieve the standard performance level. The amount to be paid for each item varies with the units of measurement achieved, up to the maximum negative incentive amount of $ (5) __. The units of measurement and the incentive amounts associated with achieving each unit are shown below: (6).
                (e) The final calculation of positive or negative performance incentive amounts shall be done when performance (as defined by the unit of measurement) ceases or when the maximum positive incentive is reached.
                (1) When the Contracting Officer determines that the performance level achieved fell below the standard performance level, the Contractor will either pay the amount due the Government or credit the next payment voucher for the amount due, as directed by the Contracting Officer.
                (2) When the performance level exceeds the standard level, the Contractor may request payment of the incentive amount associated with a given level of performance, provided that such payments shall not be more frequent than monthly. When performance ceases or the maximum positive incentive is reached, the Government shall calculate the final performance incentive earned and unpaid and promptly remit it to the contractor.

                (f) If performance cannot be demonstrated, through no fault of the Contractor, within [insert number of months or years] after the date of acceptance by the Government, the Contractor will be paid [insert percentage] of the maximum performance incentive.
                (g) The decisions made as to the amount(s) of positive or negative incentives are subject to the Disputes clause.
                (1) Insert applicable item number(s) descriptor and/or nomenclature.
                (2) Insert a specific unit of measurement for each hardware item listed in (1) and each salient characteristic, if more than one.
                (3) Insert the maximum positive performance incentive amount (see 1816.402-270(e) (1) and (2)).
                (4) Insert all units of measurement and associated dollar amounts up to the maximum performance incentive.
                (5) Insert the appropriate amount in accordance with 1816.402-270(e).
                (6) Insert all units of measurement and associated dollar amounts up to the maximum negative performance incentive.

                (a) This contract is issued as a direct award between the contracting activity and the 8(a) contractor pursuant to a Partnership Agreement between the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Accordingly, the SBA is not a signatory to this contract. SBA does retain responsibility for 8(a) certification, 8(a) eligibility determinations and related issues, and providing counseling and assistance to the 8(a) contractor under the 8(a) program.

The contracting activity shall also coordinate with the SBA prior to processing any novation agreement. The contracting activity may assign contract administration functions to a contract administration office.
                (c) The contractor agrees to notify the Contracting Officer, simultaneous with its notification to SBA (as required by SBA's 8(a) regulations), when the owner or owners upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based plan to relinquish ownership or control of the concern. Consistent with Section 407 of Public Law 100-656, transfer of ownership or control shall result in termination of the contract for convenience, unless SBA waives the requirement for termination prior to the actual relinquishing of ownership and control.

                Mentor Requirements and Evaluation (APR 2015)
                (a) The purpose of the NASA Mentor-Protégé Program is for a NASA prime contractor to provide developmental assistance to certain subcontractors qualifying as protégés.
                Eligible protégés include certified small disadvantaged business concerns, women-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, minority institutions of higher education, as defined in FAR part 2, Definitions of Parts and Terms, active NASA SBIR/STTR Phase II companies and nonprofit agencies employing the blind or severely handicapped as defined in 41 CFR chapter 51.
                (b) NASA will evaluate the contractor's performance on the following factors. If this contract includes an award fee incentive, this assessment will be accomplished as part of the fee evaluation process.
                (1) Specific actions taken by the contractor, during the evaluation period, to increase the participation of protégés as subcontractors and suppliers;
                (2) Specific actions taken by the contractor during this evaluation period to develop the technical and corporate administrative expertise of a protégé as defined in the agreement;
                (3) To what extent the mentor and protégé have met the developmental milestones outlined in the agreement; and
                (4) To what extent the entities' participation in the Mentor-Protégé Program resulted in the protégé receiving competitive contract(s) and subcontract(s) from private firms and agencies other than the mentor.
                (5) To what extent the mentor contributed to advancing the protégé's technical readiness level.

                (c) Semiannual reports shall be submitted by the mentor and the protégé to the cognizant NASA center and NASA Headquarters Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP), following the semiannual report template found on the Web site at http://www.osbp.nasa.gov.
                  
                
                (d) The mentor will notify the cognizant NASA center and NASA OSBP in writing, at least 30 days in advance of the mentor's intent to voluntarily withdraw from the program or upon receipt of a protégé's notice to withdraw from the Program;
                (e) At the end of each year in the Mentor-Protégé Program, the mentor and protégé, as appropriate, will formally brief the NASA Mentor-Protégé program manager, the technical program manager, and the contracting officer during a formal program review regarding Program accomplishments, as it pertains to the approved agreement.
                (f) NASA may terminate mentor-protégé agreements for good cause, thereby excluding mentors or protégés from participating in the NASA Mentor-Protégé program. These actions shall be approved by the NASA OSBP. NASA shall terminate an agreement by delivering to the contractor a letter specifying the reason for termination and the effective date. Termination of an agreement does not constitute a termination of the subcontract between the mentor and the protégé. A plan for accomplishing the subcontract effort should the agreement be terminated shall be submitted with the agreement.

                (c) (1) The Contractor's program shall provide, where appropriate, for the suspension, disqualification, or dismissal of any employee in a sensitive position in any instance where a test conducted and confirmed under the Contractor's program indicates that such individual has used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance.
                (2) The Contractor's program shall further prohibit any such individual from working in a sensitive position on a NASA contract, unless such individual has completed a program of rehabilitation described in paragraph (d) of this clause.
                (3) The Contractor's program shall further prohibit any such individual from working in any sensitive position on a NASA contract if the individual is determined under the Contractor's program to have used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance and the individual meets any of the following criteria:
                (i) The individual had undertaken or completed a rehabilitation program described in paragraph (d) of this clause prior to such use;
                (ii) Following such determination, the individual refuses to undertake such a rehabilitation program;
                (iii) Following such determination, the individual fails to complete such a rehabilitation program; or
                (iv) The individual used a controlled substance or alcohol while on duty.
                (d) The Contractor shall institute and maintain an appropriate rehabilitation program which shall, as a minimum, provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of employees whose duties include responsibility for safety-sensitive, security, or National security functions who are in need of assistance in resolving problems with the use of alcohol or controlled substances.
                (e) The requirements of this clause shall take precedence over any state or local Government laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, standards, or orders that are inconsistent with the requirements of this clause.
                (f) For any collective bargaining agreement, the Contractor will negotiate the terms of its program with employee representatives, as appropriate, under labor relations laws or negotiated agreements. Such negotiation, however, cannot change the requirements of this clause. Employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will not be subject to the requirements of this clause until those agreements have been modified, as necessary; provided, however, that if one year after commencement of negotiation the parties have failed to reach agreement, an impasse will be determined to have been reached and the Contractor will unilaterally implement the requirements of this clause.
                (g) The Contractor shall insert a clause containing all the terms of this clause, including this paragraph (g), in all subcontracts in which work is performed by an employee in a sensitive position, except subcontracts for commercial items (see FAR parts 2 and 12).

              As prescribed in 1823.7001(e)(1), insert the following clause:
              
                Major Breach of Safety or Security (FEB 2002)

                (a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to NASA and is a material part of this contract. NASA's safety priority is to protect: (1) The public; (2) astronauts and pilots; (3) the NASA workforce (including contractor employees working on NASA contracts); and (4) high-value equipment and property. A major breach of safety may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this contract, including termination for default. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any “willful” or “repeat” violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.
                (b) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this contract, including termination for default. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in compromise of classified information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.
                (c) In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the Contractor shall report the breach to the Contracting Officer. If directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall conduct its own investigation and report the results to the Government. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if conducted.
              
              
              
                Alternate I (FEB 2006) As prescribed in 1823.7001(e)(2), substitute the following paragraphs (a) and (b) for paragraphs (a) and (b) of the basic clause:

Each subject invention for which the presumption of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this clause is conclusive or for which there has been a determination that it was made in the manner specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the Act shall be the exclusive property of the United States as represented by NASA unless the Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of the United States, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this clause.
                (3) Waiver of rights. (i) Section 20135(g) of the Act provides for the promulgation of regulations by which the Administrator may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or that may be made under conditions specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (1)(B) of Section 20135(b) of the Act. The promulgated NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, provide procedures for the Contractor to submit petitions (requests) for waiver of rights and guidance for NASA in acting on petitions for such waiver of rights.
                (ii) As provided in 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, the Contractor may petition, either prior to execution of the contract or within 30 days after execution of the contract, for advance waiver of rights to any invention or class of inventions that may be made under a contract. If such a petition is not submitted, or if after submission it is denied, the Contractor (or an employee inventor of the Contractor) may petition for waiver of rights to an identified subject invention within eight months of first disclosure of invention in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, or within such longer period as may be authorized in accordance with 14 CFR 1245.105.
                (c) Minimum rights reserved by the Government.
                (1) With respect to each subject invention for which a waiver of rights has been granted, the Government reserves—
                (i) An irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government in accordance with any treaty or agreement with the United States; and
                (ii) Such other rights as stated in 14 CFR 1245.107.
                (2) Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall be considered to grant to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a subject invention.
                (d) Minimum rights to the Contractor.
                (1) The Contractor is hereby granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application filed in any country on a subject invention in which the Government has title and in any resulting patent, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the Administrator except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.

                (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by the Administrator to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 37 CFR part 404, Licensing of Government Owned Inventions. The Contractor's license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of the Administrator to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
                (3) Before revoking or modifying the Contractor's license, the Contractor will be provided a written notice of the Administrator's intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by the Administrator for good cause shown) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal to the Administrator any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.
                (e) Contractor's obligations.
                (1) The Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures to assure that reportable items are promptly identified and disclosed to Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of this New Technology—Other Than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization clause within six months of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever occurs first in the performance of work under this contract. These procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of the reportable items, and records that show that the procedures for identifying and disclosing reportable items are followed. Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their effectiveness.
                (2) The Contractor shall disclose in writing each reportable item to the Contracting Officer within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for the administration of this New Technology—Other Than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization clause or within six months after the Contractor becomes aware that a reportable item has been made, whichever is earlier, but in any event for subject inventions before any on sale, public use, or publication of such invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure to the agency shall identify the inventor(s) or innovator(s) and this contract under which the reportable item was made. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical characteristics of the reportable item. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, sale or offer for sale, or public use of any subject invention and whether a manuscript describing such invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing a subject invention for publication or of any sale, offer for sale, or public use planned by the Contractor for such invention.

                (3) The Contractor may use whatever format is convenient to disclose reportable items required in subparagraph (e)(2). NASA prefers that the Contractor use either the electronic or paper version of NASA Form 1679, Disclosure of Invention and New Technology (including computer software) to disclose reportable items. Both the electronic and paper versions of NASA Form 1679 may be accessed at the electronic New Technology Reporting Web site http://invention.nasa.gov.
                
                (4) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the following:
                (i) Interim new technology summary reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, listing reportable items during that period, and certifying that all reportable items have been disclosed (or that there are no such inventions).
                (ii) A final new technology summary report, within 3 months after completion of the contracted work, listing all reportable items or certifying that there were no such reportable items, and listing all subcontracts at any tier containing a patent rights clause or certifying that there were no such subcontracts.
                (5) The Contractor agrees, upon written request of the Contracting Officer, to furnish additional technical and other information available to the Contractor as is necessary for the preparation of a patent application on a subject invention and for the prosecution of the patent application, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions.
                (6) The Contractor agrees, subject to paragraph 27.302(j) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), that the Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to this clause.
                (f) Examination of records relating to inventions.

                (1) The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether—
                (i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
                (ii) The Contractor has established and maintained the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this clause; and
                (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.
                (2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention that the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to disclose the invention to the agency for a determination of ownership rights.
                (3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.
                (g) Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to subcontracts).
                (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to—
                (i) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this clause;
                (ii) Disclose any reportable items pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this clause;
                (iii) Deliver acceptable interim new technology summary reports pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this clause or a final new technology summary report pursuant to paragraph (e)(4) (ii) of this clause; or
                (iv) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to paragraph (h)(4) of this clause.
                (2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.
                (3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of reportable items required by paragraph (e)(2) of this clause, and an acceptable final new technology summary report pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this clause.
                (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.
                (h) Subcontracts.
                (1) Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall—
                (i) Include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties) in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) with other than a small business firm or nonprofit organization for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work; or
                (ii) Include the clause at FAR 52.227-11, as modified by 1852.227-11, (suitably modified to identify the parties) in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) with a small business firm or nonprofit organization for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work; and
                (iii) Modify the applicable clause in any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and in all references to the Contractor, the subcontractor is substituted for the Contractor so that the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause.
                (2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept such a clause the Contractor—
                (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and
                (ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.
                (3) In the case of subcontracts at any tier, the agency, subcontractor, and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and NASA with respect to those matters covered by this clause.
                (4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract hereunder (regardless of tier) by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause in the subcontract, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.
                (5) The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the Contractor in the clause of paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (ii) of this clause, whichever is included in the subcontract, and the Contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.

                (i) Preference for United States industry. Unless provided otherwise, no Contractor that receives title to any subject invention and no assignee of any such Contractor shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement may be waived by the Administrator upon a showing by the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

              1852.227-71
              Requests for Waiver of Rights to Inventions.
              As prescribed in 1827.303(d)(2), insert the following provision in all solicitations that include the clause at 1852.227-70, New Technology—Other than a Small Business Firm or Nonprofit Organization:
              
                Requests for Waiver of Rights to Inventions (APR 2015)
                (a) In accordance with Section 20135(g) of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (51 U.S.C. 20135(g)) (hereinafter “the Act”) and the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1, NASA may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or that may be made under a NASA contract or subcontract with other than a small business firm or a domestic nonprofit organization if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served thereby. Waiver of rights in inventions made or that may be made under such NASA contract or subcontract may be requested at different time periods. Advance waiver of rights to any invention or class of inventions that may be made under a contract or subcontract may be requested prior to the execution of the contract or subcontract, or within 30 days after execution by the selected contractor (or such longer period as may be specified by the Contracting Officer). In addition, waiver of rights to an individually identified invention or to a class of inventions made and reported under a contract or subcontract may be requested, even though a request for an advance waiver was not made or, if made, was not granted.

                (b) Each request for waiver of rights shall be by petition to the Administrator. No specific forms need be used, but the request should contain a positive statement that waiver of rights is being requested under the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations; a clear indication of whether the request is for an advance waiver or for a waiver of rights for an individually identified invention or class of inventions; whether foreign rights are also requested and, if so, the countries, and a citation of the specific section or sections of the regulations under which such rights are requested. For individually identified inventions or a class of inventions, the petition shall identify each invention with particularity (e.g., by NASA's assigned number to the Disclosure of Invention and New Technology report or by title and inventorship). For advance waivers, the petition shall identify the invention or class of inventions that the Contractor believes will be made under the contract and for which waiver is being requested. To meet the statutory standard of “any invention or class of inventions,” the petition must be directed to a single invention or to inventions directed to a particular process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or to a narrowly-drawn, focused area of technology. Additionally, each petition shall include an identification of the petitioner; place of business and address; if petitioner is represented by counsel, the name, address and telephone number of the counsel; the name, address, and telephone number of the party with whom to communicate when the request is acted upon; the signature of the petitioner or authorized representative; and the date of signature. In general, waivers are granted in order to provide for the widest practicable dissemination of new technology resulting from NASA programs, and to promote early utilization, expeditious development, and continued availability of this new technology for commercial purposes and the public benefit. Thus, it is preferable that the petition also include a description of the Contractor's plan for commercializing the invention or class of inventions for which waiver is being requested (e.g., identify specific fields of use).
                (c) Petitions for advance waiver of rights should, preferably, be included with the proposal, or at least in advance of contract negotiations. Petitions for advance waiver, prior to contract execution, shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer. All other petitions shall be submitted to the Patent Representative designated in the contract.

                (d) Petitions submitted with proposals selected for negotiation of a contract will be forwarded by the Contracting Officer to the installation Patent Counsel for processing and then to the Inventions and Contributions Board. The Board will consider these petitions and where the Board makes the findings to support the waiver, the Board will recommend to the Administrator that waiver be granted, and will notify the petitioner and the Contracting Officer of the Administrator's determination. The Contracting Officer will be informed by the Board whenever there is insufficient time or information or other reasons to permit a decision to be made without unduly delaying the execution of the contract. In the latter event, the petitioner will be so notified by the Contracting Officer. All other petitions will be processed by installation Patent Counsel and forwarded to the Board. The Board shall notify the petitioner of its action and if waiver is granted, the conditions, reservations, and obligations thereof will be included in the Instrument of Waiver. Whenever the Board notifies a petitioner of a recommendation adverse to, or different from, the waiver requested, the petitioner may request reconsideration under procedures set forth in the Regulations.

              Invention Reporting and Rights—Foreign.
              As prescribed in 1827.303(e)(1), insert the following clause:
              
                Invention Reporting and Rights—Foreign (APR 2015)
                (a) As used in this clause, the term “invention” means any invention, discovery or improvement, and “made” means the conception or first actual demonstration that the invention is useful and operable.
                (b) The Contractor shall report promptly to the Contracting Officer each invention made in the performance of work under this contract. The report of each such invention shall:
                (1) Identify the inventor(s) by full name; and
                (2) Include such full and complete technical information concerning the invention as is necessary to enable an understanding of the nature and operation thereof.

                (c) The Contractor hereby grants to the Government of the United States of America as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration the full right, title and interest in and to each such invention throughout the world, except for the foreign country in which this contract is to be performed. As to such foreign country, Contractor hereby grants to the Government of the United States of America as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration an irrevocable, nontransferable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to practice each such invention by or on behalf of the United States of America or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with the United States of America, provided that Contractor within a reasonable time files a patent application in that foreign country for each such invention. Where Contractor does not elect to file such patent application for any such invention in that foreign country, full right, title and interest in and to such invention in that foreign country shall reside in the Government of the United States of America as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
                (d) The Contractor agrees to execute or to secure the execution of such legal instruments as may be necessary to confirm and to protect the rights granted by paragraph (c) of this clause, including papers incident to the filing and prosecution of patent applications.

              Commercial Computer Software License.
              As prescribed in 1827.409(g), insert the following clause:
              
                Commercial Computer Software License (APR 2015)

                (a) Any delivered commercial computer software (including documentation thereof) developed at private expense and claimed as proprietary shall be subject to the restricted rights in paragraph (d) of this clause. Where the vendor/contractor proposes its standard commercial software license, those applicable portions thereof consistent with Federal laws, standard industry practices, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the NASA FAR Supplement, including the restricted rights in paragraph (d) of this clause, are incorporated into and made a part of this purchase order/contract. Those portions of the vendor's/contractor's standard commercial license or lease agreement that conflict with Federal law (e.g., indemnity provisions or choice of law provisions that specify other than Federal law) are not incorporated into and made a part of this purchase order/contract and do not apply to any computer software delivered under this purchase order/contract.
                (b) If the vendor/contractor does not propose its standard commercial software license until after this purchase order/contract has been issued, or until at or after the time the computer software is delivered, such license shall nevertheless be deemed incorporated into and made a part of this purchase order/contract under the same terms and conditions as in paragraph (a) of this clause. For purposes of receiving updates, correction notices, consultation, and similar activities on the computer software, no document associated with the aforementioned activities shall alter the terms of this clause unless such document explicitly references this clause and an intent to amend this clause and is signed by the NASA Contracting Officer.
                (c) The vendor's/contractor's acceptance is expressly limited to the terms and conditions of this purchase order/contract. If the specified computer software is shipped or delivered to NASA, it shall be understood that the vendor/contractor has unconditionally accepted the terms and conditions set forth in this clause, and that such terms and conditions (including the incorporated license) constitute the entire agreement between the parties concerning rights in the computer software.
                (d) The following restricted rights shall apply:
                (1) The commercial computer software may not be used, reproduced, or disclosed by the Government, or Government contractors or their subcontractors at any tier, except as provided below or otherwise expressly stated in the purchase order/contract.
                (2) The commercial computer software may be—

                (i) Used, or copied for use, in or with any computer owned or leased by, or on behalf of, the Government; provided, the software is not used, nor copied for use, in or with more than one computer simultaneously, unless otherwise permitted by the license incorporated under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this clause;

              Government-furnished computer software and related technical data.

              As prescribed in 1827.409(m)(1), insert the following clause:
              
              
                GOVERNMENT-Furnished Computer Software and Related Technical Data (APR 2015)
                (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                “Government-furnished computer software” or “GFCS” means computer software:
                (1) In the possession of, or directly acquired by, the Government whereby the Government has title or license rights thereto; and
                (2) Subsequently furnished to the Contractor for performance of a Government contract.
                “Computer software,” “data” and “technical data” have the meaning provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 2.1—Definitions or the Rights in Data—General clause (FAR 52.227-14).
                (b) The Government shall furnish to the Contractor the GFCS described in this contract or in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Government shall furnish any related technical data needed for the intended use of the GFCS.
                (c) Use of GFCS and related technical data. The Contractor shall use the GFCS and related technical data, and any modified or enhanced versions thereof, only for performing work under this contract unless otherwise provided for in this contract or approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.
                (1) The Contractor shall not, without the express written permission of the Contracting Officer, reproduce, distribute copies, prepare derivative works, perform publicly, display publicly, release, or disclose the GFCS or related technical data to any person except for the performance of work under this contract.
                (2) The Contractor shall not modify or enhance the GFCS unless this contract specifically identifies the modifications and enhancements as work to be performed. If the GFCS is modified or enhanced pursuant to this contract, the Contractor shall provide to the Government the complete source code, if any, and all related documentation of the modified or enhanced GFCS.
                (3) Allocation of rights associated with any GFCS or related technical data modified or enhanced under this contract shall be defined by the FAR Rights in Data clause(s) included in this contract (as modified by any applicable NASA FAR Supplement clauses). If no Rights in Data clause is included in this contract, then the FAR Rights in Data—General (52.227-14) as modified by the NASA FAR Supplement (1852.227-14) shall apply to all data first produced in the performance of this contract and all data delivered under this contract.

                (4) The Contractor may provide the GFCS, and any modified or enhanced versions thereof, to subcontractors as necessary for the performance of work under this contract. Before release of the GFCS, and any modified or enhanced versions thereof, to such subcontractors (at any tier), the Contractor shall insert, or require the insertion of, this clause, including this paragraph (c)(4), suitably modified to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and in all references to the Contractor the subcontractor is substituted for the Contractor so that the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause.
                
                (d) The Government provides the GFCS in an “AS-IS” condition. The Government makes no warranty with respect to the serviceability and/or suitability of the GFCS for contract performance.
                (e) The Contracting Officer may by written notice, at any time—
                (1) Increase or decrease the amount of GFCS under this contract;
                (2) Substitute other GFCS for the GFCS previously furnished, to be furnished, or to be acquired by the Contractor for the Government under this contract;
                (3) Withdraw authority to use the GFCS or related technical data; or
                (4) Instruct the Contractor to return or dispose of the GFCS and related technical data.
                (f) Title to or license rights in GFCS. The Government shall retain title to or license rights in all GFCS. Title to or license rights in GFCS shall not be affected by its incorporation into or attachment to any data not owned by or licensed to the Government.
                (g) Waiver of Claims and Indemnification. The Contractor agrees to waive any and all claims against the Government and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, and employees from every claim or liability, including attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses, arising out of, or in any way related to, the misuse or unauthorized modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the GFCS and related technical data by the Contractor, a subcontractor, or by any person to whom the Contractor has released or disclosed such GFCS or related technical data.
                (h) Flow-down of Waiver of Claims and Indemnification. In the event a contract includes this NASA FAR Supplement clause 1852.227-88, the Contractor shall include the foregoing clause 1852.227-88(g), suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, which involve use of the GFCS and/or related technical data in any way. At all tiers, the clause shall be modified to define GFCS as it is defined herein and to identify the parties as follows: references to the Government are not changed, and in all references to the Contractor the subcontractor is substituted for the Contractor so that the subcontractor has all rights and obligations of the Contractor in the clause. In subcontracts, at any tier, the Government, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause 1852.227-88 constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Government with respect to the matters covered by the clause.

              Aircraft ground and flight risk.
              As prescribed in 1828.370(a), insert the following clause. The purpose of this clause is to have the Government assume risks that generally entail unusually high insurance premiums and are not covered by the contractor's contents, work-in-process, and similar insurance. Since the definitions in the clause may not cover every situation that should be covered to achieve this purpose, the clause may be modified as follows: If the contract covers helicopters, vertical take-off aircraft, lighter-than-air airships, or other nonconventional types of aircraft, the definition of “aircraft” should be modified to specify that the aircraft has reached a point of manufacture comparable to that specified in the standard definition, which is written for conventional winged aircraft. The definition of “in the open” may be modified to include “hush houses,” test hangars, comparable structures, and other designated areas. In addition, clause paragraph (d)(3) may be modified to provide for Government assumption of risk of transportation by conveyance on streets or highways if the contracting officer determines that this transportation is limited to the vicinity of the contractor's premises and is merely incident to work being performed under the contract.
              
                Aircraft Ground and Flight Risk (OCT 1996)
                (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, except as may be specifically provided in the Schedule as an exception to this clause, the Government, subject to the definitions and limitations of this clause, assumes the risk of damage to, or loss or destruction of, aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight and agrees that the Contractor shall not be liable to the Government for any such damage, loss, or destruction.
                (b) For the purposes of this clause, the following definitions apply:
                (1) Unless otherwise specifically provided in the Schedule, “aircraft” includes—

                (i) Aircraft (including both complete aircraft and aircraft in the course of being manufactured, disassembled, or reassembled; provided that an engine, wing, or a portion of a wing is attached to the fuselage) to be furnished to the Government under this contract (whether before or after Government acceptance); and
                
                (ii) Aircraft (regardless of whether in a state of disassembly or reassembly) furnished by the Government to the Contractor under this contract, including all property installed in, being installed in, or temporarily removed from them, unless the aircraft and property are covered by a separate bailment agreement.
                (2) “In the open” means located wholly outside of buildings on the Contractor's premises, or at such other places as may be described in the Schedule as being in the open for the purposes of this clause, except that aircraft furnished by the Government are considered to be in the open at all times while in the Contractor's possession, care, custody, or control.
                (3) “Flight” includes any flight demonstration, flight test, taxi test, or other flight made in the performance of this contract, or for the purpose of safeguarding the aircraft, or previously approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.
                (i) With respect to land-based aircraft, flight commences with the taxi roll from a flight line on the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has completed the taxi roll in returning to a flight line on the Contractor's premises.
                (ii) With respect to seaplanes, flight commences with the launching from a ramp on the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has completed its landing run upon return and is beached at a ramp on the Contractor's premises.
                (iii) With respect to helicopters, flight commences upon engagement of the rotors for the purpose of take-off from the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has returned to the ground on the Contractor's premises and the rotors are disengaged.
                (iv) With respect to vertical take-off aircraft, flight commences upon disengagement from any launching platform or device on the Contractor's premises and continues until the aircraft has been re-engaged to any launching platform or device on the Contractor's premises; provided, however, that aircraft off the Contractor's premises shall be deemed to be in flight when on the ground or water only during periods of reasonable duration following emergency landing, other landings made in the performance of this contract, or landings approved by the Contracting Officer in writing.
                (4) “Contractor's premises” means those premises designated as such in the Schedule or in writing by the Contracting Officer, and any other place to which aircraft are moved for the purpose of safeguarding the aircraft.
                (5) “Operation” means operations and tests, other than on any production line, of aircraft not in flight, whether or not the aircraft is in the open or in motion. It includes operations and tests of equipment, accessories, and power plants only when installed in aircraft.
                (6) “Flight crew members” means the pilot, copilot, and, unless otherwise specifically provided in the Schedule, the flight engineer and navigator when requirement or assigned to their respective crew positions to conduct any flight on behalf of the Contractor.
                (7) “Contractor's managerial personnel” means the Contractor's directors, officers, and any managers, superintendents, or equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of all or substantially all of the Contractor's business or of the Contractor's operations at any one plant, a separate location at which this contract is performed, or a separate and complete major industrial operation in connection with the performance of this contract.
                (c)(1) The Government's assumption of risk under this clause, as to aircraft in the open, shall continue in effect unless terminated pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. If the Contracting Officer finds that an aircraft is in the open under unreasonable conditions, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the conditions found to be unreasonable and require the Contractor to correct them within a reasonable time.
                (2) Upon receipt of this notice, the Contractor shall act promptly to correct these conditions, regardless of whether it agrees that they are in fact unreasonable. To the extent that the Contracting Officer may later determine that they were not in fact unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price to compensate the Contractor for any additional costs incurred in correcting them, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
                (3)(i) If the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor has failed to act promptly to correct unreasonable conditions or has failed to correct them within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may by written notice terminate the Government's assumption of risk under this clause for any aircraft which is in the open under those conditions. This termination shall be effective at 12:01 A.M. on the 15th day following the day of receipt by the Contractor of the notice.
                (ii) If the Contracting Officer later determines that the Contractor acted promptly to correct the conditions or that the time taken by the Contractor was not in fact unreasonable, an equitable adjustment shall, notwithstanding paragraph (g) of this clause, be made to compensate the Contractor for any additional costs incurred as a result of the termination, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.

                (4) If the Government's assumption of risk under this clause is terminated in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this clause, the risk of loss with respect to Government-furnished property shall be determined in accordance with the Government property clause of this contract, if any, until the Government's assumption of risk is reinstated in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this clause.
                (5)(i) When unreasonable conditions have been corrected, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Government. The Government may or may not elect to reassume the risks and relieve the Contractor of liabilities as provided in this clause, and the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor of the Government's election.
                (ii) If, after correction of the conditions, the Government elects to reassume the risks and relieve the Contractor of liabilities, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any costs of insurance extending from the end of the third working day after the Contractor notifies the Government of the correction until the Government notifies the Contractor of that election.
                (iii) If the Government elects not to reassume the risks and the conditions have in fact been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any costs of insurance extending after the third working day referred to in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this clause.
                (d) The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage to, or loss or destruction of aircraft—
                (1) Resulting from failure of the Contractor, due to willful misconduct or lack of good faith of any of the Contractor's managerial personnel, to maintain and administer a program for protecting and preserving aircraft in the open and during operation, in accordance with sound industrial practice;
                (2) Sustained during flight if the flight crew members conducting the flight have not been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer;
                (3) While in the course of transportation by rail or by conveyance on public streets, highways, or waterways, except for Government-furnished property;
                (4) The extent that the damage, loss, or destruction is in fact covered by insurance;
                (5) Consisting of wear and tear, deterioration (including rust and corrosion), freezing, or mechanical, structural, or electrical breakdown or failure, unless this damage is the result of other loss, damage, or destruction covered by this clause (except that, in the case of Government-furnished property, if the damage consists of reasonable wear and tear or deterioration or results from an inherent defect in such property, this exclusion shall not apply); or
                (6) Sustained while the aircraft is being worked upon and directly resulting from the work, including but not limited to any repairing, adjusting, servicing, or maintenance operation, unless the damage, loss, or destruction is of a type that would be covered by insurance that would customarily have been maintained by the Contractor at the time of the damage, loss, or destruction, but for the Government's assumption of risk under this clause.
                (e)(1) With the exception of damage to, or loss or destruction of, aircraft in flight, the Government's assumption of risk under this clause shall not extend to the first $1,000 of loss or damage resulting from each separately occurring event. The Contractor assumes the risk of and shall be responsible for the first $1,000 of loss of or damage to aircraft in the open or during operation resulting from each separately occurring event, except for reasonable wear and tear and except to the extent the loss or damage is caused by negligence of Government personnel.
                (2) If the Government elects to require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition immediately prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause shall not include the dollar amount of the risk assumed by the Contractor under this paragraph (e). If the Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees to credit the contract price or pay the Government $1,000 (or the amount of the loss if smaller) as directed by the Contracting Officer.
                (f) No subcontractor may be relieved from liability for damage to, or loss or destruction of, aircraft while in its possession or control, except to the extent that the subcontract, with the Contracting Officer's prior written approval, provides for relief of the subcontractor from that liability. In the absence of such approval, the subcontract shall require the return of the aircraft in as good condition as when received, except for reasonable wear and tear or for the utilization of the property in accordance with the provisions of this contract. If a subcontractor has not been relieved from liability and any damage, loss, or destruction occurs, the Contractor shall enforce the liability of the subcontractor for that damage to, or loss or destruction of, the aircraft for the benefit of the Government.
                (g) The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and will not include, except as this clause may otherwise authorize, any charge or contingency reserve for insurance (including self-insurance funds or reserves) covering any damage to, or loss or destruction of, aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in flight, the risk of which has been assumed by the Government under this clause, whether or not such assumption may be terminated as to aircraft in the open.

                (h)(1) In the event of damage to, or loss or destruction of, aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor shall take all reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further damage, separate damaged and undamaged aircraft, and put all aircraft in the best possible order. Further, except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of this clause, the Contractor should furnish to the Contracting Officer a statement of—
                (i) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;
                (ii) The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;
                (iii) All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft are a part; and
                (iv) Any insurance covering any part of the interest in the commingled property.
                (2) Except in cases covered by paragraph (e) of this clause, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due under this contract for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing its obligations under this paragraph (h), and this contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
                (i)(1) If, before delivery and acceptance by the Government, any aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government has under this clause assumed the risk of that damage, loss, or destruction, the Government shall either
                (i) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition immediately prior to the damage or
                (ii) Terminate this contract with respect to that aircraft.
                (2) If the Government requires that the aircraft be replaced or restored, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due under this contract and in the time required for its performance, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
                (3) If this contract is terminated under this paragraph (i)(1)(ii) with respect to the aircraft, and under this clause the Government has assumed the risk of the damage, loss, or destruction, the Contractor shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft (or, if applicable, any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any amounts the Contracting Officer determines (i) that it would have cost the Contractor to complete the aircraft (or any work to be performed on it), together with any anticipated profit on the uncompleted work and (ii) to be the value, if any, of the damaged aircraft or any remaining portion of it retained by the Contractor. The Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of disposition of the damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft or any remaining parts of it, and, if the Contractor incurs additional costs as a result of such disposition, a further equitable adjustment shall be made in the amount due to the Contractor.
                (j)(1) If the Contractor is at any time reimbursed or compensated by any third person for any damage, loss, or destruction of any aircraft, the risk of which has been assumed by the Government under this clause and for which the Contractor has been compensated by the Government, it shall equitably reimburse the Government.
                (2) The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's rights to recover against third parties for any such damage, loss, or destruction and, upon the request of the Contracting Officer, shall at the Government's expense furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the prosecution of suits and the execution of instruments of assignment or subrogation in favor of the Government) in obtaining recovery.

                (b) For the purposes of this clause—
                (1) Unless otherwise specifically provided in the Schedule, “aircraft” includes any aircraft, whether furnished by the Contractor under this contract (either before or after Government acceptance) or furnished by the Government to the Contractor under this contract, including all Government property placed or installed or attached to the aircraft, unless the aircraft and property are covered by a separate bailment agreement.
                (2) “Flight” includes any flight demonstration, flight test, taxi test, or other flight made in the performance of this contract, or for the purpose of safeguarding the aircraft, or previously approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.
                (i) With respect to land-based aircraft, flight commences with the taxi roll from a flight line and continues until the aircraft has completed the taxi roll to a flight line.
                (ii) With respect to seaplanes, flight commences with the launching from a ramp and continues until the aircraft has completed its landing run and is beached at a ramp.

                (iii) With respect to helicopters, flight commences upon engagement of the rotors for the purpose of take-off and continues until the aircraft has returned to the ground and rotors are disengaged.
                (iv) With respect to vertical take-off aircraft, flight commences upon disengagement from any launching platform or device and continues until the aircraft has been re-engaged to any launching platform or device.

                The Contractor shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage as follows for the performance of this contract:
                (a) Worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance as required by applicable Federal and state workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with the Contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical. The employer's liability coverage shall be at least $100,000, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers.

The objective of this clause is to extend this cross-waiver of liability to NASA contracts in the interest of encouraging participation in the exploration, exploitation, and use of outer space through the International Space Station (ISS). The Parties intend that this cross-waiver of liability be broadly construed to achieve this objective.
                (b) As used in this clause, the term:

A Partner State includes its Cooperating Agency. It also includes any entity specified in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NASA and the Government of Japan to assist the Government of Japan's Cooperating Agency in the implementation of that MOU.
                (5) “Party” means a party to a NASA Space Act agreement involving activities in connection with the ISS and a party that is neither the prime contractor under this contract nor a subcontractor at any tier.
                (6) “Payload” means all property to be flown or used on or in a Launch Vehicle or the ISS.
                (7) “Protected Space Operations” means all Launch or Transfer Vehicle activities, ISS activities, and Payload activities on Earth, in outer space, or in transit between Earth and outer space in implementation of the IGA, MOUs concluded pursuant to the IGA, implementing arrangements, and contracts to perform work in support of NASA's obligations under these Agreements. It includes, but is not limited to:
                (i) Research, design, development, test, manufacture, assembly, integration, operation, or use of Launch or Transfer Vehicles, the ISS, Payloads, or instruments, as well as related support equipment and facilities and services; and

                (ii) A user or customer of a Party or a Partner State at any tier; or
                (iii) A contractor or subcontractor of a user or customer of a Party or a Partner State at any tier. The terms “contractor” and “subcontractor” include suppliers of any kind.
                (9) “Transfer Vehicle” means any vehicle that operates in space and transfers Payloads or persons or both between two different space objects, between two different locations on the same space object, or between a space object and the surface of a celestial body.

                (c) Cross-waiver of liability:
                (1) The Contractor agrees to a cross-waiver of liability pursuant to which it waives all claims against any of the entities or persons listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this clause based on Damage arising out of Protected Space Operations. This cross-waiver shall apply only if the person, entity, or property causing the Damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations. The cross-waiver shall apply to any claims for Damage, whatever the legal basis for such claims, against:
                (i) A Party as defined in (b)(5) of this clause;
                (ii) A Partner State other than the United States of America;
                (iii) A Related Entity of any entity identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this clause; or

                (ii) Require that their subcontractors waive all claims against the entities or persons identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this clause.

                (3) For avoidance of doubt, this cross-waiver of liability includes a cross-waiver of claims arising from the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, which entered into force on September 1, 1972, where the person, entity, or property causing the Damage is involved in Protected Space Operations and the person, entity, or property damaged is damaged by virtue of its involvement in Protected Space Operations.
                (4) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this clause, this cross-waiver of liability shall not be applicable to:
                (i) Claims between the Government and its own contractors or between its own contractors and subcontractors;
                (ii) Claims made by a natural person, his/her estate, survivors or subrogees (except when a subrogee is a Party to an Agreement or is otherwise bound by the terms of this cross-waiver) for bodily injury to, or other impairment of health of, or death of, such person;
                (iii) Claims for Damage caused by willful misconduct;
                (iv) Intellectual property claims;

                (5) Nothing in this clause shall be construed to create the basis for a claim or suit where none would otherwise exist.
                (6) This cross-waiver shall not be applicable when 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IX, Chapter 701 is applicable.

                Limitation of Funds (Fixed-Price Contract) (MAR 1989)
                (a) Of the total price of items __ through __, the sum of $__ is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. It is anticipated that from time to time additional funds will be allocated to the contract in accordance with the following schedule, until the total price of said items is allotted:
                Schedule for Allotment of Funds
                Date    Amounts
                
                (b) The Contractor agrees to perform or have performed work on the items specified in paragraph (a) of this clause up to the point at which, if this contract is terminated pursuant to the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause of this contract, the total amount payable by the Government (including amounts payable for subcontracts and settlement costs) pursuant to paragraphs (f) and (g) of that clause would, in the exercise of reasonable judgment by the Contractor, approximate the total amount at the time allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not obligated to continue performance of the work beyond that point. The Government is not obligated in any event to pay or reimburse the Contractor more than the amount from time to time allotted to the contract, anything to the contrary in the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause notwithstanding.
                (c) (1) It is contemplated that funds presently allotted to this contract will cover the work to be performed until __.

                (2) If funds allotted are considered by the Contractor to be inadequate to cover the work to be performed until that date, or an agreed date substituted for it, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing when within the next 60 days the work will reach a point at which, if the contract is terminated pursuant to the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause of this contract, the total amount payable by the Government (including amounts payable for subcontracts and settlement costs) pursuant to paragraphs (f) and (g) of that clause will approximate 75 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract.
                (3) (i) The notice shall state the estimated date when the point referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause will be reached and the estimated amount of additional funds required to continue performance to the date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or an agreed date substituted for it.
                (ii) The Contractor shall, 60 days in advance of the date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or an agreed date substituted for it, advise the Contracting Officer in writing as to the estimated amount of additional funds required for the timely performance of the contract for a further period as may be specified in the contract or otherwise agreed to by the parties.
                (4) If, after the notification referred to in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this clause, additional funds are not allotted by the date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or an agreed date substituted for it, the Contracting Officer shall, upon the Contractor's written request, terminate this contract on that date or on the date set forth in the request, whichever is later, pursuant to the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause.
                (d) When additional funds are allotted from time to time for continued performance of the work under this contract, the parties shall agree on the applicable period of contract performance to be covered by these funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause shall apply to these additional allotted funds and the substituted date pertaining to them, and the contract shall be modified accordingly.
                (e) If, solely by reason of the Government's failure to allot additional funds in amounts sufficient for the timely performance of this contract, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract, and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the items to be delivered, or in the time of delivery, or both.
                (f) The Government may at any time before termination, and, with the consent of the Contractor, after notice of termination, allot additional funds for this contract.
                (g) The provisions of this clause with respect to termination shall in no way be deemed to limit the rights of the Government under the default clause of this contract. The provisions of this Limitation of Funds clause are limited to the work on and allotment of funds for the items set forth in paragraph (a). This clause shall become inoperative upon the allotment of funds for the total price of said work except for rights and obligations then existing under this clause.
                (h) Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause of this contract.

                Earned Value Management System (NOV 2006)
                (a) In the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall use—
                (1) An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that has been determined by the Cognizant Federal Agency to be compliant with the EVMS guidelines specified in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA)—748 Standard, Industry Guidelines for Earned Value Management Systems (current version at the time of award) to manage this contract; and
                (2) Earned Value Management (EVM) procedures that provide for generation of timely, accurate, reliable, and traceable information for the Contract Performance Report (CPR) and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) required by the data requirements descriptions in the contract.

                (b) If, at the time of award, the Contractor's EVMS has not been determined by the Cognizant Federal Agency to be compliant with the EVMS guidelines, or the Contractor does not have an existing EVMS that is compliant with the guidelines in the ANSI/EIA-748 Standard (current version at the time of award), the Contractor shall apply the system to the contract and shall take timely action to implement its plan to obtain compliance/validation. The Contractor shall follow and implement the approved compliance/validation plan in a timely fashion. The Government will conduct a Compliance Review to assess the contactor's compliance with its plan, and if the Contractor does not follow the approved implementation schedule or correct all resulting system deficiencies identified as a result of the compliance review within a reasonable time, the Contracting Officer may take remedial action, that may include, but is not limited to, a reduction in fee.

                (c) The Government will conduct Integrated Baseline Reviews (IBRs). Such reviews shall be scheduled and conducted as early as practicable, and if a pre-award IBR has not been conducted, a post-award IBR should be conducted within 180 calendar days after contract award, or the exercise of significant contract options, or within 60 calendar days after distribution of a supplemental agreement that implements a significant funding realignment or effects a significant change in contractual requirements (e.g., incorporation of major modifications). The objective of IBRs is for the Government and the Contractor to jointly assess the Contractor's baseline to be used for performance measurement to ensure complete coverage of the statement of work, logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, and identification of inherent risks. See the NASA IBR Handbook (http://evm.nasa.gov/handbooks.html) for guidance.
                (d) Unless a waiver is granted by the Cognizant Federal Agency, Contractor proposed EVMS changes require approval of the Cognizant Federal Agency prior to implementation. The Cognizant Federal Agency shall advise the Contractor of the acceptability of such changes within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of proposed changes from the Contractor. If the advance approval requirements are waived by the Cognizant Federal Agency, the Contractor shall disclose EVMS changes to the Cognizant Federal Agency at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of implementation.
                (e) The Contractor agrees to provide access to all pertinent records and data requested by the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized representative. Access is to permit Government surveillance to ensure that the Contractor's EVMS complies, and continues to comply, with the EVMS guidelines referenced in paragraph (a) of this clause, and to demonstrate—
                (1) Proper implementation of the procedures generating the cost and schedule information being used to satisfy the contract data requirements;
                (2) Continuing application of the accepted company procedures in satisfying the CPR required by the contract through recurring program/project and contract surveillance; and
                (3) Implementation of any corrective actions identified during the surveillance process.
                (f) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that its subcontractors, identified below, comply with the EVMS requirements of this clause as follows:
                (1) For subcontracts with an estimated dollar value of $50M or more, the following subcontractors shall comply with the requirements of this clause.
                (Contracting Officer to insert names of subcontractors or subcontracted effort).
                
                
                
                
                (2) For subcontracts with an estimated dollar value of less than $50M, the following subcontractors shall comply with the requirements of this clause except for the requirement in paragraph (b), if applicable, to obtain compliance/validation.
                (Contracting Officer to insert names of subcontractors or subcontracted effort.)
                
                
                
                
                (g) If the contractor identifies a need to deviate from the agreed baseline by working against an Over Target Baseline (OTB) or Over Target Schedule (OTS), the contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a request for approval to begin implementation of an OTB or OTS. This request shall include a top-level projection of cost and/or schedule growth, whether or not performance variances will be retained, and a schedule of implementation for the reprogramming adjustment. The Government will approve or deny the request within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request. Failure of the Government to respond within this 30-day period constitutes approval of the request. Approval of the deviation request does not constitute a change, or the basis for a change, to the negotiated cost or price of this contract, or the estimated cost of any undefinitized contract actions.

                (b) If, at the time of award, the Contractor's EVMS has not been determined by the Cognizant Federal Agency to be compliant with the EVMS guidelines, or the Contractor does not have an existing cost/schedule control system that is compliant with the guidelines in the ANSI/EIA-748 Standard (current version at the time of ward), the Contractor shall apply the system to the contract and shall take timely action to implement its plan to be compliant with the guidelines. The Government will not formally validate/accept the Contractor's EVMS with respect to this contract. The use of the Contractor's EVMS for this contract does not imply Government acceptance of the Contractor's EVMS for application to future contracts. The Government will monitor compliance through routine surveillance.

              Instructions for responding to NASA Research Announcements.
              As prescribed in 1835.070(c), insert the following provision:
              
                Instructions for Responding to NASA Research Announcements (JUL 2016)
                (a) General. (1) Proposals received in response to a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) will be used only for evaluation purposes. NASA does not allow a proposal, the contents of which are not available without restriction from another source, or any unique ideas submitted in response to an NRA to be used as the basis of a solicitation or in negotiation with other organizations, nor is a pre-award synopsis published for individual proposals.
                (2) A solicited proposal that results in a NASA award becomes part of the record of that transaction and may be available to the public on specific request; however, information or material that NASA and the awardee mutually agree to be of a privileged nature will be held in confidence to the extent permitted by law, including the Freedom of Information Act.
                (3) NRAs contain programmatic information and certain requirements which apply only to proposals prepared in response to that particular announcement. These instructions contain the general proposal preparation information which applies to responses to all NRAs.

                (4) A contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement may be used to accomplish an effort funded in response to an NRA. NASA will determine the appropriate award instrument. Contracts resulting from NRAs are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the NASA FAR Supplement. A grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement resulting from NRAs are subject to policies and procedures outlined in the Guidebook for Proposers Responding to a NASA Funding Announcement, 2 CFR part 1800, 14 CFR part 1274, or other agreement policy. Any proposal from a large business concern that may result in the award of a contract, which exceeds $5,000,000 and has subcontracting possibilities should include a small business subcontracting plan in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.
                (Subcontract plans for contract awards below $5,000,000, will be negotiated after selection.)
                (5) NASA does not have mandatory forms or formats for responses to NRAs; however, it is requested that proposals conform to the guidelines in these instructions. NASA may accept proposals without discussion; hence, proposals should initially be as complete as possible and be submitted on the proposers' most favorable terms.
                (6) To be considered for award, a submission must, at a minimum, present a specific project within the areas delineated by the NRA; contain sufficient technical and cost information to permit a meaningful evaluation; be signed by an official authorized to legally bind the submitting organization; not merely offer to perform standard services or to just provide computer facilities or services; and not significantly duplicate a more specific current or pending NASA solicitation.
                (b) NRA-Specific Items. Several proposal submission items appear in the NRA itself: the unique NRA identifier; when to submit proposals; where to send proposals; number of copies required; and sources for more information. Items included in these instructions may be supplemented by the NRA.
                (c) The following information is needed to permit consideration in an objective manner. NRAs will generally specify topics for which additional information or greater detail is desirable. Each proposal copy shall contain all submitted material, including a copy of the transmittal letter if it contains substantive information.
                (1) Transmittal letter or prefatory material.(i) The legal name and address of the organization and specific division or campus identification if part of a larger organization;
                (ii) A brief, scientifically valid project title intelligible to a scientifically literate reader and suitable for use in the public press;
                (iii) Type of organization: e.g., profit, nonprofit, educational, small business, minority, women-owned, etc;
                (iv) Name and telephone number of the principal investigator and business personnel who may be contacted during evaluation or negotiation;
                (v) Identification of other organizations that are currently evaluating a proposal for the same efforts;
                (vi) Identification of the NRA, by number and title, to which the proposal is responding;
                (vii) Dollar amount requested, desired starting date, and duration of project;
                (viii) Date of submission; and
                (ix) Signature of a responsible official or authorized representative of the organization, or any other person authorized to legally bind the organization (unless the signature appears on the proposal itself).
                (2) Restriction on use and disclosure of roposal information. Information contained in proposals is used for evaluation purposes only. Offerors or quoters should, in order to maximize protection of trade secrets or other information that is confidential or privileged, place the following notice on the title page of the proposal and specify the information subject to the notice by inserting an appropriate identification in the notice. In any event, information contained in proposals will be protected to the extent permitted by law, but NASA assumes no liability for use and disclosure of information not made subject to the notice.
                Notice—Restriction on Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information
                The information (data) contained in [insert page numbers or other identification] of this proposal constitutes a trade secret and/or information that is commercial or financial and confidential or privileged. It is furnished to the Government in confidence with the understanding that it will not, without permission of the offeror, be used or disclosed other than for evaluation purposes; provided, however, that in the event a contract (or other agreement) is awarded on the basis of this proposal the Government shall have the right to use and disclose this information (data) to the extent provided in the contract (or other agreement). This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use or disclose this information (data) if obtained from another source without restriction.
                (3) Abstract. Include a concise (200-300 word if not otherwise specified in the NRA) abstract describing the objective and the method of approach.
                (4) Project description. (i) The main body of the proposal shall be a detailed statement of the work to be undertaken and should include objectives and expected significance; relation to the present state of knowledge; and relation to previous work done on the project and to related work in progress elsewhere. The statement should outline the plan of work, including the broad design of experiments to be undertaken and a description of experimental methods and procedures. The project description should address the evaluation factors in these instructions and any specific factors in the NRA. Any substantial collaboration with individuals not referred to in the budget or use of consultants should be described. Subcontracting significant portions of a research project is discouraged.
                (ii) When it is expected that the effort will require more than one year, the proposal should cover the complete project to the extent that it can be reasonably anticipated. Principal emphasis should be on the first year of work, and the description should distinguish clearly between the first year's work and work planned for subsequent years.
                (5) Management approach. For large or complex efforts involving interactions among numerous individuals or other organizations, plans for distribution of responsibilities and arrangements for ensuring a coordinated effort should be described.
                (6) Personnel. The principal investigator is responsible for supervision of the work and participates in the conduct of the research regardless of whether or not compensated under the award. A short biographical sketch of the principal investigator, a list of principal publications and any exceptional qualifications should be included. Omit social security number and other personal items which do not merit consideration in evaluation of the proposal. Give similar biographical information on other senior professional personnel who will be directly associated with the project. Give the names and titles of any other scientists and technical personnel associated substantially with the project in an advisory capacity. Universities should list the approximate number of students or other assistants, together with information as to their level of academic attainment. Any special industry-university cooperative arrangements should be described.
                (7) Facilities and equipment. (i) Describe available facilities and major items of equipment especially adapted or suited to the proposed project, and any additional major equipment that will be required. Identify any Government-owned facilities, industrial plant equipment, or special tooling that are proposed for use. Include evidence of its availability and the cognizant Government points of contact.
                (ii) Before requesting a major item of capital equipment, the proposer should determine if sharing or loan of equipment already within the organization is a feasible alternative. Where such arrangements cannot be made, the proposal should so state. The need for items that typically can be used for research and non-research purposes should be explained.
                (8) Proposed costs (U.S. proposals only). (i) Proposals should contain cost and technical parts in one volume: do not use separate “confidential” salary pages. As applicable, include separate cost estimates for salaries and wages; fringe benefits; equipment; expendable materials and supplies; services; domestic and foreign travel; ADP expenses; publication or page charges; consultants; subcontracts; other miscellaneous identifiable direct costs; and indirect costs. List salaries and wages in appropriate organizational categories (e.g., principal investigator, other scientific and engineering professionals, graduate students, research assistants, and technicians and other non-professional personnel). Estimate all staffing data in terms of staff-months or fractions of full-time.
                (ii) Explanatory notes should accompany the cost proposal to provide identification and estimated cost of major capital equipment items to be acquired; purpose and estimated number and lengths of trips planned; basis for indirect cost computation (including date of most recent negotiation and cognizant agency); and clarification of other items in the cost proposal that are not self-evident. List estimated expenses as yearly requirements by major work phases.
                (iii) Allowable costs are governed by FAR part 31 and the NASA FAR Supplement part 1831.
                (iv) Use of NASA funds—NASA funding may not be used for foreign research efforts at any level, whether as a collaborator or a subcontract. The direct purchase of supplies and/or services, which do not constitute research, from non-U.S. sources by U.S award recipients is permitted. Additionally, in accordance with the National Space Transportation Policy, use of a non-U.S. manufactured launch vehicle is permitted only on a no-exchange-of-funds basis.
                (9) Security. Proposals should not contain security classified material. If the research requires access to or may generate security classified information, the submitter will be required to comply with Government security regulations.
                (10) Current support. For other current projects being conducted by the principal investigator, provide title of project, sponsoring agency, and ending date.
                (11) Special matters. (i) Include any required statements of environmental impact of the research, human subject or animal care provisions, conflict of interest, or on such other topics as may be required by the nature of the effort and current statutes, executive orders, or other current Government-wide guidelines.

                (ii) Identify and discuss risk factors and issues throughout the proposal where they are relevant, and your approach to managing these risks.
                
                (iii) Proposers should include a brief description of the organization, its facilities, and previous work experience in the field of the proposal. Identify the cognizant Government audit agency, inspection agency, and administrative contracting officer, when applicable.
                (d) Renewal proposals. (1) Renewal proposals for existing awards will be considered in the same manner as proposals for new endeavors. A renewal proposal should not repeat all of the information that was in the original proposal. The renewal proposal should refer to its predecessor, update the parts that are no longer current, and indicate what elements of the research are expected to be covered during the period for which support is desired. A description of any significant findings since the most recent progress report should be included. The renewal proposal should treat, in reasonable detail, the plans for the next period, contain a cost estimate, and otherwise adhere to these instructions.
                (2) NASA may renew an effort either through amendment of an existing contract or by a new award.
                (e) Length. Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, effort should be made to keep proposals as brief as possible, concentrating on substantive material. Few proposals need exceed 15-20 pages. Necessary detailed information, such as reprints, should be included as attachments. A complete set of attachments is necessary for each copy of the proposal. As proposals are not returned, avoid use of “one-of-a-kind” attachments.
                (f) Joint proposals. (1) Where multiple organizations are involved, the proposal may be submitted by only one of them. It should clearly describe the role to be played by the other organizations and indicate the legal and managerial arrangements contemplated. In other instances, simultaneous submission of related proposals from each organization might be appropriate, in which case parallel awards would be made.
                (2) Where a project of a cooperative nature with NASA is contemplated, describe the contributions expected from any participating NASA investigator and agency facilities or equipment which may be required. The proposal must be confined only to that which the proposing organization can commit itself. “Joint” proposals which specify the internal arrangements NASA will actually make are not acceptable as a means of establishing an agency commitment.
                (g) Late proposals. Proposals or proposal modifications received after the latest date specified for receipt may be considered if a significant reduction in cost to the Government is probable or if there are significant technical advantages, as compared with proposals previously received.
                (h) Withdrawal. Proposals may be withdrawn by the proposer at any time before award. Offerors are requested to notify NASA if the proposal is funded by another organization or of other changed circumstances which dictate termination of evaluation.
                (i) Evaluation factors. (1) Unless otherwise specified in the NRA, the principal elements (of approximately equal weight) considered in evaluating a proposal are its relevance to NASA's objectives, intrinsic merit, and cost.
                (2) Evaluation of a proposal's relevance to NASA's objectives includes the consideration of the potential contribution of the effort to NASA's mission.
                (3) Evaluation of its intrinsic merit includes the consideration of the following factors of equal importance:
                (i) Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal or unique and innovative methods, approaches, or concepts demonstrated by the proposal.
                (ii) Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.
                (iii) The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, or key personnel critical in achieving the proposal objectives.
                (iv) Overall standing among similar proposals and/or evaluation against the state-of-the-art.
                (4) Evaluation of the cost of a proposed effort may include the realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost and available funds.
                (j) Evaluation techniques. Selection decisions will be made following peer and/or scientific review of the proposals. Several evaluation techniques are regularly used within NASA. In all cases proposals are subject to scientific review by discipline specialists in the area of the proposal. Some proposals are reviewed entirely in-house, others are evaluated by a combination of in-house and selected external reviewers, while yet others are subject to the full external peer review technique (with due regard for conflict-of-interest and protection of proposal information), such as by mail or through assembled panels. The final decisions are made by a NASA selecting official. A proposal which is scientifically and programmatically meritorious, but not selected for award during its initial review, may be included in subsequent reviews unless the proposer requests otherwise.
                (k) Selection for award. (1) When a proposal is not selected for award, the proposer will be notified. NASA will explain generally why the proposal was not selected. Proposers desiring additional information may contact the selecting official who will arrange a debriefing.

                (2) When a proposal is selected for award, negotiation and award will be handled by the procurement office in the funding installation. The proposal is used as the basis for negotiation. The contracting officer may request certain business data and may forward a model award instrument and other information pertinent to negotiation.
                (l) Additional guidelines applicable to foreign proposals and proposals including foreign participation. (1) NASA welcomes proposals from outside the U.S. However, foreign entities are generally not eligible for funding from NASA. Therefore, unless otherwise noted in the NRA, proposals from foreign entities should not include a cost plan unless the proposal involves collaboration with a U.S. institution, in which case a cost plan for only the participation of the U.S. entity must be included. Proposals from foreign entities and proposals from U.S. entities that include foreign participation must be endorsed by the respective government agency or funding/sponsoring institution in the country from which the foreign entity is proposing. Such endorsement should indicate that the proposal merits careful consideration by NASA, and if the proposal is selected, sufficient funds will be made available to undertake the activity as proposed.
                (2) All foreign proposals must be typewritten in English and comply with all other submission requirements stated in the NRA. All foreign proposals will undergo the same evaluation and selection process as those originating in the U.S. All proposals must be received before the established closing date. Those received after the closing date will be treated in accordance with paragraph (g) of this provision. Sponsoring foreign government agencies or funding institutions may, in exceptional situations, forward a proposal without endorsement if endorsement is not possible before the announced closing date. In such cases, the NASA sponsoring office should be advised when a decision on endorsement can be expected.
                (3) Successful and unsuccessful foreign entities will be contacted directly by the NASA sponsoring office. Copies of these letters will be sent to the foreign sponsor. Should a foreign proposal or a U.S. proposal with foreign participation be selected, NASA's Office of External Relations will arrange with the foreign sponsor for the proposed participation on a no-exchange-of-funds basis, in which NASA and the non-U.S. sponsoring agency or funding institution will each bear the cost of discharging their respective responsibilities.
                (4) Depending on the nature and extent of the proposed cooperation, these arrangements may entail:
                (i) An exchange of letters between NASA and the foreign sponsor; or
                (ii) A formal Agency-to-Agency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
                (m) Cancellation of NRA. NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this NRA and to cancel this NRA. NASA assumes no liability for canceling the NRA or for anyone's failure to receive actual notice of cancellation.

The Contractor is responsible for reviewing publication or dissemination of the data for conformance with laws and regulations governing its distribution, including intellectual property rights, export control, national security and other requirements, and to the extent the contractor receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of the contract which contain restrictive markings, for complying with such restrictive markings. Should the Contractor seek to publish or otherwise disseminate the final report, or any additional reports required by 1852.235-74 if applicable, as delivered to NASA under this contract, the Contractor may do so once NASA has completed its document availability authorization review, and availability of the report has been determined.
              
              
              
                Alternate I (FEB 2003) As prescribed by 1835.070(d)(1), insert the following as paragraph (e) of the basic clause:
              
              
                (e) The data resulting from this research activity is “fundamental research” which will be broadly shared within the scientific community. No foreign national access or dissemination restrictions apply to this research activity. The Contractor may publish, release, or otherwise disseminate data produced during the performance of this contract, including the final report, without prior review by NASA for export control or national security purposes. However, NASA retains the right to review the final report to ensure that proprietary information, which may have been provided to the Contractor, is not released without authorization and for consistency with NASA publication standards. Additionally, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing any publication, release, or dissemination of the data for conformance with other restrictions expressly set forth in this contract, and to the extent it receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of the contract which contain restrictive markings, for compliance with such restrictive markings.
              
              
              
                Alternate II (DEC 2005) As prescribed by 1835.070(d)(2), insert the following as paragraph (e) of the basic clause:
              
              
                (e) Data resulting from this research activity may be subject to export control, national security restrictions or other restrictions designated by NASA; or, to the extent the Contractor receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of the contract which contain restrictive markings, may include proprietary information of others. Therefore, the Contractor shall not publish, release, or otherwise disseminate, except to NASA, data produced during the performance of this contract, including data contained in the final report and any additional reports required by 1852.235-74 when included in the contract, without prior review by NASA. Should the Contractor seek to publish, release, or otherwise disseminate data produced during the performance of this contract, the Contractor may do so once NASA has completed its document availability authorization review and the availability of the data has been determined.

                (f) All publications of any material based on or developed under NASA sponsored projects shall include an acknowledgement similar to the following:
                

                “The material is based upon work supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under Contract Number XXXX.”
                

                Except for articles or papers published in scientific, technical or professional journals, the exposition of results from NASA supported research shall also include the following disclaimer:
                
                “Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.”

                Additional Reports of Work—Research and Development (FEB 2003)
                In addition to the final report required under this contract, the Contractor shall submit the following report(s) to the Contracting Officer:
                (a) Monthly progress reports. The Contractor shall submit separate monthly reports of all work accomplished during each month of contract performance. Reports shall be in narrative form, brief, and informal. They shall include a quantitative description of progress, an indication of any current problems that may impede performance, proposed corrective action, and a discussion of the work to be performed during the next monthly reporting period.
                (b) Quarterly progress reports. The Contractor shall submit separate quarterly reports of all work accomplished during each three-month period of contract performance. In addition to factual data, these reports should include a separate analysis section interpreting the results obtained, recommending further action, and relating occurrences to the ultimate objectives of the contract. Sufficient diagrams, sketches, curves, photographs, and drawings should be included to convey the intended meaning.
                (c) Submission dates. Monthly and quarterly reports shall be submitted by the 15th day of the month following the month or quarter being reported. If the contract is awarded beyond the middle of a month, the first monthly report shall cover the period from award until the end of the following month. No monthly report need be submitted for the third month of contract effort for which a quarterly report is required. No quarterly report need be submitted for the final three months of contract effort since that period will be covered in the final report. The final report shall be submitted within __ days after the completion of the effort under the contract.

                Additive or Deductive Items (MAR 1989)
                (a) The low bidder for purposes of award shall be the conforming responsible bidder offering the low aggregate amount for the first or base bid item, plus or minus (in order of priority listed in the Schedule) those additive or deductive bid items providing the most features of the work within the funds determined by the Government to be available before bids are opened. If addition of another bid item in the listed order of priority would make the award exceed those funds for all bidders, it shall be skipped and the next subsequent additive bid item in a lower amount shall be added for each bid if award on it can be made within the funds.
                (b) An example for one bid is an amount available of $100,000, a bidder's base bid of $85,000, and four successive additives of $10,000, $8,000, $6,000, and $4,000. In this example, the aggregate amount of the bid for purposes of award would be $99,000 for the base bid plus the first and fourth additives, the second and third additives being skipped because either of them would cause the aggregate bid to exceed $100,000.
                (c) All bids shall be evaluated on the basis of the same additive or deductive bid items. The listed order of priority must be followed only for determining the low bidder. After determination of the low bidder, award in the best interests of the Government may be made to that bidder on its base bid and any combination of its additive or deductive bid items for which funds are determined to be available at the time of the award, provided that award of the combination of bid items does not exceed the amount offered by any other conforming responsible bidder for the same combination of bid items.

                (b) If a modification to a bid based on unit prices that provides for a lump-sum adjustment to the total estimated cost is submitted, the application of the lump sum adjustment to each unit price in the bid must be stated. If it is not stated, the lump-sum adjustment shall be applied on a pro rata basis to every unit price in the bid.

                Release of Sensitive Information (JUN 2005)
                (a) As used in this clause, “sensitive information” refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.
                (b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.
                (c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:
                Mark the title page with the following legend:
                This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause, the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages [insert page numbers or other identification of pages].
                Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following legend:
                Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or document.
                (2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular information is “sensitive.” This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides, with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.
                (d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This clause obligates the service provider to do the following:
                (1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.
                (2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of performing the services specified in its contract.
                (3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and disclosure.
                (4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform services under its contract.
                (5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of the service provider's organization.
                (6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from unauthorized use and disclosure.

                (7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed in performing this contract.
                
                (8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any necessary corrective actions.
                (e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs substantially equivalent screening procedures.
                (f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.
                (g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of sensitive information.

                Denied Access to NASA Facilities (OCT 2015)
                (a)(1) The performance of this contract requires contractor employees of the prime contractor or any subcontractor, affiliate, partner, joint venture, or team member with which the contractor is associated, including consultants engaged by any of these entities, to have access to, physical entry into, and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NASA facility.
                (2) NASA may close and or deny contractor access to a NASA facility for a portion of a business day or longer due to any one of the following events:
                (i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103.
                (ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, unusually severe weather to include snow storms, tornadoes and hurricanes.
                (iii) Occupational safety or health hazards.
                (iv) Non-appropriation of funds by Congress.
                (v) Any other reason.
                (3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NASA facility, in part or in whole, to perform work required by the contract. Contractor personnel already present at a NASA facility during such events may be required to leave the facility.
                (b) In all instances where contractor employees are denied access or required to vacate a NASA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, which could include continuing on-site performance during the NASA facility closure period. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts by, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.
                (c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the local radio, television stations, NASA Web sites, other communications channels, for example contracting officer notification, that the NASA facility is accessible. Once accessible the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.
                (d) For the period that NASA facilities were not accessible to contractor employees, the contracting officer may—
                (1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NASA facility was not accessible;
                (2) Forego the work;
                (3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties; or
                (4) Consider properly documented requests for equitable adjustment, claim, or any other remedy pursuant to the terms and conditions of the contract.
                (e) Notification procedures of a NASA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, as follows:
                (1) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the local radio, television stations, NASA Web sites, other communications channels, for example contracting officer notification, for announcement of a NASA facility closure to include denial of access to the NASA facility. The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NASA facility closure to include denial of access to the NASA facility. The dismissal of NASA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NASA facility closure in which contractor employees are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NASA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NASA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.

                (2) NASA's Emergency Notification System (ENS). ENS is a NASA-wide Emergency Notification and Accountability System that provides NASA the ability to send messages, both Agency-related and/or Center-related, in the event of an emergency or emerging situation at a NASA facility. Notification is provided via multiple communication devices, e.g. Email, text, cellular, home/office numbers. The ENS provides the capability to respond to notifications and provide the safety status. Contractor employees may register for these notifications at the ENS Web site: http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/ops/nasaonly/ENSinformation.html.

Contractor implementation of reporting requirements under this clause shall include NASA approval of the definitions of the content of each reporting category and give due regard to the Contractor's established financial management information system.
                (b) Lower level detail used by the Contractor for its own management purposes to validate information provided to NASA shall be compatible with NASA requirements.
                (c) Reports shall be submitted in the number of copies, at the time, and in the manner set forth in the Schedule or as designated in writing by the Contractor Officer. Upon completion and acceptance by NASA of all contract line items, the Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor to submit Form 533 reports on a quarterly basis only, report only when changes in actual cost incur, or suspend reporting altogether.
                (d) The Contractor shall ensure that its Form 533 reports include accurate subcontractor cost data, in the proper reporting categories, for the reporting period.
                (e) If during the performance of this contract NASA requires a change in the information or reporting requirements specified in the Schedule, or as provided for in paragraph (a) or (c) of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall effect that change in accordance with the Changes clause of this contract.

                Equitable Adjustments (APR 1998)
                (a) The provisions of all other clauses contained in this contract which provide for an equitable adjustment, including those clauses incorporated by reference with the exception of the “Suspension of Work” clause (FAR 52.242-14), are supplemented as follows:
                Upon written request, the Contractor shall submit a proposal for review by the Government. The proposal shall be submitted to the contracting officer within the time limit indicated in the request or any extension thereto subsequently granted. The proposal shall provide an itemized breakdown of all increases and decreases in the contract for the Contractor and each subcontractor in at least the following detail: material quantities and costs; direct labor hours and rates for each trade; the associated FICA, FUTA, SUTA, and Workmen's Compensation Insurance; and equipment hours and rates.
                (b) The overhead percentage cited below shall be considered to include all indirect costs including, but not limited to, field and office supervisors and assistants, incidental job burdens, small tools, and general overhead allocations. “Commission” is defined as profit on work performed by others.

                (f) On proposals covering both increases and decreases in the amount of the contract, the application of the overhead, profit, and commission shall be on the net change in direct costs for the Contractor or the subcontractor performing the work.
                (g) After receipt of the Contractor's proposal, the contracting officer shall act within a reasonable period, provided that when the necessity to proceed with a change does not permit time to properly check the proposal, or in the event of a failure to reach an agreement on a proposal, the contracting officer may order the Contractor to proceed on the basis of the price being determined at the earliest practicable date. In such a case, the price shall not be more than the increase or less than the decrease proposed.

                Contractor Requests for Government-Furnished Property (AUG 2015)
                (a) The Contractor shall provide all property required for the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall not acquire or construct items of property to which the Government will have title under the provisions of this contract without the Contracting Officer's written authorization. Property which will be acquired as a deliverable end item as material or as a component for incorporation into a deliverable end item is exempt from this requirement. Property approved as part of the contract award or specifically required within the statement of work is exempt from this requirement.
                (b)(1) In the event the Contractor is unable to provide the property necessary for performance, and the Contractor requests provision of property by the Government, the Contractor's request shall—
                (i) Justify the need for the property;
                (ii) Provide the reasons why contractor-owned property cannot be used;
                (iii) Describe the property in sufficient detail to enable the Government to screen its inventories for available property or to otherwise acquire property, including applicable manufacturer, model, part, catalog, National Stock Number or other pertinent identifiers;
                (iv) Combine requests for quantities of items with identical descriptions and estimated values when the estimated values do not exceed $500,000 per unit; and
                (v) Include only a single unit when the acquisition or construction value equals or exceeds $500,000.
                (2) Contracting Officer authorization is required for items the Contractor intends to manufacture as well as those it intends to purchase.
                (3) The Contractor shall submit requests to the Contracting Officer no less than 30 days in advance of the date the Contractor would, should it receive authorization, acquire or begin fabrication of the item.
                (c) The Contractor shall maintain copies of Contracting Officer authorizations, appropriately cross-referenced to the individual property record, within its property management system.
                (d) Property furnished from Government excess sources is provided as-is, where-is. The Government makes no warranty regarding its applicability for performance of the contract or its ability to operate. Failure of property obtained from Government excess sources under this clause is insufficient reason for submission of requests for equitable adjustments discussed in the clause at FAR 52.245-1, Government Property, as incorporated in this contract.

                (i) If the Contractor determines that a suitable item is available from NASA supply inventory, it shall request the item using applicable Center procedures.
                (ii) If the Contractor determines that an item within NASA or Federal excess is suitable, it shall contact the Center Industrial Property Officer to arrange for transfer of the item from the identified source to the Contractor.
                (2) If the Contractor determines that the required property is not available from inventory or excess sources, the Contractor shall note the acquisition file with a list of sources reviewed and the findings regarding the lack of availability. If the required property is available, but unsuitable for use, the contractor shall document the rationale for rejection of available property. The Contractor shall retain appropriate cross-referenced documentary evidence of the outcome of those screening efforts as part of its property records system.

                (ii) The Contractor shall furnish a copy of each purchase order, prior to delivery by the vendor, to the installation central receiving area.
                (iii) The Contractor shall establish a record for Government titled property as required by FAR 52.245-1, as incorporated in this contract, and shall maintain that record until accountability is accepted by the Government.

                (iv) Contractor use of Government property at an off-site location and off-site subcontractor use requires advance approval of the Contracting Officer and notification of the Industrial Property Officer. The property shall be considered Government furnished and the Contractor shall assume accountability and financial reporting responsibility. The Contractor shall establish records and property control procedures and maintain the property in accordance with the requirements of FAR 52.245-1, Government Property (as incorporated in this contract), until its return to the installation.

                Financial Reporting of NASA Property in the Custody of Contractors (JAN 2017)
                (a) The Contractor shall submit annually a NASA Form (NF) 1018, NASA Property in the Custody of Contractors, in accordance with this clause, the instructions on the form and NFS subpart 1845.71, and any supplemental instructions for the current reporting period issued by NASA.
                (b)(1) Subcontractor use of NF 1018 is not required by this clause; however, the Contractor shall include data on property in the possession of subcontractors in the annual NF 1018.
                (2) The Contractor shall mail the original signed NF 1018 directly to the cognizant NASA Center Industrial Property Officer and a copy to the cognizant NASA Center Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Finance, unless the Contractor uses the NF 1018 Electronic Submission System (NESS) for report preparation and submission.
                (3) One copy shall be submitted (through the Department of Defense (DOD) Property Administrator if contract administration has been delegated to DOD) to the following address: [Insert name and address of appropriate NASA Center office.], unless the Contractor uses the NF 1018 Electronic Submission System (NESS) for report preparation and submission.
                (c)(1) The annual reporting period shall be from October 1 of each year through September 30 of the following year. The report shall be submitted in time to be received by October 31st. The information contained in these reports is entered into the NASA accounting system to reflect current asset values for agency financial statement purposes. Therefore, it is essential that required reports be received no later than October 31st.
                (2) Some activity may be estimated for the month in which the report is submitted, if necessary, to ensure the NF 1018 is received when due. However, contractors' procedures must document the process for developing these estimates based on planned activity such as planned purchases or NASA Form 533 (NF 533) Contractor Financial Management Report cost estimates. It should be supported and documented by historical experience or other corroborating evidence, and be retained in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.7, Contractor Records Retention. Contractors shall validate the reasonableness of the estimates and associated methodology by comparing them to the actual activity once that data is available, and adjust them accordingly. In addition, differences between the estimated cost and actual cost must be adjusted during the next reporting period. Contractors shall have formal policies and procedures, which address the validation of NF 1018 data, including data from subcontractors, and the identification and timely reporting of errors. The objective of this validation is to ensure that information reported is accurate and in compliance with the NASA FAR Supplement. If errors are discovered on NF 1018 after submission, the contractor shall contact the cognizant NASA Center Industrial Property Officer (IPO) within 30 days after discovery of the error to discuss corrective action.
                (3) In addition to an annual report, if at any time during performance of the contract, NASA-owned property in the custody of the contractor has a value of $10 million or more, the contractor shall also submit a report no later than the 21st of each month in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this clause.
                (4) The Contracting Officer may, in NASA's interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $25,000 or 5 percent of the amount of the contract, whichever is less, has been set aside, if the Contractor fails to submit annual NF 1018 reports in accordance with NFS subpart 1845.71, any monthly report in accordance with (c)(3) of this clause, and any supplemental instructions for the current reporting period issued by NASA. Such reserve shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that NASA has received the required reports. The withholding of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government right.
                (d) A final report shall be submitted within 30 days after disposition of all property subject to reporting when the contract performance period is complete in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) through (3) of this clause.

              Exceptions.
              To avoid potential conflicts of interest or the appearance of preferential treatment, it is the Broadcasting Board of Governors policy not to award contracts, purchase orders, grants or cooperative agreements to Government employees or their family members or business concerns owned or controlled by Government employees or their family members. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the Board Director or Board Procurement Executive and supported by written Findings and Determination. A contract with an employee for services may result in violation of the dual salary compensation statutes (5 U.S.C. 5533). Nothing in this paragraph is intended to render inapplicable the conflict of interest prohibition set out in 18 U.S.C. 208.

              To avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of preferential treatment, purchase orders, contracts, grants or cooperative agreements with former employees of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, or with firms in which former employees or their family members are known to have controlling interest, may be entered into within two years following separation from employment only with the written approval of the Board Director. A written justification shall be made a part of the file. The justification must address the issue of conflict of interest and conclude that it does not exist; or that in spite of its existence, the Board's ability to meet its mission would be seriously harmed without the award.

              1904.7001
              General.
              (a) Procurement requests will be prepared and submitted to the contracting office in accordance with Board procedures.
              (b) Except in unusual circumstances, the contracting office will not issue solicitations until an approved procurement request, containing a certification that funds are available, has been received. However, the contracting office may take all necessary actions up to the point of contract award prior to the receipt of the approved procurement request certifying that funds are available when:
              (1) Such action is necessary to meet critical program schedules;
              (2) It has been established that program authority has been issued and that funds to cover the acquisition will be available prior to the date set for contract award or contract modification;
              (3) A person at a level above the contracting officer authorizes such action prior to the issuance of the solicitation, and the contract file is properly documented; and
              (4) The solicitation document clearly indicates that the award is subject to the availability of funds.
              (c) The procurement request shall be assigned within the contracting office to an individual who, if not the contracting officer, will be responsible to the contracting officer for conducting the business aspects of the transaction. This individual shall review the request to ensure that it complies with the FAR and this Regulation and that the information contained in the request is in sufficient detail to prepare presolicitation and solicitation documents. The contracting officer, or other designated individual in the contracting office, shall discuss uncertain requirements or inconsistencies in the procurement request with the initiator of the request and obtain clarification prior to taking any further action.

              Definitions.
              The Board Procurement Executive, is designated the “debarring official” and the “suspending official” as defined in FAR 9.403 and is designated as the Board official authorized to make the decisions required in FAR 9.405(a), 9.405-1(b), 9.405-2, 9.406-1(c), and 9.407-1(d).

              (a) The Policy and Procedures Staff, Office of Contracts, shall be responsible for the maintenance and distribution of the GSA Consolidated List of Debarred, Suspended, and Ineligible Contractors. It will be coordinated with the Solicitation Mailing List and appropriate notations will be made on both lists, when additions or deletions are necessary. Contracting Officers shall notify the Policy and Procedures Staff, Office of Contracts, of their distribution needs and shall ensure the list is used effectively.
              (b) The Board Procurement Executive (or designee) is responsible for notifying GSA of the information required by FAR 9.404(b).

              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. Any officer of the Board who becomes aware of circumstances which may serve as a basis for a debarment, suspension, or ineligibility shall report the circumstances by memorandum to the Board Procurement Executive for consideration of debarment, suspension or ineligibility action.
              (b) Decision-making process. (1) Contractors shall be given the opportunity to submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and arguments in opposition to a proposed debarment or suspension. All rebuttals shall be addressed to the Board Procurement Executive. However, if a response to the proposed debarment or suspension is not received by the Board Procurement Executive within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice, the debarment or suspension shall become final.
              (2) If a contractor, or a representative, desires to present information and arguments in person to the Board Procurement Executive, an oral presentation will be held within 20 calendar days of receipt of the request, unless a longer period of time is requested by the contractor. Hearings will be held before a three-person fact-finding board composed of one member each from the Office of General Counsel and Congressional Liaison, the Bureau of Management, and the Office of Contracts, other than the initiating officer. The fact-finding board shall deliver written findings to the Board Procurement Executive (together with a transcription of the proceedings, if made) within 10 calendar days after the hearing. The findings shall resolve any facts in dispute based on a preponderance of the evidence presented and determine whether a cause for debarment or suspension exists.
              (c) Debarring/suspending official's decision. The debarring/suspending official's final decision shall be made in writing in accordance with FAR 9.406-3 and notice of the decision will be given in accordance with FAR 9.406-3. A copy of the notice shall be given to the affected agency component.

            1910.004-70
            Brand name products or equal.
            (a) General. Consistent with the policy stated in FAR 10.004(a)(2), the Broadcasting Board of Governors acquisitions will generally not be based on a specifically identified product or feature(s) thereof. However, under unusual circumstances such an approach may be used as described below.
            (b) Citing brand name products. Brand name or equal purchase descriptions shall cite all brand name products known to be acceptable and of current manufacture. If the use of a brand name or equal purchase description results in the purchase of an acceptable brand name product which was not listed as an “equal” product, a reference to that brand name product should be included in the purchase description for later acquisitions. If a brand name product is no longer applicable, the reference thereto shall be deleted from subsequent purchase description.
            (c) Specifying essential characteristics. (1) It is imperative that brand name or equal purchase descriptions specify each physical or functional characteristic of the product that is essential to the intended use. Failure to do so may result in a defective solicitation and the necessity to resolicit the requirements. (See 1910.004-73.) Care must be taken to avoid specifying characteristics that cannot be shown to materially affect the intended end use and which unnecessarily restrict competition.
            (2) When describing essential characteristics, permissible tolerances should be indicated. Avoid specifying a characteristic (e.g., a specific dimension) of a brand name product unless it is essential to the Government's need. The contracting officer must be able to justify the requirement.
          
          
            1910.004-71
            Limits on the use of brand name or equal purchase descriptions.
            (a) General. The use of brand name or equal purchase descriptions in solicitations is intended to promote competition by encouraging the offering of products that are equal in all material respects to brand name products cited in such descriptions. Identification by brand name does not indicate a preference for the products mentioned but indicates the quality and characteristics of products that will meet the Government's needs. Where a component of an item is described in the solicitation by a brand name or equal purchase description and the contracting officer determines that application of the provision of 1952.210-70 would be impracticable, the requirement to include the entry described in 1910.004-72(a) shall not apply. If the provision is included in the solicitation for other reasons, there also shall be included in the solicitation a statement to identify either the component parts (described by brand name or equal descriptions) to which the provision applies or those to which it does not apply. This also applies to accessories related to an end item where a brand name or equal purchase description of the accessories is a part of the description of an end item. Brand name or equal descriptions shall not be used to acquire a particular product under the guise of competitive acquisition to the exclusion of other products that would meet the actual needs.
            (b) In small purchases within the open market limitations, brand name policies and procedures shall be applicable to the extent practicable.
            (c) Approval required. A brand name or equal purchase description shall not be used unless it has been approved at one level above the contracting officer.
          
          
            1910.004-72
            Solicitations, brand name or equal descriptions.

            (a) An entry substantially as follows shall be prominently inserted in the item listing after each item or component part of an end item to which a brand name or equal purchase description applies.
            
            
              Bidding on:
              
              Manufacturer's Name:
              Brand:
              No.:
            
            

            (b) Because bidders frequently overlook the requirements of the clause at 1952.210-70 “Brand Name or Equal,” the following note shall be inserted in the item listing after each brand name or equal item (or component part), or at the bottom of each page, listing several such items, or in a manner that may otherwise direct the offeror's attention to this clause.
            
            
              Offerors offering other than brand name items identified herein should furnish with their offers adequate information to ensure that a determination can be made as to equality of the product(s) offered (see the provision “Brand Name or Equal” set forth in 1952.210-70 of the solicitation).
            
            
            (c) If offeror samples are requested for brand name or equal acquisitions, the above notice shall not be included in the solicitation.
          
          
            1910.004-73
            Offer evaluation and award, brand name or equal descriptions.
            An offer may not be rejected for failure of the offered product to equal a characteristic of a brand name product if it was not specified in the brand name or equal description. However, if it is clearly established that the unspecified characteristic is essential to the intended end use, the solicitation is defective and no award may be made. In such cases, the contracting officer should resolicit the requirements, using a purchase description that sets forth the essential characteristics.
          
          
            1910.004-74
            Procedure for negotiated procurements and small purchases.
            (a) The policies and procedures prescribed for sealed bid procurements shall be generally applicable to negotiated procurements.
            (b) The clause set forth at 1952.210-70 may be adapted for use in negotiated procurements. If use of the clause is not practicable (as may be the case in unusual and compelling urgency purchases), suppliers shall be suitably informed that proposals offering products different from the products referenced by brand name will be considered if the contracting officer determines that the offered products meet fully the salient characteristics requirements of the solicitation.
            (c) In small purchases within open-market limitations, such policies and procedures shall be applicable to the extent practicable.
          
          
            1910.011
            Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.
            The Contracting Officer shall include the provision at 1952.210-70, Brand Name or Equal, in solicitations for which brand name or equal purchase is used.

              2001.101
              Purpose.
              This subpart establishes Chapter 20, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR), and provides for the codification and publication of uniform policies and procedures for acquisitions by the NRC. The NRCAR is not, by itself, a complete document. It must be used in conjunction with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1).
            
            
              2001.102
              Authority.
              The NRCAR and the amendments to it are issued by the Senior Procurement Executive under a delegation from the Executive Director for Operations dated May 16, 1997, in accordance with the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42. U.S.C. 161), the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5841, 5872), the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), as amended, FAR subpart 1.3, and other applicable law.
            
            
              2001.103
              Applicability.
              The FAR and NRCAR apply to all NRC acquisitions of supplies and services which obligate appropriated funds, unless exempted by Sections 31 and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended, and Section 205 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 as amended. For procurements made from nonappropriated funds, the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, shall determine the rules and procedures that apply.

              2001.104-1
              Publication and code arrangement.
              (a) The NRCAR and its subsequent changes are:
              (1) Published in the daily issue of the Federal Register; and
              (2) Codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
              (b) The NRCAR is issued as 48 CFR chapter 20.
            
            
              2001.104-2
              Arrangement of the regulations.
              (a) General. Chapter 20 is divided into parts, subparts, sections, subsections, paragraphs, and further subdivisions as necessary.
              (b) Numbering. The numbering system and part, subpart and section titles used in this Chapter conform with those used in the FAR as follows:
              
              (1) Where Chapter 20 implements the FAR or supplements a parallel part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph of the FAR, that implementation or supplementation is numbered and captioned to the FAR part, subpart, section, or subsection being implemented or supplemented, except that the implementation or supplementation is preceded with a 20 or 200 so that there will always be four numbers to the left of the decimal. For example, NRC's implementation of FAR 1.104-1 is shown as 2001.104-1 and the NRC's implementation of FAR 24.1 is shown as 2024.1.
              (2) When the NRC supplements material contained in the FAR, it is given a unique number containing the numerals “70” or higher. The rest of the number parallels the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph it is supplementing. For example, Section 170A of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, requires a more comprehensive organizational conflict of interest review for NRC than is contemplated by FAR 9.5. This supplementary material is identified as 2009.570.
              (3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or supplementation, there is no corresponding numbering in the NRCAR. Therefore, there may be gaps in the NRCAR sequence of numbers where the FAR requires no further implementation.
              (c) Citation. The NRCAR will be cited in accordance with Office of the Federal Register standards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section when referred to in the NRCAR is cited as 2001.104-2(c). When this section is referred to formally in official documents, such as legal briefs, it should be cited as “48 CFR 2001.104-2(c).” Any section of the NRCAR may be formally identified by the section number, e.g., “NRCAR 2001.104-2.” In the NRCAR, any reference to the FAR will be indicated by “FAR” followed by the section number, for example FAR 1-104.
            
            
              2001.104-3
              Copies.
              Copies of the NRCAR in Federal Register and CFR form may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.

            Subpart 2001.3—Agency Acquisition Regulations
            
              2001.301
              Policy.
              Policy, procedures, and guidance of an internal nature will be promulgated through internal NRC issuances such as Management Directives or Division of Contracts and Property Management Instructions.
            
            
              
              2001.303
              Public participation.
              FAR 1.301 and section 22 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 418b) require rulemaking for substantive acquisition rules, but allow discretion in the matter for other than significant issues meeting the stated criteria. Accordingly, the NRCAR has been promulgated and may be revised from time to time in accordance with FAR 1.301. This procedure for significant subject matter generally involves issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking that invites public comment, review and analysis of comments received, and publication of a final rule. The final rule includes a discussion of the public comments received and describes any changes made as a result of the comments.
            
          
          
            Subpart 2001.4—Deviations From the FAR and the NRCAR
            
              2001.402
              Policy.
              (a) Deviations from the provisions of the FAR or NRCAR may be granted as specified in this subpart when necessary to meet the specific needs of the requesting office. The development and testing of new techniques and methods of acquisition should not be discouraged simply because the action would require a FAR or NRCAR deviation.
              (b) Requests for authority to deviate from the provisions of the FAR or the NRCAR must be signed by the requesting office and submitted to the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, in writing, as far in advance as possible. Each request for deviation must contain the following:
              (1) A statement of the deviation desired, including identification of the specific paragraph number(s) of the FAR or NRCAR from which a deviation is requested;
              (2) The reason why the deviation is considered necessary or would be in the best interest of the Government;
              (3) If applicable, the name of the contractor and identification of the contract affected;
              (4) A description of the intended effect of the deviation;
              (5) A statement of the period of time for which the deviation is needed; and
              (6) Any pertinent background information which will contribute to a full understanding of the desired deviation.
            
            
              2001.403
              Individual deviations.
              In individual cases, deviations from either the FAR or the NRCAR will be authorized only when essential to effect only one contracting action or where special circumstances make the deviations clearly in the best interest of the Government. Individual deviations must be authorized in advance by the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management.
            
            
              2001.404
              Class deviations.
              Class deviations affect more than one contracting action. Where deviations from the FAR or NRCAR are considered necessary for classes of contracts, requests for authority to deviate must be submitted in writing to the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, who will consider the submission jointly with the Chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, as appropriate.
            
          
          
            Subpart 2001.6—Contracting Authority and Responsibilities
            
              2001.600-70
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart deals with the placement of contracting authority and responsibility within the agency, the selection and designation of contracting officers, and the authority of contracting officers.
            
            
              2001.601
              General.

              (a) Contracting authority vests in the Chairman. The Chairman has delegated this authority to the Executive Director for Operations (EDO). The EDO has delegated this authority to the Deputy Executive Director for Management Services (DEDM). The DEDM has delegated this authority to the Director, Office of Administration (ADM). The Director, ADM, has delegated the authority to the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management (DCPM), who, in turn, makes contracting officer appointments within Headquarters and Regional Offices. All of these delegations are formal written delegations containing dollar limitations and conditions.
              (b) The Director, Division of Contracts Division of Contracts and Property Management, establishes contracting policy throughout the agency; monitors the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the agency's contracting office; establishes controls to assure compliance with laws, regulations, and procedures; and delegates contracting officer authority.
            
            
              2001.602-3
              Ratification of unauthorized commitments.
              (a) The Government is not bound by agreements or contractual commitments made to prospective contractors by persons to whom contracting authority has not been delegated. Any unauthorized commitment may be in violation of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, other Federal laws, the FAR, the NRCAR, and good acquisition practice. Certain requirements of law and regulation necessary for the proper establishment of a contractual obligation may not be met under an unauthorized commitment; for example, the certification of the availability of funds, justification for other than full and open competition, competition of sources, determination of contractor responsibility, certification of current pricing data, price/cost analysis, administrative approvals, and negotiation of appropriate contract clauses.
              (b) The execution of otherwise proper contracts made by individuals without contracting authority, or by contracting officers in excess of the limits of their delegated authority, may later be ratified. To be effective, the ratification must be in the form of a written procurement document clearly stating that ratification of a previously unauthorized commitment is intended. All ratifications of procurement actions valued at $2,500 or less may be approved by the appropriate regional administrator or Headquarters contracting officer. For any such action, all other terms of subpart 2001.6 are applicable. All ratification actions exceeding $2,500 shall be approved by the Competition Advocate.
              (c) Requests received by contracting officers for ratification of commitments made by personnel lacking contracting authority must be processed as follows:
              (1) The Designating Official that is responsible for the office request shall furnish the contracting officer all records and documents concerning the commitment and a complete written statement of facts, including, but not limited to:
              (i) A written statement consistent with the complexity and size of the action as to why the contracting office was not used including the name of the employee who made the commitment;
              (ii) A statement as to why the proposed contractor was selected;
              (iii) A list of other sources considered;
              (iv) A description of work performed, or to be performed, or products to be furnished;
              (v) The estimated or agreed upon contract price;
              (vi) A certification of the appropriated funds available;
              (vii) A description of how unauthorized commitments in similar circumstances will be avoided in the future.
              (2) The contracting officer shall review the written statement of facts for a determination of approval of all actions valued at $2,500 or less. For actions greater than $2,500, the contracting officer shall forward the written statement of facts to the Competition Advocate through the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management with any comments or information that should be considered in evaluating the request for ratification.
              (3) The NRC legal advisor may be asked for an opinion, advice, or concurrence if there is concern regarding the propriety of the funding source, appropriateness of the expense, or when some other legal issue is involved.
            
            
              2001.603
              Selection, appointment, and termination of appointment.

              The Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, is authorized by the Director, Office of Administration, to select and appoint contracting officers and to terminate their appointment as prescribed in FAR 1.603.

              2009.100
              NRC policy.
              (a) It is NRC policy that only competitively awarded contracts shall be placed with an individual who was employed by the NRC within two years from the date of the Request for Procurement Action. This policy also applies to:
              (1) The noncompetitive award of contracts to organizations where former NRC employees have dominant ownership interests in the organization, such as partners or majority stockholders;
              (2) The noncompetitive award of contracts to organizations where former NRC employees have dominant management interests, such as principal officers, or where the organization is predominantly staffed by former NRC employees; and
              (3) The noncompetitive award of contracts, task orders or other NRC work assignments where the particular assignment is to be performed by designated former NRC employees, including principal investigators, key personnel, and others who will perform more than a nominal amount of the work in question.
              (b) The following procurement actions are considered noncompetitive for the purposes of this policy:

              (1) Contracts awarded noncompetitively under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Program;
              
              (2) Individual task orders if the former employee was not identified as “key personnel” in a proposal which was evaluated under competitive procedures;
              (3) Unsolicited proposals;
              (4) Subcontracts that require review for the purpose of granting consent under NRC prime contracts.
              (c) The term NRC employee includes special Government employees performing services for NRC as experts, advisors, consultants, or members of advisory committees, if—
              (1) The contract arises directly out of the individual's activity as a special employee;
              (2) The individual is in a position to influence the award of the contract; or
              (3) The Contracting Officer determines that another conflict of interest exists.
              (d) A justification explaining why it is in the best interest of the Government to contract with an individual or firm described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section on a noncompetitive basis may be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive after consulting with the Executive Director for Operations. This is in addition to any justification and approvals which may be required by the FAR for use of other than full and open competition.
              (e) Nothing in this policy statement relieves former employees from obligations prescribed by law, such as 18 U.S.C. 207, Restrictions on Former Officers, Employees, and Elected Officials of the Executive and Legislative Branches.

              Contract provisions.
              The contracting officer shall insert the following provisions in all solicitations:
              (a) Section 2052.209-70 Current/Former Agency Employee Involvement.

              2009.403
              Definitions.
              As used in 2009.4:
              
                Debarring official means the Senior Procurement Executive.
              
                Suspending official means the Senior Procurement Executive.

              Consolidated list of parties excluded from Federal procurement or non-procurement programs.
              The contracting officer responsible for the contract affected by the debarment or suspension shall perform the actions required by FAR 9.404(c) (1) through (6).
            
            
              2009.405
              Effect of listing.
              Compelling reasons are considered to be present where failure to contract with the debarred or suspended contractor would seriously harm the agency's programs and prevent accomplishment of mission requirements. The Senior Procurement Executive is authorized to make the determinations under FAR 9.405. Requests for these determinations must be submitted from the Head of the Contracting Activity, through the Director, Office of Administration, to the Senior Procurement Executive.
            
            
              2009.405-1
              Continuation of current contracts.
              The Head of the Contracting Activity is authorized to make the determination to continue contracts or subcontracts in existence at the time the contractor was debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment in accordance with FAR 9.405-1.
            
            
              2009.405-2
              Restrictions on subcontracting.
              The Head of the Contracting Activity is authorized to approve subcontracts with debarred or suspended subcontractors under FAR 9.405-2.

              2009.406-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. (1) When a contracting officer becomes aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be sufficient cause for debarment, the contracting officer must first submit a complete statement of facts (including a copy of any criminal indictments, if applicable) and a recommendation for action to the Head of the Contracting Activity. If the contracting officer's statement of facts indicates misconduct on the part of the contractor in regard to an NRC contract, the Head of the Contracting Activity will refer the matter of misconduct to the Inspector General to determine if an investigation is required prior to referring the case to the debarring official.
              (2) To the extent the Head of the Contracting Activity believes that sufficient grounds for debarment exist, independent of any pending investigation by the Inspector General, the Head of the Contracting Activity shall immediately forward the case, without reference to any pending investigation, and a recommendation for action to the Senior Procurement Executive for review. In such circumstances, the Head of the Contracting Activity will take no additional action in regard to a specific matter of misconduct referred to the Inspector General prior to consulting with the Inspector General.
              (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations and consulting with the Office of the General Counsel and, if appropriate, the Office of the Inspector General, the debarring official determines debarment is justified, the debarring official shall initiate the proposed debarment in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and notify the Head of the Contracting Activity of the action taken. If the contractor fails to submit a timely written response within 30 days after receipt of the notice in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c)(4), the debarring official may notify the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(d) that the contractor is debarred.
              (c) Fact-finding proceedings. For actions listed under FAR 9.406-3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an informal hearing. The hearing should be held at a location and time that is convenient to the parties concerned and no later than 30 days after the contractor received the notice, if at all possible. The contractor and any specifically named affiliates may be represented by counsel or any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either party. The proceedings must be conducted expeditiously and in such a manner that each party will have an opportunity to present all information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment.

              2009.407-3
              Procedures.
              (a) Investigation and referral. (1) When a contracting officer becomes aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be sufficient cause for suspension, the contracting officer must first submit a complete statement of facts (including a copy of any criminal indictments, if applicable) and a recommendation for action to the Head of the Contracting Activity. If the contracting officer's statement of facts indicates misconduct on the part of the contractor in regard to an NRC contract, the Head of the Contracting Activity will refer the matter of misconduct to the Inspector General to determine if an investigation is required prior to referring the case to the suspension official.
              (2) To the extent the Head of the Contracting Activity believes that sufficient grounds for debarment exist, independent of any pending investigation by the Inspector General, the Head of the Contracting Activity shall immediately forward the case, without reference to any pending investigation, and a recommendation for action to the Senior Procurement Executive for review. In such circumstances, the Head of the Contracting Activity will take no additional action in regard to a specific matter of misconduct referred to the Inspector General prior to consulting with the Inspector General.
              (b) Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations and consulting with the Office of the General Counsel, and if appropriate, the Office of the Inspector General, the suspending official determines suspension is justified, the suspending official shall initiate the proposed suspension in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(b)(2). The contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an informal hearing, similar in nature to the hearing for debarments as discussed in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2). If the contractor fails to submit a timely written response within 30 days after receipt of the notice in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(c)(5), the suspending official may notify the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.407-3(d) that the contractor is suspended.
            
            
              
              2009.470
              Appeals.
              A debarred or suspended contractor may appeal the debarring/suspending official's decision by mailing or otherwise furnishing a written notice within 90 days from the date of the decision to the Executive Director for Operations. A copy of the notice of appeal must be furnished to the debarring/suspending official.
            
          
          
            Subpart 2009.5—Organizational Conflicts of Interest
            
              2009.500
              Scope of subpart.
              In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2210a., NRC acquisitions are processed in accordance with 2009.570, which takes precedence over FAR 9.5 with respect to organizational conflicts of interest. Where non-conflicting guidance appears in FAR 9.5, that guidance must be followed.
            
            
              2009.570
              NRC organizational conflicts of interest.
            
            
              2009.570-1
              Scope of policy.
              (a) It is the policy of NRC to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize contractor organizational conflicts of interest. The NRC achieves this objective by requiring all prospective contractors to submit information describing relationships, if any, with organizations or persons (including those regulated by the NRC) which may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest in the event of contract award.
              (b) Contractor conflict of interest determinations cannot be made automatically or routinely. The application of sound judgment on virtually a case-by-case basis is necessary if the policy is to be applied to satisfy the overall public interest. It is not possible to prescribe in advance a specific method or set of criteria which would serve to identify and resolve all of the contractor conflict of interest situations that might arise. However, examples are provided in the regulations in this chapter to guide application of this policy guidance. The ultimate test is as follows: Might the contractor, if awarded the contract, be placed in a position where its judgment may be biased, or where it may have an unfair competitive advantage?
              (c) The conflict of interest rule contained in this subpart applies to contractors and offerors only. Individuals or firms who have other relationships with the NRC (e.g., parties to a licensing proceeding) are not covered by the regulations in this chapter. This rule does not apply to the acquisition of consulting services through the personnel appointment process. NRC agreements with other Govern ment agencies, international organizations, or state, local, or foreign Governments. Separate procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest will be employed in these agreements, as appropriate.
            
            
              2009.570-2
              Definitions.
              
                Affiliates means business concerns which are affiliates of each other when either directly or indirectly one concern or individual controls or has the power to control another, or when a third party controls or has the power to control both.
              
                Contract means any contractual agreement or other arrangement with the NRC except as provided in 2009.570-1(c).
              
                Contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, affiliates thereof, or their successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors, key personnel (identified in the contract), proposed consultants or subcontractors, which are a party to a contract with the NRC.
              
                Evaluation activities means any effort involving the appraisal of a technology, process, product, or policy.
              
                Offeror or prospective contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, or their affiliates or successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors, key personnel, proposed consultants, or subcontractors, submitting a bid or proposal, solicited or unsolicited, to the NRC to obtain a contract.
              
                Organizational conflicts of interest means that a relationship exists whereby a contractor or prospective contractor has present or planned interests related to the work to be performed under an NRC contract which:

              (1) May diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, objective assistance and advice, or may otherwise result in a biased work product; or
              (2) May result in its being given an unfair competitive advantage.
              
                Potential conflict of interest means that a factual situation exists that suggests that an actual conflict of interest may arise from award of a proposed contract. The term potential conflict of interest is used to signify those situations that—
              (1) Merit investigation before contract award to ascertain whether award would give rise to an actual conflict; or
              (2) Must be reported to the contracting officer for investigation if they arise during contract performance.
              
                Research means any scientific or technical work involving theoretical analysis, exploration, or experimentation.
              
                Subcontractor means any subcontractor of any tier who performs work under a contract with the NRC except subcontracts for supplies and subcontracts in amounts not exceeding $10,000.
              
                Technical consulting and management support services means internal assistance to a component of the NRC in the formulation or administration of its programs, projects, or policies which normally require that the contractor be given access to proprietary information or to information that has not been made available to the public. These services typically include assistance in the preparation of program plans, preliminary designs, specifications, or statements of work.
            
            
              2009.570-3
              Criteria for recognizing contractor organizational conflicts of interest.
              (a) General. (1) Two questions will be asked in determining whether actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist:
              (i) Are there conflicting roles which might bias an offeror's or contractor's judgment in relation to its work for the NRC?
              (ii) May the offeror or contractor be given an unfair competitive advantage based on the performance of the contract?
              (2) NRC's ultimate determination that organizational conflicts of interest exist will be made in light of common sense and good business judgment based upon the relevant facts. While it is difficult to identify and to prescribe in advance a specific method for avoiding all of the various situations or relationships that might involve potential organizational conflicts of interest, NRC personnel will pay particular attention to proposed contractual requirements that call for the rendering of advice, consultation or evaluation activities, or similar activities that directly lay the groundwork for the NRC's decisions on regulatory activities, future procurements, and research programs. Any work performed at an applicant or licensee site will also be closely scrutinized by the NRC staff.
              (b) Situations or relationships. The following situations or relationships may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest:
              (1) The offeror or contractor shall disclose information that may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest under the following circumstances. The information may include the scope of work or specification for the requirement being performed, the period of performance, and the name and telephone number for a point of contact at the organization knowledgeable about the commercial contract.
              (i) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice and recommendations to the NRC in the same technical area where it is also providing consulting assistance to any organization regulated by the NRC.
              (ii) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice to the NRC on the same or similar matter on which it is also providing assistance to any organization regulated by the NRC.
              (iii) Where the offeror or contractor evaluates its own products or services, or has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of the products or services of another entity.

              (iv) Where the award of a contract would result in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased in relation to its work for the NRC, or would result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
              
              (v) Where the offeror or contractor solicits or performs work at an applicant or licensee site while performing work in the same technical area for the NRC at the same site.
              (2) The contracting officer may request specific information from an offeror or contractor or may require special contract clauses such as provided in 2009.570-5(b) in the following circumstances:
              (i) Where the offeror or contractor prepares specifications that are to be used in competitive procurements of products or services covered by the specifications.
              (ii) Where the offeror or contractor prepares plans for specific approaches or methodologies that are to be incorporated into competitive procurements using the approaches or methodologies.
              (iii) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to information not available to the public concerning NRC plans, policies, or programs that could form the basis for a later procurement action.
              (iv) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to proprietary information of its competitors.
              (v) Where the award of a contract might result in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased in relation to its work for the NRC or might result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
              (c) Policy application guidance. The following examples are illustrative only and are not intended to identify and resolve all contractor organizational conflict of interest situations.
              (1)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a Request For Proposal (RFP), proposes to undertake certain analyses of a reactor component as called for in the RFP. The ABC Corp. is one of several companies considered to be technically well qualified. In response to the inquiry in the RFP, the ABC Corp. advises that it is currently performing similar analyses for the reactor manufacturer.
              (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work normally would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. because the company would be placed in a position in which its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. Because there are other well-qualified companies available, there would be no reason for considering a waiver of the policy.
              (2)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to an RFP, proposes to perform certain analyses of a reactor component that is unique to one type of advanced reactor. As is the case with other technically qualified companies responding to the RFP, the ABC Corp. is performing various projects for several different utility clients. None of the ABC Corp. projects have any relationship to the work called for in the RFP. Based on the NRC evaluation, the ABC Corp. is considered to be the best qualified company to perform the work outlined in the RFP.
              (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract normally could be awarded to the ABC Corp. because no conflict of interest exists which could motivate bias with respect to the work. An appropriate clause would be included in the contract to preclude the ABC Corp. from subsequently contracting for work with the private sector that could create a conflict during the performance of the NRC contract. For example, ABC Corp. would be precluded from the performance of similar work for the company developing the advanced reactor mentioned in the example.
              (3)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a competitive RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in revising NRC's guidance documents on the respiratory protection requirements of 10 CFR part 20. ABC Corp. is the only firm determined to be technically acceptable. ABC Corp. has performed substantial work for regulated utilities in the past and is expected to continue similar efforts in the future. The work has and will cover the writing, implementation, and administration of compliance respiratory protection programs for nuclear power plants.
              (ii) Guidance. This situation would place the firm in a role where its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. Because the nature of the required work is vitally important in terms of the NRC's responsibilities and no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy, in accordance with 2009.570-9 may be warranted. Any waiver must be fully documented in accordance with the waiver provisions of this policy with particular attention to the establishment of protective mechanisms to guard against bias.
              (4)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. submits a proposal for a new system to evaluate a specific reactor component's performance for the purpose of developing standards that are important to the NRC program. The ABC Corp. has advised the NRC that it intends to sell the new system to industry once its practicability has been demonstrated. Other companies in this business are using older systems for evaluation of the specific reactor component.
              (ii) Guidance. A contract could be awarded to the ABC Corp. if the contract stipulates that no information produced under the contract will be used in the contractor's private activities unless this information has been reported to the NRC. Data on how the reactor component performs, which is reported to the NRC by contractors, will normally be disseminated by the NRC to others to preclude an unfair competitive advantage. When the NRC furnishes information about the reactor component to the contractor for the performance of contracted work, the information may not be used in the contractor's private activities unless the information is generally available to others. Further, the contract will stipulate that the contractor will inform the NRC contracting officer of all situations in which the information, developed about the performance of the reactor component under the contract, is proposed to be used.
              (5)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, proposes to assemble a map showing certain seismological features of the Appalachian fold belt. In accordance with the representation in the RFP and 2009.570-3(b)(1)(i), ABC Corp. informs the NRC that it is presently doing seismological studies for several utilities in the eastern United States, but none of the sites are within the geographic area contemplated by the NRC study.
              (ii) Guidance. The contracting officer would normally conclude that award of a contract would not place ABC Corp. in a conflicting role where its judgment might be biased. Section 2052.209-72(c) Work for Others, would preclude ABC Corp. from accepting work which could create a conflict of interest during the term of the NRC contract.
              (6)(i) Example. AD Division of ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in the safety and environmental review of applications for licenses for the construction, operation, and decommissioning of fuel cycle facilities. ABC Corp. is divided into two separate and distinct divisions, AD and BC. The BC Division performs the same or similar services for industry. The BC Division is currently providing the same or similar services required under the NRC's contract for an applicant or licensee.
              (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. The AD Division could be placed in a position to pass judgment on work performed by the BC Division, which could bias its work for NRC. Further, the Conflict of Interest provisions apply to ABC Corp. and not to separate or distinct divisions within the company. If no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy could be sought in accordance with 2009.570-9.
              (7)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. completes an analysis for NRC of steam generator tube leaks at one of a utility's six sites. Three months later, ABC Corp. is asked by this utility to perform the same analysis at another of its sites.
              (ii) Guidance. Section 2052.290-72(c)(3) would prohibit the contractor from beginning this work for the utility until one year after completion of the NRC work at the first site.
              (8)(i) Example. ABC Corp. is assisting NRC in a major on-site analysis of a utility's redesign of the common areas between its twin reactors. The contract is for two years with an estimated value of $5 million. Near the completion of the NRC work, ABC Corp. requests authority to solicit for a $100K contract with the same utility to transport spent fuel to a disposal site. ABC Corp. is performing no other work for the utility.
              
              (ii) Guidance. The Contracting Officer would allow the contractor to proceed with the solicitation because it is not in the same technical area as the NRC work; and the potential for technical bias by the contractor because of financial ties to the utility is slight due to the relative value of the two contracts.
              (9)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. is constructing a turbine building and installing new turbines at a reactor site. The contract with the utility is for five years and has a total value of $100 million. ABC Corp. has responded to an NRC Request For Proposal requiring the contractor to participate in a major team inspection unrelated to the turbine work at the same site. The estimated value of the contract is $75K.
              (ii) Guidance. An NRC contract would not normally be awarded to ABC Corp. because these factors create the potential for financial loyalty to the utility that may bias the technical judgment of the contractor.
              (d) Other considerations. (1) The fact that the NRC can identify and later avoid, eliminate, or neutralize any potential organizational conflicts arising from the performance of a contract is not relevant to a determination of the existence of conflicts prior to the award of a contract.
              (2) It is not relevant that the contractor has the professional reputation of being able to resist temptations which arise from organizational conflicts of interest, or that a follow-on procurement is not involved, or that a contract is awarded on a competitive or a sole source basis.
            
            
              2009.570-4
              Representation.
              (a) The following procedures are designed to assist the NRC contracting officer in determining whether situations or relationships exist which may constitute organizational conflicts of interest with respect to a particular offeror or contractor. The procedures apply to small purchases meeting the criteria stated in the following paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) The organizational conflicts of interest representation provision at 2052.209-71 must be included in solicitations and contracts resulting from unsolicited proposals. The contracting officer must also include this provision for task orders and contract modifications for new work for:
              (1) Evaluation services or activities;
              (2) Technical consulting and management support services;
              (3) Research; and
              (4) Other contractual situations where special organizational conflicts of interest provisions are noted in the solicitation and would be included in the resulting contract. This representation requirement also applies to all modifications for additional effort under the contract except those issued under the “Changes” clause. Where, however, a statement of the type required by the organizational conflicts of interest representation provisions has previously been submitted with regard to the contract being modified, only an updating of the statement is required.
              (c) The offeror may, because of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work contained in a RFP unless the RFP specifically prohibits the exclusion. Any such proposed exclusion by an offeror will be considered by the NRC in the evaluation of proposals. If the NRC considers the proposed excluded work to be an essential or integral part of the required work and its exclusion would be to the detriment of the competitive posture of the other offerors, the NRC shall reject the proposal as unacceptable.
              (d) The offeror's failure to execute the representation required by paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an invitation for bids is considered to be a minor informality. The offeror will be permitted to correct the omission.
            
            
              2009.570-5
              Contract clauses.
              (a) General contract clause. All contracts and simplified acquisitions of the types set forth in 2009.570-4(b) must include the clause entitled, “Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest,” set forth in 2052.209-72.
              (b) Other special contract clauses. If it is determined from the nature of the proposed contract that an organizational conflict of interest exists, the contracting officer may determine that the conflict can be avoided, or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with 2009.570-9, neutralized through the use of an appropriate special contract clause. If appropriate, the offeror may negotiate the terms and conditions of these clauses, including the extent and time period of any restriction. These clauses include but are not limited to:
              (1) Hardware exclusion clauses which prohibit the acceptance of production contracts following a related non-production contract previously performed by the contractor;
              (2) Software exclusion clauses;
              (3) Clauses which require the contractor (and certain of its key personnel) to avoid certain organizational conflicts of interest; and
              (4) Clauses which provide for protection of confidential data and guard against its unauthorized use.
            
            
              2009.570-6
              Evaluation, findings, and contract award.
              The contracting officer shall evaluate all relevant facts submitted by an offeror and other relevant information. After evaluating this information against the criteria of 2009.570-3, the contracting officer shall make a finding of whether organizational conflicts of interest exist with respect to a particular offeror. If it has been determined that real or potential conflicts of interest exist, the contracting officer shall:
              (a) Disqualify the offeror from award;
              (b) Avoid or eliminate such conflicts by appropriate measures; or
              (c) Award the contract under the waiver provision of 2009.570-9.
            
            
              2009.570-7
              Conflicts identified after award.
              If potential organizational conflicts of interest are identified after award with respect to a particular contractor and the contracting officer determines that conflicts do exist and that it would not be in the best interest of the Government to terminate the contract, as provided in the clauses required by 2009.570-5, the contracting officer shall take every reasonable action to avoid, eliminate, or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with 2009.570-9, neutralize the effects of the identified conflict.
            
            
              2009.570-8
              Subcontracts.
              The contracting officer shall require offerors and contractors to submit a representation statement from all subcontractors (other than a supply subcontractor) and consultants performing services in excess of $10,000 in accordance with 2009.570-4(b). The contracting officer shall require the contractor to include contract clauses in accordance with 2009.570-5 in consultant agreements or subcontracts involving performance of work under a prime contract.
            
            
              2009.570-9
              Waiver.
              (a) The contracting officer determines the need to seek a waiver for specific contract awards with the advice and concurrence of the program office director and legal counsel. Upon the recommendation of the Senior Procurement Executive, and after consultation with legal counsel, the Executive Director for Operations may waive the policy in specific cases if he determines that it is in the best interest of the United States to do so.
              (b) Waiver action is strictly limited to those situations in which:
              (1) The work to be performed under contract is vital to the NRC program;
              (2) The work cannot be satisfactorily performed except by a contractor whose interests give rise to a question of conflict of interest.
              (3) Contractual and/or technical review and surveillance methods can be employed by the NRC to neutralize the conflict.
              (c) The justification and approval documents for any waivers must be placed in the NRC Public Document Room.
            
            
              2009.570-10
              Remedies.

              In addition to other remedies permitted by law or contract for a breach of the restrictions in this subpart or for any intentional misrepresentation or intentional nondisclosure of any relevant interest required to be provided for this section, the NRC may debar the contractor from subsequent NRC contracts.

              Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.
              (a) The contracting officer shall insert the following clauses in solicitations and contracts that are applicable to the requirement:
              (1) Section 2052.215-70, Key Personnel in applicable solicitations and contracts;
              (2)(i) Section 2052.215-71, Project Officer Authority in applicable solicitations and contracts for cost-reimbursement, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost sharing, labor-hour or time-and-materials, including task order contracts. This clause and the following alternate clauses are intended for experienced, trained project officers, and may be altered to delete duties where appropriate:
              (ii) Section 2052.215-71 Alternate 1. For solicitations for issuance of delivery orders for specific products/services;
              (iii) Section 2052.215-71 Alternate 2. For solicitations for firm fixed price contracts, with paragraph (b)(1) of Alternate 1 deleted and the remainder of the clause renumbered.
              (3) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 2052.215-72, Timely Receipt of Proposals in all solicitations;
              (4) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 2052.215-73, Award Notification and Commitment of Public Funds in all solicitations; and
              (5) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 2052.215-74, Disposition of Proposals in all solicitations.
              (b) The contracting officer may insert the following provisions in all solicitations as applicable. These provisions may be altered to fit the circumstances of the requirement. These provisions shall be tailored to assure that all sections of the instructions for the Technical and Management Proposal, or Oral Presentation and Supporting Documentation, reflect a one-to-one relationship to the evaluation criteria:
              (1) Section 2052.215-75, Proposal Presentation and Format for negotiated procurements for cost type contracts;
              (2) Section 2052.215-75 Alternate 1 may be used for all solicitations for negotiated task order contracts;
              (3) Section 2015.215-75 Alternate 2 may be used for all solicitations for negotiated fixed price, labor hour, or time and materials contracts:

              (d) The contracting officer shall insert the following clauses in solicitations and contracts as applicable:
              (1) Section 2052.215-77, Travel Approvals and Reimbursement, must be inserted in cost reimbursement solicitations and contracts which require travel but do not set a specific ceiling amount on that travel.

              (1) Section 2052.215-79 Contract Award and Evaluation of Proposals, shall be included in all solicitations where technical merit is more important than cost,

              (2) Section 2052.215-79 Alternate 1 must be included when proposals are to be evaluated on a lowest price, technically acceptable basis.

              2015.300
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart applies to all contracts awarded on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR part 15. This subpart does not apply to contracts awarded on a non-competitive basis to the Small Business Administration under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.
            
            
              2015.303
              Responsibilities.
              (a) The source selection authority is the contracting officer. The contracting officer, acting as the source selection authority, shall select an offer for award based on review of the Source Evaluation Panel's recommendation contained in the reports described in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (b) Any cancellation of solicitations and subsequent rejection of all proposals must be approved by the Head of the Contracting Activity.
              (c) For all proposed contracts with total estimated values in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and expected to result from competitive technical and price/cost negotiations, the cooperative review efforts of technical, contracting, and other administrative personnel are formalized through establishment of a Source Evaluation Panel. A single technical member may be appointed to the Source Evaluation Panel to evaluate proposals with the contracting officer's approval. In these instances, the Designating Official may appoint technical advisors (non-voting members) to assist the single technical member. The Source Evaluation Panel should not exceed five members, including the Chairperson except in unusual cases. The Source Evaluation Panel's proposal evaluation report(s) may include a Competitive Range Report and a Final Evaluation Report (to be used when award will be made after conducting discussions), or a Recommendation for Award Report (to be used when award will be made without discussions).
              (d) The Designating Official (Office Director or designee) is responsible for appointing a Source Evaluation Panel to evaluate competitive technical proposals in accordance with the solicitation technical criteria. The Designating Official is also responsible for conducting an independent review and evaluation of the Source Evaluation Panel's proposal evaluation report(s) to the contracting officer.
            
            
              2015.304
              Evaluation factors.
              The evaluation factors included in the solicitation serve as the standard against which all proposals are evaluated and are the basis for the development of proposal preparation instructions in accordance with FAR 15.304(b). The solicitation may indicate the relative importance of evaluation factors and subfactors by assigning a numerical weight to each factor. If a solicitation uses numerical weights, those weights shall be stated in the solicitation. The relative importance of factors that are not numerically weighted will be stated in the solicitation. Examples of factors which may not be numerically weighted are conflict of interest, estimated cost, and “go/no go” evaluation factors.
            
            
              2015.305
              Proposal evaluation.
              The contracting officer may provide offerors' cost proposals and supporting financial information to members of the Source Evaluation Panel at the same time technical proposals are distributed for evaluation. The Source Evaluation Panel shall use this information to perform an accurate integrated assessment of each offeror's proposal based on all the facts presented to them.

              2015.606-1
              Receipt and initial review.
              (a) The Division of Contracts and Property Management shall acknowledge receipt of an unsolicited proposal, complete a preliminary review, assign a docket number, and send copies of the unsolicited proposal to the appropriate program office Director(s) or designee for evaluation.
              (b) The Division of Contracts and Property Management shall be responsible for controlling reproduction and distribution of proposal material by notifying evaluators of their responsibilities and tracking the number of proposals received and forwarded to evaluators.
              (c) An acknowledgment letter will be sent to the proposer by The Division of Contracts and Property Management. The letter will provide an estimated date for a funding decision or identifying the reasons for non-acceptance of the proposal for review in accordance with FAR 15.606-1(b) and FAR 15.606-1(c).

              2042.570-1
              Policy.
              The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) policy is to support the contractor's expression of professional health and safety-related concerns associated with the contractor's work for the NRC that may differ from a prevailing NRC staff view, disagree with an NRC decision or policy position, or take issue with proposed or established agency practices. An occasion may arise when an NRC contractor, contractor's personnel, or subcontractor personnel believes that a conscientious expression of a competent judgement is required to document these concerns on matters directly associated with its performance of the contract. The procedure described in 2052.242-71, Procedures for Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views, provides for the expression and resolution of DPVs of health and safety-related concerns associated with the mission of the agency by NRC contractors, contractor personnel, or subcontractor personnel on matters directly associated with its performance of the contract. The contractor shall provide a copy of the NRC DPV procedure to all of its employees performing under this contract and to all subcontractors who shall, in turn, provide a copy of the procedure to its employees. The prime contractor or subcontractor shall submit all DPV's received but need not endorse them.

This clause may not be altered by the contracting officer.
              (b) The contracting officer shall include the clause at 2052.242-71, Procedures for Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views, as an attachment to cost reimbursement solicitations and contracts for professional services, as appropriate. This clause may not be altered by the contracting officer.

              2042.803
              Disallowing costs after incurrence.
              (a) Vouchers and invoices submitted to NRC must be submitted to the contracting officer or designee for review and approval for payment. If the examination of a voucher or invoice raises a question regarding the allowability of a cost submitted, the contracting officer or designee shall:
              (1) Hold informal discussions with the contractor as appropriate.
              (2) If the discussions do not resolve the matter, the contracting officer shall issue a notice advising the contractor of costs disallowed. The notice must advise the contractor that it may:
              (i) If in disagreement with the disallowance, submit a written claim to the contracting officer for payment of the disallowed cost and explain why the cost should be reimbursed; or

              (ii) If the disagreement(s) cannot be settled, file a claim under the disputes clause which will be processed in accordance with disputes procedures found at FAR subpart 33.2; and
              
              (3) Process the voucher or invoice for payment and advise the NRC Division of Accounting and Finance to deduct the disallowed costs when scheduling the voucher for payment.
              (b) When audit reports or other notifications question costs or consider them unallowable, the contracting officer shall resolve all cost issues through discussions with the contractor and/or auditor within six months of receipt of the audit report whenever possible.
              (1) One of the following courses of action must be pursued:
              (i) Accept and implement audit recommendations as submitted;
              (ii) Accept the principle of the audit recommendation but adjust the amount of the questioned costs;
              (iii) Reject audit findings and recommendations.
              (2) When implementing the chosen course of action, the contracting officer shall:
              (i) Hold discussions with the auditor and contractor, as appropriate;
              (ii) If the contracting officer agrees with the auditor concerning the questioned costs, attempt to negotiate a mutual settlement of questioned costs;
              (iii) Issue a final decision, including any disallowance of questioned costs; inform the contractor of his/her right to appeal the decision under the disputes procedures found at FAR subpart 33.2; and provide a copy of the final decision to the Office of the Inspector General; and
              (iv) Initiate immediate recoupment actions for all disallowed costs owed the Government by one or more of the following methods:
              (A) Request that the contractor provide a credit adjustment (offset) and an adequate description/explanation of the adjustment against amounts billed the Government on the next or other future invoice(s) submitted under the contract for which the disallowed costs apply;
              (B) Deduct the disallowed costs from the next invoice submitted under the contract;
              (C) Deduct the disallowed costs on a schedule determined by the contracting officer after discussion with the contractor (if the contracting officer determines that an immediate and complete deduction is inappropriate); and
              (D) Advise the contractor that a refund is immediately payable to the Government (in situations where there are insufficient payments owed by the Government to effect recovery from the contract).

              Providing Government property (in general).
              (a) Unless otherwise provided for in FAR 45.302-1(d), applicable to Government facilities with a unit cost of less than $10,000, a contractor may be provided Government property or allowed to purchase the property at Government expense if the contracting officer, with the advice of the agency property official determines that:
              (1) No practicable or economical alternative exists; e.g., acquisition from other sources, utilization of subcontractors, rental of property, or modification of program project requirements;
              (2) Furnishing Government property is likely to result in substantially lower costs to the Government for the items produced or services rendered when all costs involved (e.g., transportation, installation, modification, maintenance, etc.) are compared with the costs to the Government of the contractor's use of privately-owned property; and
              (3) The Government receives adequate consideration for providing the property.

              (b) The contractor shall send a copy of each Financial Status Report (NRCAR 2052.211-72, and 2052.211-72 Alternate 1), that references the acquisition of, or change in status of, contractor-held property purchased with government funds valued at the time of purchase at $50,000 or more to the Chief, Property and Acquisition Oversight Branch, Division of Contracts and Property Management.

              Security.
              As prescribed at 2004.404(a), the contracting officer shall insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts during which the contractor may have access to, or contact with classified information, including National Security information, restricted data, formerly restricted data, and other classified data:
              
                Security (OCT 1999)
                (a) Security/Classification Requirements Form. The attached NRC Form 187 (See List of Attachments) furnishes the basis for providing security and classification requirements to prime contractors, subcontractors, or others (e.g., bidders) who have or may have an NRC contractual relationship that requires access to classified information or matter, access on a continuing basis (in excess of 90 or more days) to NRC Headquarters controlled buildings, or otherwise requires NRC photo identification or card-key badges.
                (b) It is the contractor's duty to safeguard National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data. The contractor shall, in accordance with the Commission's security regulations and requirements, be responsible for safeguarding National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data, and for protecting against sabotage, espionage, loss, and theft, the classified documents and material in the contractor's possession in connection with the performance of work under this contract. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the contractor shall transmit to the Commission any classified matter in the possession of the contractor or any person under the contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract upon completion or termination of this contract.
                (1) The contractor shall complete a certificate of possession to be furnished to the Commission specifying the classified matter to be retained if the retention is:
                (i) Required after the completion or termination of the contract; and
                (ii) Approved by the contracting officer.
                
                (2) The certification must identify the items and types or categories of matter retained, the conditions governing the retention of the matter and their period of retention, if known. If the retention is approved by the contracting officer, the security provisions of the contract continue to be applicable to the matter retained.
                (c) In connection with the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor may be furnished, or may develop or acquire, proprietary data (trade secrets) or confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information, including Commission plans, policies, reports, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), or other information which has not been released to the public or has been determined by the Commission to be otherwise exempt from disclosure to the public. The contractor agrees to hold the information in confidence and not to directly or indirectly duplicate, disseminate, or disclose the information, in whole or in part, to any other person or organization except as necessary to perform the work under this contract. The contractor agrees to return the information to the Commission or otherwise dispose of it at the direction of the contracting officer. Failure to comply with this clause is grounds for termination of this contract.
                (d) Regulations. The contractor agrees to conform to all security regulations and requirements of the Commission which are subject to change as directed by the NRC Division of Facilities and Security and the Contracting Officer. These changes will be under the authority of the FAR Changes clause referenced in Section I of this document.
                (e) Definition of national security information. As used in this clause, the term national security information means information that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12958 or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is so designated.
                (f) Definition of restricted data. As used in this clause, the term Restricted Data means all data concerning design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; the production of special nuclear material; or the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, but does not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category under to Section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
                (g) Definition of formerly restricted data. As used in this clause the term Formerly Restricted Data means all data removed from the Restricted Data category under Section 142-d of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
                (h) Security clearance personnel. The contractor may not permit any individual to have access to Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, or other classified information, except in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations or requirements applicable to the particular type or category of classified information to which access is required. The contractor shall also execute a Standard Form 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement, when access to classified information is required.
                (i) Criminal liabilities. Disclosure of National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data relating to the work or services ordered hereunder to any person not entitled to receive it, or failure to safeguard any Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, or any other classified matter that may come to the contractor or any person under the contractor's control in connection with work under this contract, may subject the contractor, its agents, employees, or subcontractors to criminal liability under the laws of the United States. (See the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794; and Executive Order 12958.)
                (j) Subcontracts and purchase orders. Except as otherwise authorized, in writing, by the contracting officer, the contractor shall insert provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase orders under this contract.
                (k) In performing contract work, the contractor shall classify all documents, material, and equipment originated or generated by the contractor in accordance with guidance issued by the Commission. Every subcontract and purchase order issued under the contract that involves originating or generating classified documents, material, and equipment must provide that the subcontractor or supplier assign the proper classification to all documents, material, and equipment in accordance with guidance furnished by the contractor.
              
              (End of clause)

              Site access badge requirements.
              As prescribed at 2004.404(b), the contracting officer shall insert the following clause in all solicitations and contracts under which the contractor will require access to Government facilities. The clause may be altered to reflect any special conditions to be applied to foreign nationals:
              
                Site Access Badge Requirements (JAN 1993)

                During the life of this contract, the rights of ingress and egress for contractor personnel must be made available as required. In this regard, all contractor personnel whose duties under this contract require their presence on-site shall be clearly identifiable by a distinctive badge furnished by the Government. The Project Officer shall assist the contractor in obtaining the badges for contractor personnel. It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to ensure that each employee has proper identification at all times. All prescribed identification must be immediately delivered to the Security Office for cancellation or disposition upon the termination of employment of any contractor personnel. Contractor personnel shall have this identification in their possession during on-site performance under this contract. It is the contractor's duty to assure that contractor personnel enter only those work areas necessary for performance of contract work and to assure the safeguarding of any Government records or data that contractor personnel may come into contact with.
              
              (End of clause)
            
            
              2052.209-70
              Current/former agency employee involvement.
              As prescribed at 2009.105-70, the contracting officer shall insert the following provision in all solicitations:
              
                Current/Former Agency Employee Involvement (OCT 1999)
                (a) The following representation is required by the NRC Acquisition Regulation 2009.105-70(b). It is not NRC policy to encourage offerors and contractors to propose current/former agency employees to perform work under NRC contracts and as set forth in the above cited provision, the use of such employees may, under certain conditions, adversely affect NRC's consideration of non-competitive proposals and task orders.
                (b) There ( ) are ( ) are no current/former NRC employees (including special Government employees performing services as experts, advisors, consultants, or members of advisory committees) who have been or will be involved, directly or indirectly, in developing the offer, or in negotiating on behalf of the offeror, or in managing, administering, or performing any contract, consultant agreement, or subcontract resulting from this offer. For each individual so identified, the Technical and Management proposal must contain, as a separate attachment, the name of the individual, the individual's title while employed by the NRC, the date individual left NRC, and a brief description of the individual's role under this proposal.
              
              (End of provision)
            
            
              2052.209-71
              Contractor organizational conflicts of interest (representation).
              As prescribed in 2009.570-4(b) and 2009.570-8, the contracting officer must insert the following provision in applicable solicitations and in contracts resulting from unsolicited proposals. The contracting officer must also include the following in task orders and contract modifications for new work.
              
                Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest Representation (OCT 1999)
                I represent to the best of my knowledge and belief that:
                The award to ________ of a contract or the modification of an existing contract does / / does not / / involve situations or relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b).
                (a) If the representation, as completed, indicates that situations or relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b) are involved, or the contracting officer otherwise determines that potential organizational conflicts of interest exist, the offeror shall provide a statement in writing that describes in a concise manner all relevant factors bearing on his representation to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer determines that organizational conflicts exist, the following actions may be taken:
                (1) Impose appropriate conditions which avoid such conflicts;
                (2) Disqualify the offeror; or
                (3) Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to seek award of the contract under the waiver provisions of 48 CFR 2009-570-9.
                (b) The refusal to provide the representation required by 48 CFR 2009.570-4(b), or upon request of the contracting officer, the facts required by 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b), must result in disqualification of the offeror for award.
              
              (End of provision)
            
            
              2052.209-72
              Contractor organizational conflicts of interest.
              As prescribed at 2009.570-5(a) and 2009.570-8, the contracting officer must insert the following clause in all applicable solicitations, contracts, and simplified acquisitions of the types described; 2009.570-4(b):
              
                Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest (JAN 1993)
                (a) Purpose. The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that the contractor:
                
                (1) Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to the work under this contract; and
                (2) Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.
                (b) Scope. The restrictions described apply to performance or participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the activities covered by this clause.
                (c) Work for others. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to forego entering into consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract. The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by the provision of this clause. If the contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such contractual arrangement.
                (2) The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the services within the scope of this contract (or task order as appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.
                (3) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task order contract).
                (4) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,
                (i) The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate.
                (ii) The contractor may not perform work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.
                (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical bias or unfair competitive advantage.
                (d) Disclosure after award. (1) The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2.
                (2) The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This statement must include a description of the action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts. The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if termination is in the best interest of the Government.
                (3) It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities. Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the underlying contract. Further, if this contract involves work at a licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant site. This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer. The disclosure must include the statement of work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated utility or other regulated entity. NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section.
                (e) Access to and use of information. (1) If, in the performance of this contract, the contractor obtains access to information, such as NRC plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), the contractor agrees not to:
                (i) Use this information for any private purpose until the information has been released to the public;
                (ii) Compete for work for the Commission based on the information for a period of six months after either the completion of this contract or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;
                (iii) Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government based on the information until one year after the release of the information to the public; or
                (iv) Release the information without prior written approval by the contracting officer unless the information has previously been released to the public by the NRC.
                (2) In addition, the contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, the contractor shall treat the information in accordance with restrictions placed on use of the information.
                (3) Subject to patent and security provisions of this contract, the contractor shall have the right to use technical data it produces under this contract for private purposes provided that all requirements of this contract have been met.
                (f) Subcontracts. Except as provided in 48 CFR 2009.570-2, the contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in subcontracts of any tier. The terms contract, contractor, and contracting officer, must be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
                (g) Remedies. For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant interest required to be disclosed concerning this contract or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify the contractor from subsequent contractual efforts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or this contract.
                (h) Waiver. A request for waiver under this clause must be directed in writing to the contracting officer in accordance with the procedures outlined in 48 CFR 2009.570-9.
                (i) Follow-on effort. The contractor shall be ineligible to participate in NRC contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefor (solicited or unsolicited) which stem directly from the contractor's performance of work under this contract. Furthermore, unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, the contractor may not perform any technical consulting or management support services work or evaluation activities under this contract on any of its products or services or the products or services of another firm if the contractor has been substantially involved in the development or marketing of the products or services.
                (1) If the contractor under this contract, prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications, the contractor is not eligible to perform or participate in the initial contractual effort which is based on the statement of work or specifications. The contractor may not incorporate its products or services in the statement of work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, in which case the restrictions in this paragraph do not apply.
                (2) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the contractor from offering or selling its standard commercial items to the Government.

              Bid evaluation.
              As prescribed at 2014.201-670(c), the contracting officer shall insert the following provision in applicable invitations for bids (paragraph “(f)” of this provision is optional):
              
                Bid Evaluation (JAN 1993)
                (a) Award will be made to that responsive, responsible bidder within the meaning of FAR Subpart 9.1 whose total bid amount, as set forth by the bidder in Section B of this Invitation for Bid (IFB), constitutes the lowest overall evaluated final contract price to the Government based upon the requirements for the schedule. Bids will be evaluated for purposes of award by first ascertaining the sum of the total amount for each of the items specified in Section B of this solicitation. This will constitute the bidder's “Total Bid Amount.”
                (b) Bidders shall insert a definite price or indicate “no charge” in the blank space provided for each item and/or sub-item listed in Section B. Unless expressly provided for in the bid, no additional charge will be allowed for work performed under the contract other than the unit prices stipulated for each item and/or sub-item.

                (c) Any bid which is materially unbalanced as to price for the separate items specified in Section B of this IFB may be rejected as nonresponsive. An unbalanced bid is defined as one which is based on prices which, in the opinion of the NRC, are significantly less than cost for some work and/or prices that may be significantly overstated for other work.
                
                (d) Separation charges, in any form, are not solicited. Bids containing charges for discontinuance, termination, failure to exercise an option, or for any other purpose will cause the bid to be rejected as nonresponsive.
                (e) A preaward on-site survey of the bidder's facilities, equipment, etc., in accordance with FAR 9.105 and 9.106, may be made by representatives of the Commission for the purpose of determining whether the bidder is responsible within the meaning of FAR 9.1, and whether the bidder possesses qualifications that are conducive to the production of work that will meet the requirements, specifications, and provisions of this contract. If requested by the Commission, the prospective contractor may also be required to submit statements within * hours after receiving the request:
                (1) Concerning their ability to meet any of the minimum standards set forth in FAR 9.104,
                (2) Samples of work, and
                (3) Names and addresses of additional clients, Government agencies, and/or commercial firms which the bidder is now doing or had done business with.
                (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the award of any contract resulting from this solicitation will be made on an “all or none” basis. Thus, bids submitted on fewer than the items listed in Section B of this IFB, or on fewer than the estimated quantity, will cause the bid to be rejected as nonresponsive.
                *To be inserted into solicitation.

                *
                
                The contractor agrees that personnel may not be removed from the contract work or replaced without compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
                (b) If one or more of the key personnel, for whatever reason, becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this contract for a continuous period exceeding 30 work days, or is expected to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in the proposal or initially anticipated, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer and shall, subject to the con currence of the contracting officer, promptly replace the personnel with personnel of at least substantially equal ability and qualifications.

                (c) Each request for approval of substitutions must be in writing and contain a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions. The request must also contain a complete resume for the proposed substitute and other information requested or needed by the contracting officer to evaluate the proposed substitution. The contracting officer and the project officer shall evaluate the contractor's request and the contracting officer shall promptly notify the contractor of his or her decision in writing.

                (d) If the contracting officer determines that suitable and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated, or have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not reasonably forthcoming, or that the resultant reduction of productive effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of the contract or the service order, the contract may be terminated by the contracting officer for default or for the convenience of the Government, as appropriate. If the contracting officer finds the contractor at fault for the condition, the contract price or fixed fee may be equitably adjusted downward to compensate the Government for any resultant delay, loss, or damage.
                
                *To be incorporated into any resultant contract

              As prescribed at 2015.209-70 (a)(4), the contracting officer shall insert the following clause in applicable solicitations:
              
                Award Notification and Commitment of Public Funds (OCT 1999)

                (a) All offerors will be notified of their exclusion from the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.503(a)(1). Under the requirements of FAR 15.503(a)(2), preliminary notification will be provided before award for small business set-aside procurements on negotiated procurements. The contracting officer shall provide written postaward notice to each unsuccessful offeror in accordance with FAR 15.503(b).
                
                (b) The contracting officer is the only individual who can legally commit the NRC to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this procurement. This means that, unless provided in a contract document or specifically authorized by the contracting officer, NRC technical personnel may not issue contract modifications, give informal contractual commitments, or otherwise bind, commit, or obligate the NRC contractually. Informal contractual commitments include:
                (1) Encouraging a potential contractor to incur costs before receiving a contract;
                (2) Requesting or requiring a contractor to make changes under a contract without formal contract modifications;
                (3) Encouraging a contractor to incur costs under a cost-reimbursable contract in excess of those costs contractually allowable; and
                (4) Committing the Government to a course of action with regard to a potential contract, contract change, claim, or dispute.

                After award of the contract, one copy of each unsuccessful proposal is retained by the NRC's Division of Contracts and Property Management in accordance with the General Records Schedule 3(5)(b). Unless return of the additional copies of the proposals is requested by the offeror upon submission of the proposals, all other copies will be destroyed. This request should appear in a cover letter accompanying the proposal.

              Proposal presentation and format.
              As prescribed at 2015.209-70(b)(1), the contracting officer may insert the following provision in applicable negotiated procurements for cost type solicitations.

                Proposal Presentation and Format (OCT 1999)
                (a) Information submitted in response to this solicitation must be typed, printed, or reproduced on letter-size paper and each copy must be legible. All information provided, including all resumes, must be accurate, truthful, and complete to the best of the offeror's knowledge and belief. The Commission will rely upon all representations made by the offeror both in the evaluation process and for the performance of the work by the offeror selected for award. The Commission may require the offeror to substantiate the credentials, education, and employment history of its employees, subcontractor personnel, and consultants, through submission of copies of transcripts, diplomas, licenses, etc.
                (b) The offeror shall submit the following material which constitutes its offer, as defined by FAR 2.101, in two separate and distinct parts at the date and time specified in * of the solicitation for receipt of sealed offers.

                (i) The cost proposal shall be submitted separately from the Technical and Management Proposal or Oral Presentation and Supporting Documentation (as applicable).
                (ii) The offeror's request for an exception to submitting cost or pricing data shall be made in accordance with FAR 52.215-20(a).
                (iii) If the contracting officer does not grant the offeror an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data, the offeror's cost proposal shall conform with the requirements of FAR 52.215-20(b). Cost information shall include pertinent details sufficient to show the elements of cost upon which the total cost is predicted in accordance with the requirement of FAR 52.215-20 (b)(1).
                (iv) When the offeror's estimated cost for the proposed work exceeds $100,000 and the duration of the contract period exceeds six months, the offeror shall submit a Contractor Spending Plan (CSP) as part of its cost proposal. Guidance for completing the CSP is attached.
                (v) For any subcontract discussed under the Technical and Management Proposal, or Oral Presentation Material, provide supporting documentation on the selection process, i.e., competitive vs. noncompetitive, and the cost evaluation.
                (c) “Written Technical and Management Proposal” or “Oral Presentation and Supporting Documentation” (as applicable). One (1) original and * copies.

                (1) The written Technical and Management Proposal or Oral Presentation and Supporting Documentation may not contain any reference to cost. Resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, travel, computer time, etc., must be included so that the offeror's understanding of the scope of work may be evaluated.
                
                (2) The offeror shall submit in the written Technical and Management Proposal or Oral Presentation and Supporting Documentation full and complete information as set forth below to permit the Government to make a thorough evaluation and a sound determination that the proposed approach will have a reasonable likelihood of meeting the requirements and objectives of this procurement.
                (3) The written Technical Proposal or Oral Presentation and Supporting Documentation must be tailored to assure that all information reflects a one-to-one relationship to the evaluation criteria.
                (4) Statements which paraphrase the statement of work without communicating the specific approach proposed by the offeror, or statements to the effect that the offeror's understanding can or will comply with the statement of work may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of understanding of the statement of work and objectives.

                Alternate 1 (OCT 1999). As prescribed at 2015.209-70(b)(2), this Alternate 1 may be used for solicitations for negotiated task orders. Include the following paragraph (iv) in place of paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of the basic provision:
              
              
                (b)(2)(iv) The offeror's cost proposal shall be based on the NRC's estimated level of effort. The NRC's estimated level of effort for this procurement is approximately * professional and * clerical staff-years for the duration of this contract. This information is advisory and is not to be considered as the sole basis for the development of the staffing plan. For the purposes of the Government estimate, 2000 hours constitute a staff year. The total estimated cost proposed by the offeror is used for evaluation purposes only. Any resultant contract, except a requirements contract, contains an overall cost ceiling whereby individual task orders may be issued. The cost and fee, if any, for each task order is individually negotiated and also contains a cost ceiling.

                (c) The contractor will be reimbursed only for travel costs incurred that are directly related to this contract and are allowable subject to the limitations prescribed in FAR 31.205-46.
                (d) It is the responsibility of the contractor to notify the contracting officer in accordance with the Limitations of Cost clause of this contract when, at any time, the contractor learns that travel expenses will cause the contractor to exceed the estimated costs specified in the Schedule.

              2052.215-79
              Contract award and evaluation of proposals.
              As prescribed in 2015.209(a)(1), the contracting officer shall insert the following provision in solicitations when technical merit is more important than cost:
              
                Contract Award and Evaluation of Proposals (OCT 1999)
                (a) By use of narrative and numerical (as appropriate) scoring techniques, proposals are evaluated against the evaluation factors specified in paragraph * below. These factors are listed in their relative order of importance.

                (b) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value, as defined in FAR 2.101, after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
                (c) The Government may:
                (1) Reject any or all proposals if the action is in the Government's interest.
                (2) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
                (d) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. The Government reserves the right to seek proposal clarifications (e.g., capability issues as described in FAR 15.306(a) or minor or clerical errors as described in FAR 14.407); and hold communications as described in FAR 15.306(b)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
                (e) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
                (f) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.
                (g) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
                (h) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
                (i) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
                (j) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
                (k) A separate cost analysis is performed on each cost proposal. To provide a common base for evaluation of cost proposals, the level of effort data must be expressed in staff hours. Where a Contractor Spending Plan (CSP) is required by other provisions of this solicitation, consideration is given to the Plan for completeness, reasonableness, and as a measure of effective management of the effort.

                Alternate 1 (OCT 1999). As prescribed at 2015.209-70(e)(2), Alternate 1 may be used when proposals are to be evaluated on a lowest price, technically acceptable basis. Substitute the following paragraph for paragraph (b) in the clause at 2052.215-79:
              
              
                (b) Although technical merit in the evaluation criteria set forth below is a factor in the evaluation of proposals, award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors,
              
              
              
                Alternate 2 (OCT 1999). As prescribed at 2015.209-70(e)(2), Alternate 2 may be used when cost and technical merit are of equal significance. Substitute the following paragraph for paragraph (b) in the clause at 2052.215-79:
              
              
                (b) In the selection of a contractor, technical merit in the evaluation criteria set forth below and cost bear equal significance. To be selected for an award, the proposed cost must be realistic and reasonable.

                Indirect Cost Rates (JAN 1993)
                (a) Pending the establishment of final indirect rates which must be negotiated based on audit of actual costs, the contractor shall be reimbursed for allowable indirect costs as follows:

                (1) Scope of work/meetings/travel and deliverables;
                (2) Reporting requirements;
                (3) Period of performance—place of performance;
                (4) Applicable special provisions;

                (c) Cost proposal. The contractor's cost proposal for each task order must be fully supported by cost and pricing data adequate to establish the reasonableness of the proposed amounts. When the contractor's estimated cost for the proposed task order exceeds $100,000 and the period of performance exceeds six months, the contractor may be required to submit a Contractor Spending Plan (CSP) as part of its cost proposal. The TORP indicates if a CSP is required.
                (d) Task order award. The contractor shall perform all work described in definitized task orders issued by the contracting officer. Definitized task orders include the following:
                (1) Statement of work/meetings/travel and deliverables;

              Accelerated task order procedures.
              As prescribed at 2016.506-70(b), the contracting officer may insert the following clause in applicable solicitations and contracts that contain task order procedures. This clause may be altered to fit the circumstances of the requirement.
              
                Accelerated Task Order Procedures (JAN 1993)
                (a) The NRC may require the contractor to begin work before receiving a definitized task order from the contracting officer. Accordingly, when the contracting officer verbally authorizes the work, the contractor shall proceed with performance of the task order subject to the monetary limitation established for the task order by the contracting officer.
                (b) When this accelerated procedure is employed by the NRC, the contractor agrees to begin promptly negotiating with the contracting officer the terms of the definitive task order and agrees to submit a cost proposal with supporting cost or pricing data. If agreement on a definitized task order is not reached by the target date mutually agreed upon by the contractor and contracting officer, the contracting officer may determine a reasonable price and/or fee in accordance with subpart 15.8 and part 31 of the FAR, subject to contractor appeal as provided in 52.233-1, Disputes. In any event, the contractor shall proceed with completion of the task order subject only to the monetary limitation established by the contracting officer and the terms and conditions of the basic contract.

              As prescribed at 2022.901-70, the contracting officer shall insert the following clause in all solicitations:
              
                Nondiscrimination Because of Age (JAN 1993)
                It is the policy of the Executive Branch of the Government that:
                (a) Contractors and subcontractors engaged in the performance of Federal contracts may not, in connection with the employment, advancement, or discharge of employees or in connection with the terms, conditions, or privileges of their employment, discriminate against persons because of their age except upon the basis of a bona fide occupational qualification, retirement plan, or statutory requirement; and
                (b) That contractors and subcontractors, or persons acting on their behalf, may not specify, in solicitations or advertisements for employees to work on Government contracts, a maximum age limit for employment unless the specified maximum age limit is based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, retirement plan, or statutory requirement.
              
              (End of provision)

              As prescribed at 2027.305-70, the contracting officer shall insert the following clause in all solicitations and contracts in which drawings, designs, specifications, and other data will be developed and the NRC must retain full rights to them (except for the contractor's right to retain a copy for its own use). When any of the clauses prescribed at FAR 27.409 are included in the solicitation and contract, this clause will not be used.
              
                Drawings, Designs, Specifications, and Other Data (JAN 1993)
                All drawings, sketches, designs, design data, specifications, notebooks, technical and scientific data, and all photographs, negatives, reports, findings, recommendations, other data and memoranda of every description relating thereto, as well as all copies of the foregoing relating to the work or any part thereto, are subject to inspection by the Commission at all reasonable times. Inspection of the proper facilities must be afforded the Commission by the contractor and its subcontractors. These data are the property of the Government and may be used by the Government for any purpose whatsoever without any claim on the part of the contractor and its subcontractors and vendors for additional compensation and must, subject to the right of the contractor to retain a copy of the material for its own use, be delivered to the Government, or otherwise disposed of by the contractor as the contracting officer may direct during the progress of the work or upon completion or termination of this contract. The contractor's right of retention and use is subject to the security, patent, and use of information provisions, if any, of this contract.

                Precontract Costs (JAN 1993)
                Allowable costs under this contract include costs incurred by the contractor in connection with the work covered by this contract during the period from * and including * to the effective date of this contract that would have been allowable under the terms of this contract if this contract had been in effect during that period. However, the costs may not in aggregate exceed * which is included in the estimated cost of this contract.
                *To be incorporated into any resultant contract.

However, such publication and papers shall focus on advances in science and technology and minimize conclusions and/or recommendations which may have regulatory implications.
                (c) The principal investigator(s) shall coordinate all such publications with, and transmit a copy of the proposed article or paper to, the NRC Contracting Officer or Project Officer, prior to publication. The NRC agrees to review and provide comments within thirty (30) days after receipt of a proposed publication. However, in those cases where the information to be published is (1) subject to Commission approval, (2) has not been ruled upon, or (3) disapproved by the Commission, the NRC reserves the right to disapprove or delay the publication. Further, if the NRC disagrees with the proposed publication for any reason, it reserves the right to require that any publication not identify the NRC's sponsorship of the work and that any associated publication costs shall be borne by the contractor.

                The contractor shall take all reasonable precautions in the performance of the work under this contract to protect the health and safety of its employees and of members of the public, including NRC employees and contractor personnel, and to minimize danger from all hazards to life and property. The contractor shall comply with all applicable health, safety, and fire protection regulations and requirements (including reporting requirements) of the Commission and the Department of Labor. If the contractor fails to comply with these regulations or requirements, the contracting officer may, without prejudice to any other legal or contractual rights of the Commission, issue an order stopping all or any part of the work. Thereafter, a start work order for resumption of work may be issued at the discretion of the contracting officer. The contractor may not make a claim for an extension of time or for compensation or damages by reason of, or in connection with, this type of work stoppage.

              Resolving differing professional views.
              As prescribed in 2042.570-1, the contracting officer shall insert the following clause in the body of cost reimbursement solicitations and contracts for professional services, as appropriate. This clause may not be altered by the contracting officer.
              
                Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views (DPVs) (Date)
                (a) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) policy is to support the contractor's expression of professional health and safety related concerns associated with the contractor's work for NRC that may differ from a prevailing NRC staff view, disagree with an NRC decision or policy position, or take issue with proposed or established agency practices. An occasion may arise when an NRC contractor, contractor's personnel, or subcontractor personnel believes that a conscientious expression of a competent judgement is required to document such concerns on matters directly associated with its performance of the contract. The NRC's policy is to support these instances as Differing Professional Views (DPVs).
                (b) The procedure that will be used provides for the expression and resolution of differing professional views (DPVs) of health and safety related concerns associated with the mission of the agency by NRC contractors, contractor personnel or subcontractor personnel on matters directly associated with its performance of the contract. This procedure may be found in Attachments to this document. The contractor shall provide a copy of the NRC DPV procedure to all of its employees performing under this contract and to all subcontractors who shall, in turn, provide a copy of the procedure to its employees. The prime contractor or subcontractor shall submit all DPV's received but need not endorse them.
              
              (End of clause)
            
            
              2052.242-71
              Procedures for Resolving Differing Professional Views.
              As prescribed in 2042.570-2(b), the contracting officer shall include the following clause as an attachment to cost reimbursement solicitations and contracts for professional services, as appropriate. This clause may not be altered by the contracting officer.
              
                Procedures for Resolving NRC Contractor Differing Professional Views (DPVs) (OCT 1999)
                (a) The following procedure provides for the expression and resolution of differing professional views (DPVs) of health and safety related concerns of NRC contractors and contractor personnel on matters connected to the subject of the contract. Subcontractor DPVs must be submitted through the prime contractor. The prime contractor or subcontractor shall submit all DPV's received but need not endorse them.
                (b) The NRC may authorize up to eight reimbursable hours for the contractor to document, in writing, a DPV by the contractor, the contractor's personnel, or subcontractor personnel. The contractor shall not be entitled to any compensation for effort on a DPV which exceeds the specified eight hour limit.
                (c) Before incurring costs to document a DPV, the contractor shall first determine whether there are sufficient funds obligated under the contract which are available to cover the costs of writing a DPV. If there are insufficient obligated funds under the contract, the contractor shall first request the NRC contracting officer for additional funding to cover the costs of preparing the DPV and authorization to proceed.
                (d) Contract funds shall not be authorized to document an allegation where the use of this NRC contractor DPV process is inappropriate. Examples of such instances are: allegations of wrongdoing which should be addressed directly to the NRC Office of the Inspector General (OIG), issues submitted anonymously, or issues raised which have already been considered, addressed, or rejected, absent significant new information. This procedure does not provide anonymity. Individuals desiring anonymity should contact the NRC OIG or submit the information under NRC's Allegation Program, as appropriate.
                (e) When required, the contractor shall initiate the DPV process by submitting a written statement directly to the NRC Office Director or Regional Administrator responsible for the contract, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, Division of Contracts and Property Management, Office of Administration. Each DPV submitted will be evaluated on its own merits.
                (f) The DPV, while being brief, must contain the following as it relates to the subject matter of the contract:
                (1) A summary of the prevailing NRC view, existing NRC decision or stated position, or the proposed or established NRC practice.

                (2) A description of the submitter's views and how they differ from any of the above items.
                
                (3) The rationale for the submitter's views, including an assessment based on risk, safety and cost benefit considerations of the consequences should the submitter's position not be adopted by NRC.
                (g) The Office Director or Regional Administrator will immediately forward the submittal to the NRC DPV Review Panel and acknowledge receipt of the DPV, ordinarily within five (5) calendar days of receipt.
                (h) The panel will normally review the DPV within seven calendar days of receipt to determine whether enough information has been supplied to undertake a detailed review of the issue. Typically, within 30 calendar days of receipt of the necessary information to begin a review, the panel will provide a written report of its findings to the Office Director or Regional Administrator and to the Contracting Officer, which includes a recommended course of action.
                (i) The Office Director or Regional Administrator will consider the DPV Review Panel's report, make a decision on the DPV and provide a written decision to the contractor and the Contracting Officer normally within seven calendar days after receipt of the panel's recommendation.
                (j) Subsequent to the decision made regarding the DPV Review Panel's report, a summary of the issue and its disposition will be included in the NRC Weekly Information Report submitted by the Office Director. The DPV file will be retained in the Office or Region for a minimum of one year thereafter. For purposes of the contract, the DPV shall be considered a deliverable under the contract. Based upon the Office Director or Regional Administrator's report, the matter will be closed.

              (a) The LIFAR is issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with the authority of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 87 and other applicable laws and regulations.
              (b) The LIFAR does not replace or incorporate regulations found at 5 CFR part 870, which provide the substantive policy guidance for administration of the FEGLI Program under 5 U.S.C. chapter 87. The following is the order of precedence in interpreting a contract provision under the FEGLI Program:
              (1) 5 U.S.C. chapter 87.
              (2) 5 CFR part 870.
              (3) 48 CFR chapters 1 and 21.
              (4) The FEGLI Program contract.

              2101.103
              Applicability.
              The FAR is generally applicable to contracts negotiated in the FEGLI Program pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 87. The LIFAR implements and supplements the FAR where necessary to identify basic and significant acquisition policies unique to the FEGLI Program.

              Publication and code arrangement.
              (a) The LIFAR and its subsequent changes are published in:
              (1) Daily issues of the Federal Register; and
              (2) The Code of Federal Regulations, in cumulative form.
              (b) The LIFAR is issued as chapter 21 of title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
            
            
              2101.104-2
              Arrangement of regulations.
              (a) General. The LIFAR conforms with the arrangement and numbering system prescribed by FAR 1.104 and 1.303. However, when a FAR part or subpart is adequate for use without further OPM implementation or supplementation, there will be no corresponding LIFAR part, subpart, etc. The LIFAR is to be used in conjunction with the FAR and the order for use is:
              (1) FAR;
              (2) LIFAR.
              (b) Citation. (1) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, citation of Chapter 21 material that has been published in the Federal Register will be to title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
              (2) In informal documents, any section of chapter 21 may be identified as “LIFAR” followed by the section number.

              Policy.

              (a) Procedures, contract clauses, and other aspects of the acquisition process for contracts in the FEGLI Program shall be consistent with the principles of the FAR. Changes to the FAR that are otherwise authorized by statute or applicable regulation, dictated by the practical realities associated with certain unique aspects of life insurance, or necessary to satisfy specific needs of the Office of Personnel Management, to the extent not otherwise regulated in the FAR, shall be implemented as amendments to the LIFAR and published in the Federal Register, or as deviations to the FAR in accordance with FAR subpart 1.4.
              (b) OPM may issue internal procedures, instructions, directives, and guides to clarify or implement the LIFAR within OPM. Clarifying or implementing procedures, instructions, directives, and guides issued pursuant to this section of the LIFAR must:
              (1) Be consistent with the policies and procedures contained in this chapter as implemented and supplemented from time to time; and
              (2) Follow the format, arrangement, and numbering system of this chapter to the extent practicable.

              (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, if the LIFAR is amended in a manner which would increase the contractor's(s') costs or liabilities under the contract(s), the amendment will be made effective the October 1 subsequent to the amendment's promulgation, unless the contractor(s) agree(s) in writing to an earlier date.
              (c) Except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, if the LIFAR is amended between July 31 and October 1 in a manner which would increase the contractor's(s') costs or liabilities under the contract(s), the amendment will not be effective until the October 1 in the year following the amendment's promulgation, unless the contractor(s) agree(s) in writing to an earlier date.
              (d) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are not applicable to amendments that are necessary to implement new or existing legislation.
              (e) OPM will not initiate any changes to the LIFAR during a continuity of services period, as discussed in section 2152.237-70 of this chapter.

              (a) OPM, or the Contractor with the approval of OPM, makes available to Federal employees a booklet describing the provisions of the FEGLI Program, which includes information about eligibility, enrollment, and general procedures. The booklet, along with valid election documents, serves as certification of the employee's coverage under the FEGLI Program. Any marketing/advertising directed specifically at Federal employees and life insurance contacts with Federal employees for the purpose of selling FEGLI Program coverage must be approved by OPM in advance.

              (b) The Contractor is prohibited from making incomplete and/or incorrect comparisons or using disparaging or minimizing techniques to compare its other products or services to those of the FEGLI Program. The Contractor agrees that any advertising material authorized and released by the Contractor which mentions the FEGLI Program will be truthful and not misleading and will present an accurate statement of FEGLI Program benefits. The Contractor will use reasonable efforts to assure that agents selling its other products are aware of and abide by this prohibition.
              (c) The contractor's failure to conform to the requirements of this subpart shall be considered by OPM in the determination of the service charge prenegotiation objective.

              Applicability.
              FAR part 5 has no practical application to the FEGLI Program because the requirements for eligible contractors (i.e., qualified life insurance companies) are stated in 5 U.S.C. 8709.

              Certification regarding debarment, suspension, proposed debarment and other responsibility matters.
              FAR subpart 9.4 is implemented by changing the FAR offeror's certification at FAR 52.209-5 (which is part of a solicitation) to a pre-contract certificate and a contract clause. These provisions reflect the FEGLI Program's statutory exemption from competitive bidding (5 U.S.C. 8709), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.

              2109.7001
              Minimum standards for FEGLI Program contractors.
              (a) The Contractor must meet the requirements of chapter 87 of title 5, United States Code; part 870 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations; chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations; and the standards in this subpart. The Contractor must continue to meet these and the following statutory and regulatory requirements while under contract with OPM. Failure to meet these requirements and standards is cause for OPM's termination of the contract in accordance with part 2149 of this chapter.

              (b) The contractor must actually be engaged in the life insurance business and must be licensed to transact life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance under the laws of all the States and the District of Columbia at the time of application.
              
              (c) The contractor must not be a Federal, State, local or territorial government entity.
              (d) The contractor must not be debarred, suspended or ineligible to participate in Government contracting or subcontracting for any reason.
              (e) The contractor must keep statistical and financial records regarding the FEGLI Program separate from that of all its other lines of business.
              (f) The Contractor agrees to enter into annual premium rate redeterminations with OPM.
              (g) The Contractor must furnish such reasonable reports as OPM determines are necessary to administer the FEGLI Program. The cost of preparation of such reports will be considered an allowable expense within the administrative expense ceiling defined in section 2152.231-70 of this chapter.
              (h) The contractor must establish and maintain a system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance that:
              (1) The payment of claims and other expenses is in compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual guidelines;
              (2) Funds, property, and other FEGLI Program assets are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation;

              (4) Data are accurately and fairly disclosed in all reports required by OPM.
              (i) The contractor must permit representatives of OPM and of the General Accounting Office to audit and examine records and accounts pertaining to the FEGLI Program at such reasonable times and places as may be designated by OPM or the General Accounting Office.

              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart prescribes mandatory specifications for performance under FEGLI Program contracts.

                Investment income, as used in this subpart, means the net amount on an investment of FEGLI Program funds earned by the contractor after deducting reasonable, necessary, and properly allocated investment expenses.
              
                Significant event, as used in this subpart, means any occurrence or anticipated occurrence that might reasonably be expected to have a material effect upon the contractor's ability to meet its obligations under the LIFAR.
            
            
              2110.7002
              Contractor investment of FEGLI Program funds.
              (a) The Contractor is required to invest and reinvest all FEGLI Program funds on hand, including any attributable to the special contingency reserve (as used in 5 U.S.C. 8712), until needed to discharge promptly the obligations incurred under the contract. Within the constraints of safety and liquidity of investments, the Contractor must seek to maximize investment income. However, the Contractor will not be responsible for any actions taken at the direction of OPM.

              (b) The Contractor is required to credit income earned from its investment of FEGLI Program funds to the FEGLI Program. Thus, the Contractor must be able to allocate investment income to the FEGLI Program in an appropriate manner. If the Contractor fails to invest funds on hand, properly allocate investment income, or credit any income due to the contract, for whatever reason, it must return or credit any investment income lost to OPM or the FEGLI Program, retroactive to the date that such funds should have been originally invested, allocated, or credited in accordance with the clause at 2152.210-70 of this chapter.

              (b) OPM will announce any opportunities to submit applications to provide life insurance through the FEGLI Program in insurance industry periodicals and other publications as deemed appropriate by OPM. The announcement will contain information on the address to which requests for application packages should be submitted and on deadline dates for submission of completed applications.

              (c) Eligible contractors (i.e., qualified life insurance companies) are identified in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8709. Prospective contractors voluntarily come forth in accordance with procedures provided in section 2115.370.
              (d) OPM may approve one or more life insurance companies that, in its judgment, are best qualified to provide life insurance coverage to Federal enrollees.

              (a) Applications must be signed by an individual with legal authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the company for the dollar level of claims and expenses anticipated.
              (b) Applications will be reviewed for evidence of substantial compliance in the following areas:
              (1) Management: Stable management with experience pertinent to the life insurance industry and, in particular, large group management; sufficient operating experience to enable OPM to evaluate past and expected future performance.
              (2) Marketing: Past ability to attract and retain large group contracts; steady or increasing amount of group life insurance in force.
              (3) Legal expertise: Demonstrated competence in researching, compiling, and implementing various Federal and State laws that may impact payment of benefits; ability to defend legal challenges to payment of benefits.
              (4) Financial condition: Establishment of firm budget projections and demonstrated success in keeping costs at or below those projections on a regular basis; evidence of the ability to sustain operations in the future and to meet obligations under the contract OPM might enter into with the company; adequate reserve levels; assets exceeding liabilities.
              (5) Establishment of office: Ability to establish an administrative office capable of assessing, tracking, and paying claims.
              (6) Internal controls: Ability to establish and maintain a system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance that the payment of claims and other expenses will be in compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual guidelines; funds, property, and other FEGLI Program assets will be safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and revenues and expenditures applicable to FEGLI Program operations will be properly recorded and accounted for to permit the preparation of timely and accurate financial reporting and to maintain accountability over assets.

              Policy.
              Pricing of FEGLI Program premium rates is governed by 5 U.S.C. 8707, 8708, 8711, 8714a, 8714b, and 8714c. FAR subpart 15.4 will be implemented by applying cost analysis policies and procedures. To the extent that reasonable or good faith actuarial estimates are used for pricing, such estimates will be deemed acceptable and, if inaccurate, will not constitute defective pricing.

              2115.404-70
              Profit.
              (a) Risk charge. (1) Section 8711(d) of title 5, United States Code, provides for payment of a risk charge to FEGLI Program contractors as compensation for the risk assumed under the FEGLI Program. It is appropriate to pay such a charge when substantial risk is borne by the contractor; that is, when the balance in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund is no larger than five times annual claims.
              (2) The risk charge is determined by agreement between the contractor and OPM. The amount of risk charge shall be specified in the contract.
              (b) Waiver of the risk charge. (1) When the Fund balance is greater than five times annual claims, OPM and the contractor may agree that the contractor will relinquish the risk charge in favor of a profit opportunity in the form of a service charge for the contractor. The service charge so determined shall be the total service charge that may be negotiated for the contract and shall encompass any service charge (whether entitled service charge, profit, fee, contribution to surpluses, etc.) that may have been negotiated by the prime contractor with any subcontractor. At no time may both a risk charge and a service charge be paid for the same portion of a policy year.
              (2) Once agreement to relinquish the risk charge is made, the agreement may not be cancelled unless OPM and the Contractor mutually agree to reinstitute payment of a risk charge; or unless the Fund balance falls below the level defined in 2115.404-70(a) and 30 days' notice of cancellation is provided; or unless the Contractor or OPM provides notice of cancellation for any reason 1 year prior to the date cancellation is sought.
              (c) Any profit prenegotiation objective (service charge) will be determined on the basis of a weighted guidelines structured approach.

              2115.404-71
              Profit analysis factors.
              (a) The OPM Contracting Officer will apply a weighted guidelines method when developing the prenegotiation objective (service charge) for the FEGLI Program contract. In accordance with the factors defined in FAR 15.404-4(d), OPM will apply the appropriate weights derived from the ranges specified in paragraph (b) of this section and will determine the prenegotiation objective based on the total dollar amount of the Contractor's Basic and Option C (family optional insurance) claims paid in the previous contract year.
              (1) Contractor performance. OPM will consider such elements as the accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and validity of complaints received by OPM, effectiveness of internal controls systems in place, the timeliness and adequacy of reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, enrollees, beneficiaries, and Congress as measures of economical and efficient contract performance. This factor will be judged apart from the Contractor's basic responsibility for contract compliance and will be a measure of the extent and nature of the Contractor's contribution to the FEGLI Program through the application of managerial expertise and effort. Evidence of effective contract performance will receive a plus weight, and poor performance or failure to comply with contract terms and conditions a zero weight. Innovations of benefit to the FEGLI Program will generally receive a plus weight; documented inattention or indifference to effective operations, a zero weight.
              (2) Contract cost risk. OPM will evaluate the Contractor's risk annually in relation to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund and will evaluate this factor accordingly.
              (3) Federal socioeconomic programs. OPM will consider documented evidence of successful Contractor-initiated efforts to support such Federal socioeconomic programs as drug and substance abuse deterrents and other concerns of the type enumerated in FAR 15.404-4(d)(1)(iii) as a factor in negotiating profit. This factor will be related to the quality of the Contractor's policies and procedures and the extent of exceptional effort or achievement demonstrated. Evidence of effective support of Federal socioeconomic programs will result in a plus weight; indifference to Federal socioeconomic programs will result in a zero weight; and only deliberate failure to provide opportunities to persons and organizations that would benefit from these programs will result in a negative weight.
              (4) Capital investments. This factor is generally not applicable to FEGLI Program contracts because facilities capital cost of money may be an allowable administrative expense. Generally, this factor will be given a weight of zero. However, special purpose facilities or investment costs of direct benefit to the FEGLI Program that are not recoverable as allowable or allocable administrative expenses may be taken into account in assigning a plus weight.
              (5) Cost control. This factor is based on the Contractor's previously demonstrated ability to perform effectively and economically. In addition, consideration will be given to measures taken by the Contractor that result in productivity improvements and other cost containment accomplishments that will be of future benefit to the FEGLI Program. Examples are containment of costs associated with processing claims; success at preventing waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation of FEGLI Program assets; and success at limiting and recovering erroneous benefit payments.
              (6) Independent development. Consideration will be given to independent Contractor-initiated efforts, such as the development of a unique and enhanced customer support system, that are of demonstrated value to the FEGLI Program and for which developmental costs have not been recovered directly or indirectly through allowable or allocable administrative expenses. This factor will be used to provide additional profit opportunities based upon an assessment of the Contractor's investment and risk in developing techniques, methods, practices, etc., having viability to the Program at large. Improvements and innovations recognized and rewarded under any other profit factor cannot be considered.
              (7) Transitional services. This factor is based on the Contractor's performance of transitional activities during a continuity of services period as described in the clause at 2152.237-70 of this chapter. These are any activities apart from the normal servicing of the contract during an active contract term. Other than for a transitional period, the weight applied to this factor for any active contract term is zero.
              (b) The weight ranges for each factor to be used in the weighted guidelines approach are set forth in the following table:

              FEGLI Program contracts.

              FEGLI Program contracts are fixed price with limited cost redetermination plus fixed fee. The premium paid to the Contractor is mutually agreed upon by OPM and the Contractor and is based on an estimate of benefits and administrative costs, plus the fixed service or risk charge, and is determined annually. Claims costs, including benefits and administrative expenses, in excess of premiums are paid up to the amount in the Employees' Life Insurance Fund. Payment for costs exceeding the amount in the Fund are the responsibility of the Contractor and reinsurers. The fee is fixed at the inception of each contract year. The fee does not vary with the actual costs but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract. The fee is in the form of either a risk charge or a service charge.
              (a) Risk charge. The risk charge will be determined as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 8711(d) and section 2115.404-70 of this chapter. It will consist of a negotiated amount which will reflect the risk assumed by the Contractor and the reinsurers and may be adjusted as a result of increased or decreased risk under the contract. When the applicable fee is a risk charge, no service charge will be paid for the same period of time.
              (b) Service charge. The amount of the service charge will be determined using a weighted guidelines structured approach in accordance with section 2115.404-71 of this chapter and negotiated with the Contractor at the beginning of the contract term. When the applicable fee is a service charge, no risk charge will be paid for the same period of time.

              The provisions at FAR sections 52.222-21, 52.222-22, 52-222.25 are implemented by changing the word “offeror” to “Contractor” and the word “solicitation” to “contract” wherever they appear in the text to reflect the FEGLI Program's statutory exemption from competitive bidding (5 U.S.C. 8709), which obviates the issuance of solicitations.

              Records retained by FEGLI Program contractors on Federal insureds and members of their families serve the contractors' own commercial function of paying FEGLI Program claims and are not maintained to accomplish an agency function of OPM. Consequently, the records do not fall within the provisions of the Privacy Act. Nevertheless, OPM recognizes the need for the contractors to keep certain records confidential. The clause at 2152.224-70 addresses this concern.

Nothing in this contract shall be construed as implying that the Government will make additional funds available later or that Congress will appropriate funds later sufficient to meet deficiencies.

              (b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not be construed to exempt the contractor from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, fee, or other monetary payment on the net income or profit accruing to or realized by it from business conducted under the FEGLI Program if the tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.

If a reasonable basis to sustain a claimed exemption exists, the seller will be furnished evidence of exemption if requested by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer or at the discretion of the contracting officer.

              (a) Costs of media messages are allowable if approved by the contracting officer and all of the following criteria are met:
              (1) The primary objective of the message is to disseminate information on general health and fitness or encouraging healthful lifestyles;
              (2) The costs of the contractor's messages are allocated to all underwritten and non-underwritten lines of business; and
              (3) The contracting officer approves the total dollar amount of the contractor's messages to be charged to the FEGLI Program in advance of the policy year.
              (b) Costs of media messages that inform enrollees about the FEGLI Program are allowable if approved by the contracting officer.

              (c) In those instances where contracting officer approval of the total dollar amount is not solicited in advance, it is incumbent upon the contractor to show the contracting officer, for subsequent approval, that the costs are reasonable and do not unduly burden the administrative cost to the contract.
              (d) Costs of messages that are intended to, or which have the primary effect of, calling favorable attention to the contractor or subcontractor for the purpose of enhancing its overall image or selling its product or services are not allowable.

The contracting officer shall allow an unrecovered erroneous payment to be charged to the contract provided the contractor demonstrates that the recovery of the erroneous payment was attempted in accordance with a system that is approved under 2146.270(b) and that either a diligent effort was made to recover the erroneous overpayment or it would not be cost effective to recover the erroneous overpayment. The contractor's compliance with a system that is approved under 2146.270(b) will be deemed to be a diligent effort to recover the erroneous overpayment.

              (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in FAR 31.205-41, the portion of the contractor's income or excess profits taxes allocated to the FEGLI Program, except those allocated to the risk charge or the service charge, are allowable costs under the FEGLI Program, including any income or excess profit taxes that arise from the operation of this paragraph. Income or excess profits taxes allocated to the risk charge or the service charge are not allowable costs.

              (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in FAR 31.205-41, an amount equal to the “DAC Tax” is an allowable tax expense under FAR 31.205-41. “DAC Tax” means an amount equal to: (1) the amount of the contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax allocated to payments under the FEGLI Program, less (2) the amount of the contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax allocated to payments under the FEGLI Program computed without regard to the operation of 26 U.S.C. 848, which requires that certain policy acquisition expenses be capitalized over a 60- or 120-month period, plus (3) the amount of the increase, if any, in the contractor's Federal, state, and local income tax that results from the operation of this section 2131.205-41(e).

              Trade, business, technical and professional activity costs.
              (a) FEGLI Program contractors shall seek the advance written approval of the contracting officer for allowability of all or part of the costs associated with trade, business, technical, and professional activities when the allocable costs of such participation to the FEGLI Program will exceed $2,500 annually and the contractor allocates more than 50 percent of the membership cost of a trade, business, technical, or professional organization to the FEGLI Program.
              (b) When approval of costs for membership in an organization is required, the contractor must demonstrate conclusively that membership in such an organization and participation in its activities extend beyond the contractual relationship with OPM, have a reasonable relationship to providing services to FEGLI Program insureds, and that the organization is not engaged in activities such as those cited in FAR 31.205-22 (lobbying costs) for which costs are not allowable.
            
            
              2131.205-70
              Major subcontractor service charge.
              In a subcontract for enrollment and eligibility determinations, administration of claims and payment of benefits and any other subcontract for which prior approval is necessary, when costs are determined on the basis of actual costs incurred, any amount that exceeds the allowable cost of a major subcontract (whether entitled service charge, incentive fee, profit, fee, surplus, or any other title) is not allowable under the contract. Amounts which exceed allowable costs may be paid to a major subcontractor only from the risk charge or service charge negotiated between OPM and the contractor.
            
            
              2131.205-71
              Reinsurer administrative expense costs.
              A charge of $500 per policy year per reinsurer of the FEGLI Program as set forth in the contract is an allowable cost when documented through an internal accounting entry of the contractor and actually paid. This amount is deemed to be sufficient to reimburse reinsurers for the minor administrative expenses incurred in reinsuring the FEGLI Program.

              Recurring premium payments to Contractors.

              (a) OPM will make payments on a letter of credit (LOC) basis. OPM and the Contractor will concur on an estimate of benefits and administrative costs plus the fixed service or risk charge for the forthcoming contract year, as specified in the contract. The annual premium to the Contractor, based on this estimate, will be credited to the Contractor's LOC account in 12 equal monthly installments due on the first business day of each month and available for drawdown. OPM will credit the Contractor's LOC account for the December payment no later than the last business day of each calendar year. Following the close of the contract year, a reconciliation of premiums, benefits, and other costs will be performed as a limited cost redetermination. In addition, interest distribution payments will be made available for Contractor drawdown from the LOC account. The Contractor will use the LOC account in accordance with guidelines issued by OPM.
              (b) Withdrawals from the LOC account for benefit costs of $5,000 or more will be made on a claims-paid basis. Withdrawals from the LOC account for benefit costs of less than $5,000 and other FEGLI Program disbursements will be made on a checks-presented basis. Under a checks-presented basis, drawdown on the LOC is delayed until the checks issued for FEGLI Program disbursements are presented to the Contractor's bank for payment.
              (c) Nothing in this chapter will affect the ability of the Contractor to hold the special contingency reserve established and maintained in accordance with the terms of 5 U.S.C. 8712.

              Tax credit.
              FAR 32.607 has no practical application to FEGLI Program contracts. The statutory provisions at 5 U.S.C. 8707 and 8708 authorize joint enrollee and Government contributions to the Employees' Life Insurance Fund. Because the Fund is comprised of contributions by enrollees as well as the Government, contractors may not offset debts to the Fund by a tax credit that is solely a Government obligation.

              Insurance premium payments and a special contingency reserve are made available to FEGLI Program contractors in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8712 and 8714.

              (a) FEGLI Program funds must be maintained in such a manner as to be separately identifiable from other assets of the Contractor. Cash and investment balances reported on the FEGLI Program Annual Financial Report must be supported by the Contractor's books and records.
              (b) This requirement may be modified by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the clause at 2152.232-71 of this chapter when adequate accounting and other controls are in effect. If the requirement is modified, such modification will remain in effect until rescinded by OPM.

              (a) The services under this contract are of vital interest to the Government and must be continued without interruption in the event the contract is terminated, unless the termination occurs as a result of OPM's failure to pay premiums on a timely basis.
              (b) The Contractor will be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in and phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed-upon period after contract termination that result from phase-in and phase-out operations). The Contractor also will receive a risk or service charge for the full period after contract termination during which services are continued, not to exceed a pro rata portion of the risk or service charge for the final contract year. In addition, OPM will pay the Contractor an incentive amount, not to exceed the pro rata risk or service charge for the continuity of services period (LIFAR 2152.237-70), based on exceptional performance during the transition period to a new Contractor. The Contracting Officer will use the weighted guidelines method described in 2115.404-71 of this chapter in determining the incentive amount. The amount of the risk or service charge will be based upon the accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and validity of customer service complaints, the timeliness and adequacy of reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, insured individuals, beneficiaries, and Congress.

              (a) This part prescribes policies and procedures to ensure that services acquired under the FEGLI Program contract conform to the contract's quality requirements.

              (b) OPM will make an initial evaluation of the Contractor's system of internal controls under the quality assurance program required by 2146.270 of this chapter and will acknowledge in writing whether or not the system is consistent with the requirements set forth in this subpart. After the initial review, subsequent periodic reviews may be limited to changes in the Contractor's internal control guidelines. However, a limited review does not diminish the Contractor's obligation to apply the full internal control system.

              (a) The contractor shall develop and apply a quality assurance program specifying procedures for assuring contract quality, as directed by the contracting officer. At a minimum, the program should include procedures to address:
              (1) Accuracy of payments and recovery of overpayments;
              (2) Timeliness of payments to beneficiaries;
              (3) Quality of services and responsiveness to beneficiaries;
              (4) Quality of service and responsiveness to OPM; and
              (5) Detection and recovery of fraudulent claims.
              (b) The Contractor must prepare overpayment recovery guidelines to include a system of internal controls.
              (c) The contracting officer may order the correction of a deficiency or a modification in the contractor's services and/or quality assurance program. The contractor shall take the necessary action promptly to implement the contracting officer's order. If the contracting officer orders the correction of a deficiency or a modification of the contractor's services and/or quality assurance program pursuant to this paragraph after the contract year has begun, the costs incurred in correcting the deficiency or making the modification will not be considered to the contractor's detriment in the cost control factor of the service charge [if applicable] for the following contract year. However, if there is a deficiency, the deficiency itself may be taken into consideration.

            Applicability.
            (a) Termination. (1) Termination of FEGLI Program contracts is controlled by 5 U.S.C. 8709(c) and this chapter. The procedures for termination of FEGLI Program contracts are contained in FAR part 49. For the purpose of this part, terminate means to discontinue as used in 5 U.S.C. 8709(c).
            (2) A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated by OPM at any time for default by the Contractor in accordance with the provisions of FAR part 49 and FAR 52.249-8. A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated by the Contractor at the end of the grace period, after default for nonpayment by OPM. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Contractor will allow OPM an additional 5 days after the end of the grace period to make payment if the failure to make payment was inadvertent and/or due to circumstances beyond the Government's control.
            (3) A life insurance contract entered into by OPM may be terminated for convenience of the Government 60 days after the Contractor's receipt of OPM's written notice to terminate.
            (4) The Contractor may terminate its contract with OPM at the end of any contract year when notice of intent to terminate is given to OPM in writing at least 60 days prior to the end of the contract year (i.e., no later than July 31).
            (b) Continuation of services. The services under this contract are of vital interest to the Government and must be continued without interruption in the event the contract is terminated for the Contractor's default or OPM's convenience. Consequently, the contract termination procedures contained in this paragraph must be used in conjunction with section 2137.102 of this chapter, section 2137.110 of this chapter, and the provisions of the “Continuity of Services” clause at 2152.237-70 of this chapter. The Contractor is not required to continue performance subsequent to OPM's default for failure to pay premiums in accordance with the provisions of the clause at 2152.249-70(b) of this chapter.
            (c) Settlement. The procedures for settlement of contracts after they are terminated are those contained in FAR part 49.

              As prescribed in 2109.409(a), the contracting officer may require a potential contractor to provide the following certification:
              
                Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Proposed Debarment, and Other Responsibility Matters (OCT 1993)
                (a)(1) The undersigned certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that—
                (i) The undersigned and/or any of its Principals—
                (A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;

                (B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a 3-year period preceding this certification, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property; and
                (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(2) of this clause.
                (ii) The undersigned has ( ) has not ( ), within a 3-year period preceding this certification, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
                (2) “Principals,” for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions).
                This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may render the undersigned subject to prosecution under section 1001, title 18, United States Code.
                (b) The undersigned shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to the contract award, the undersigned learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
                (c) A certification that any of the actions mentioned in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in the withholding of an award under a contract under the FEGLI Program. However, the certification, or the undersigned's failure to provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer will be considered in connection with a determination of the undersigned's responsibility under LIFAR subpart 2109.70, Minimum Standards for FEGLI Program Contractors.
                (d) Nothing contained in this certification shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a). The knowledge and information of the undersigned is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

                (e) The certification in (a) is a material representation of fact upon which reliance is placed during negotiation of a FEGLI Program contract. If it is later determined that the undersigned knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this certification for default.

However, the certification, or the Contractor's failure to provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer will be considered in connection with a determination of the Contractor's responsibility under LIFAR subpart 2109.70, Minimum Standards for FEGLI Program Contractors.

Failed to comply with paragraph (a) or (b) of this clause means:
                (1) Making any charges against the contract which are not actual, allowable, allocable, or reasonable; or

                (d)(1) Investment income lost as a result of unallowable, unallocable, or unreasonable charges against the contract shall be paid from the 1st day of the contract term following the contract term in which the unallowable charge was made and shall end on the earlier of: (i) The date the amounts are returned to OPM; (ii) the date specified by the Contracting Officer; or, (iii) the date of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision.
                (2) Investment income lost by the Contractor as a result of failure to credit income due under the contract or failure to place funds on hand in income-producing investments and accounts must be paid from the date the funds should have been invested or appropriate income was not credited and will end on the earlier of:
                (i) The date the amounts are returned to OPM;
                (ii) The date specified by the Contracting Officer; or
                (iii) The date of the Contracting Officer's final decision.

                (3) The Contractor shall credit to the FEGLI Program income that is due in accordance with this clause. All amounts payable shall bear lost investment income compounded semiannually at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-563), during the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2).
                (4) All amounts due and unpaid after the periods specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) shall bear simple interest at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury until the amount is paid [see FAR 32.614-1].

                (11) Any written exceptions, reservations, or qualifications expressed by the independent accounting firm (which ascribes to the standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) contracted with by the Contractor to provide an audit opinion on the annual financial report required by OPM for the FEGLI Program. Accounting firm employees must audit the report in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards or other requirements issued by OPM.
                (b) Upon learning of a significant event, OPM may institute action, in proportion to the seriousness of the event, to protect the interest of insureds, including, but not limited to—
                (1) Directing the Contractor to take corrective action; or

                Accounting and Allowable Cost (OCT 2005)
                (a) Annual financial report. (1) The Contractor must prepare annually a financial report summarizing the financial operations of the FEGLI Program for the previous contract year. This report will be due to OPM in accordance with a date established by OPM's requirements.
                (2) The Contractor must have the most recent financial report for the FEGLI Program audited by an independent public accounting firm that ascribes to the standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The audit must be performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards or other requirements issued by OPM. The report by the independent accounting firm on its audit must be submitted to OPM along with the annual financial report.
                (3) Based on the results of either the independent audit or a Government audit, the FEGLI contract may be:
                (i) Adjusted by amounts found not to constitute chargeable costs; or
                (ii) Adjusted for prior overpayments or underpayments.
                (b) Definition of costs. (1) A cost is chargeable to the contract for a contract term if it is:
                (i) An actual, allowable, allocable, and reasonable cost;
                (ii) Incurred with proper justification and accounting support;
                (iii) Determined in accordance with subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and subpart 2131.2 of the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Acquisition Regulation (LIFAR) applicable on October 1 of each year; and
                (iv) Determined in accordance with the terms of this contract.
                (2) In the absence of specific contract terms to the contrary, contract costs will be classified in accordance with the following criteria:
                (i) Benefits. Claims costs consist of payments made and costs incurred (including delayed settlement interest) by the Contractor for life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, excess mortality charges, post-mortem conversion charges, and conversion policies on behalf of insured persons, less any overpayments recovered (subject to the terms of LIFAR 2131.205-3), refunds, or other credits received.
                (ii)(A) Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses consist of chargeable costs as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause incurred in the adjudication of claims or incurred in the Contractor's overall operation of the business. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, FAR, or LIFAR, administrative expenses include, but are not limited to, taxes, service charges to reinsurers, the cost of investigation and settlement of policy claims, the cost of maintaining records regarding payment of claims, and legal expenses incurred in the litigation of benefit payments. Administrative expenses exclude the expenses related to investment income in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this clause.
                (B) Administrative expense ceiling. Each year an administrative expense ceiling for the following contract year is calculated based on the prior contract year's administrative expense ceiling, adjusted by the percentage change in the average monthly consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the preceding 12 months. Administrative expenses are reimbursed up to the administrative expense ceiling or actual costs, whichever is less. Both parties will reexamine the base, including the prior year's actual expenses, at the request of either OPM or the Contractor. Within the administrative expense ceiling is a separately negotiated limit for indirect costs that may be charged against the ceiling for the contract year. The Contractor agrees to provide annually to the Contracting Officer a detailed report of direct and indirect administrative costs which form the basis for determining the limit on indirect costs for the following contract year. During a continuity of services period, OPM and the Contractor will negotiate a one-time increase in the administrative expense ceiling to cover phase-in/phase-out costs. Costs that exceed the revised ceiling must be submitted by the Contractor, in writing and in advance of their incurrence, to the Contracting Officer for approval.
                (iii) Investment income. Investment income represents the amount earned by the Contractor after deducting chargeable investment expenses. Investment expenses are those chargeable contract costs, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, which are attributable to the investment of FEGLI funds.
                (c) Certification of Annual Financial Report. (1) The Contractor must certify the annual financial report in the form set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause. The certificate must be signed by the chief executive officer for the Contractor's FEGLI Program operations and the chief financial officer for the Contractor's FEGLI Program operations and must be returned with the annual financial report.
                (2) The certification required must be in the following form:
                Certification of Annual Financial Report
                This is to certify that I have reviewed this financial report and, to the best of my knowledge and belief, attest that:

                3. Income, overpayments, refunds, and other credits made or owed in accordance with the terms of the contract and applicable cost principles have been included in the report.

                Payments (OCT 2005)
                (a) OPM will make available to the Contractor, in full settlement of its obligations under this contract, subject to adjustment based on actual claims and administrative cost, a fixed premium once per month on the first business day of the month. The premium is determined by an estimate of costs for the contract year as provided in Section ____ and is redetermined annually by mutual agreement of OPM and the Contractor. In addition, an annual reconciliation of premiums, benefits, and other costs is performed, and additional payment by OPM or reimbursement by the Contractor is paid as necessary.

                (b) If OPM fails to fund the Letter of Credit (LOC) account for the full amount of premium due by the due date, a grace period of 31 days will be granted to OPM for providing any premium due, unless OPM has previously given written notice to the Contractor that the contract is to be discontinued. The contract will continue in force during the grace period.
                (c) If OPM fails to fund the LOC account for any premiums within the grace period, the contract may be terminated at the end of the 31st day of the grace period in accordance with LIFAR 2149.002(a)(2). If during the grace period OPM presents written notice to the Contractor that the contract is to be terminated before the expiration of the grace period, the contract will be terminated the later of the date of receipt of such written notice by the Contractor or the date specified by OPM for termination. In either event, OPM will be liable to the Contractor for all premiums then due and unpaid.
                (d) In accordance with LIFAR 2143.205 and LIFAR 2252.243-70, Changes, if a change is made to the contract that increases or decreases the cost of performance of the work under this contract, the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment to the payments under this contract.
                (e) In the event this contract is terminated in accordance with LIFAR part 2149, the special contingency reserve held by the Contractor will be available to pay the necessary and proper charges against this contract after other Program assets held by the Contractor are exhausted.

The modification must be requested, and approved by the Contracting Officer, in advance of any change, and the Contractor must demonstrate that accounting techniques have been established that clearly measure FEGLI Program cash and investment income (i.e., subsidiary ledgers). Reconciliations between amounts reported and actual amounts shown in accounting records must be provided as supporting schedules to the annual financial report.

                Continuity of Service (OCT 2005)
                (a) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption. The Contractor further recognizes that upon contract expiration or termination, including termination by the Contractor for OPM's failure to make timely premium payments, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to furnish phase-in training and exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor.
                (b) The Contractor shall, upon the Contracting Officer's written notice, (1) furnish phase-in and phase-out services for up to 10 months after this contract expires and (2) negotiate in good faith a plan with a successor to determine the nature and extent of phase-in and phase-out services required. The plan shall specify a training program and a date for transferring responsibilities for each division of work described in the plan, and shall be subject to the Contracting Officer's approval. The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the phase-in and phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by this contract are maintained at the required level of proficiency.

                (c) The Contractor must allow as many experienced personnel as practicable to remain on the job during the transition period to help the successor maintain the continuity and consistency of the services required by this contract. The Contractor also must, except if prohibited by applicable law, disclose necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct onsite interviews with these employees. If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor must release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor.
                (d) The Contractor will be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after contract termination that result from phase-in and phase-out operations) in accordance with the provisions of the administrative expense ceiling in the clause at 2152.231-70(b)(2)(ii)(B) and a risk charge or a service charge (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the risk or service charge under this contract. The amount of profit will be based upon the accurate and timely processing of benefit claims, the volume and validity of complaints received by OPM, the timeliness and adequacy of reports on operations, and responsiveness to OPM offices, enrollees, beneficiaries, and Congress. In setting the final profit figure, obstacles overcome by the Contractor during the phase-in and phase-out period will be taken into consideration. OPM will pay an incentive amount to the Contractor not to exceed the pro rata risk or service charge for the continuity of services period, if the Contractor has performed exceptionally during the transition period to a new Contractor. The Contracting Officer uses the weighted guidelines method described in LIFAR 2115.404-71 in determining the incentive amount.

                Changes (OCT 2005)
                (a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract in any one or more of the following:
                (1) Description of services to be performed;
                (2) Time of performance (i.e., hours of the day, days of the week, etc.);
                (3) Place of performance of the services.
                (b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, or the Contractor's liability under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.
                (c) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract.
                (d) If the Contractor's proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.
                (e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.
                (f) The Contracting Officer shall not make any changes pursuant to paragraph (a) of this clause to conform this contract to any amendment in the LIFAR before the effective date of the amendment as provided for in LIFAR 2101.370.

                Subcontracts (OCT 2005)
                (a) The Contractor must notify the Contracting Officer reasonably in advance of entering into any subcontract or subcontract modification, or as otherwise specified by this contract, when the cost of that portion of the subcontract that is charged the FEGLI Program contract exceeds $550,000 and is at least 25 percent of the total cost of the subcontract.
                (b) The advance notification required by paragraph (a) of this clause shall include the following information:
                (1) A description of the supplies or services to be subcontracted;
                (2) Identification of the type of subcontract to be used;
                (3) Identification of the proposed subcontract and an explanation of why and how the proposed subcontractor was selected, including the competition obtained;
                (4) The proposed subcontract price and the Contractor's cost or price analysis;

                (5) The subcontractor's current, complete, and accurate cost or pricing data and Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, if required by other contract provisions.
                
                (6) The subcontractor's Disclosure Statement or Certificate relating to Cost Accounting Standards when such data are required by other provisions of this contract; and
                (7) A negotiation memorandum reflecting—
                (i) The principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations;
                (ii) The most significant consideration controlling establishment of initial or revised prices;
                (iii) The reason cost or pricing data were or were not required;
                (iv) The extent, if any, to which the Contractor did not rely on the subcontractor's cost or pricing data in determining the price objective and in negotiating the final price;
                (v) The extent to which it was recognized in the negotiation that the subcontractor's cost or pricing data were not accurate, complete, or current; the action taken by the Contractor and the subcontractor; and the effect of any such defective data on the total price negotiated;
                (vi) The reasons for any significant difference between the Contractor's price objective and the price negotiated; and
                (vii) A complete explanation of the incentive fee or profit plan when incentives are used.

                (c) The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's written consent before placing any subcontract for which advance notification is required under paragraph (a) of this clause. However, the Contracting Officer may ratify in writing any such subcontract. Ratification shall constitute the consent of the Contracting Officer.
                (d) The Contracting Officer may waive the requirement for advance notification and consent required by paragraph (a), (b), and (c) of this clause where the Contractor and subcontractor submit an application or renewal as a contractor team arrangement as defined in FAR subpart 9.6 and—
                (1) The Contracting Officer evaluated the arrangement during negotiation of the contract or contract renewal; and
                (2) The subcontractor's price and/or costs were included in the plan's rates that were reviewed and approved by the Contracting Officer during negotiations of the contract or contract renewal.
                (e) Unless the consent or approval specifically provides otherwise, consent by the Contracting Office to any subcontract shall not constitute a determination (1) of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or conditions; (2) of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or (3) to relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for performing this contract.
                (f) No subcontract placed under this contract will provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis. Any fee payable under cost reimbursement type subcontracts will not exceed the fee limitations in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i). Any profit or fee payable under a subcontract will be in accordance with the provisions of Section ____.
                (g) The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer immediate written notice of any action or suit filed and prompt notice of any claim made against the Contractor by any subcontractor or vendor that, in the opinion of the Contractor, may result in litigation related in any way to this contract with respect to which the Contractor may be entitled to reimbursement from the Government.

                Quality Assurance Requirements (OCT 2005)
                (a) The Contractor shall develop and apply a quality assurance program as directed by the Contracting Officer pursuant to LIFAR 2146.270.
                (b) The Contractor must keep complete records of its quality assurance procedures and the results of their implementation and make them available to an authorized Government entity during contract performance and for 5 years after the end of the contract term to which the records relate.
                (c) The Contracting Officer or his or her representative has the right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all times and places during the term of the contract and for as long afterward as the contract requires. The Contracting Officer or his or her representative shall perform any inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

              2152.249-70
              Renewal and termination.
              As prescribed in 2149.505-70, insert the following clause:
              
                
                Renewal and Termination (OCT 2005)
                (a) This contract renews automatically each October 1st, unless written notice of termination is given by the Contractor not less than 60 calendar days before the renewal date.
                (b) This contract may be terminated by OPM at any time in accordance with FAR part 49 and FAR 52.249-8 for default by the Contractor. This contract terminates at the end of the grace period if the Government does not fund the LOC account for any of the premium due to the Contractor (see LIFAR 2149.002(a)(2)). However, the Contractor and OPM may agree to continue the contract. In addition, the Contractor agrees to reinstate the contract if termination (1) arose out of the Government's inadvertent failure to fund the LOC account for the amount of the premium payment prior to the expiration of the grace period as defined in LIFAR 2102.101, and/or (2) was due to circumstances beyond the Government's control, provided that the LOC account is funded in the amount of the premium payment due to the Contractor within 5 days after the expiration of the grace period. In the event of such reinstatement, OPM will equitably adjust the payments due under the contract to compensate the Contractor for any increased costs of performance that result from the Government's failure to fund the LOC account prior to the expiration of the grace period and/or such reinstatement.
                (c) This contract may be terminated for convenience of the Government 60 days after the Contractor's receipt of OPM's written notice of termination.
                (d) Upon termination of the contract for Contractor's default or OPM's convenience, the Contractor agrees to assist OPM with an orderly and efficient transition to a successor in accordance with LIFAR 2137.102, LIFAR 2137.110, and the provisions of the “Continuity of Services” clause at 2152.237-70. The Contractor is not required to continue performance subsequent to OPM's failure to fund the LOC account for premiums due under paragraph (b) of this clause.
                (e) After receipt of a termination notice, the prime Contractor shall, unless directed otherwise by the Contracting Officer, terminate all subcontracts to the extent that they relate to the performance of the FEGLI Program contract. The failure of the prime Contractor to include an appropriate termination clause in any subcontract, or to exercise the clause rights, shall not affect the Contracting Officer's right to require the termination of the subcontract; or increase the obligation of the Government beyond what it would have been if the subcontract had contained an appropriate clause.

              2301.101
              Purpose.
              (a) The Social Security Acquisition Regulation (SSAR) is issued to establish uniform acquisition policies and procedures for the Social Security Administration (SSA) which conform to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) System.
              (b) The SSAR implements and supplements the FAR. (Implementing material expands upon or indicates the manner of compliance with related FAR material. Supplementing material refers to policies or procedures which have no corresponding counterpart in the FAR.)
              (c) The SSAR contains only formal agency policies and procedures which have a significant effect beyond SSA's internal operating procedures or which have a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.
            
            
              2301.103
              Authority.
              The SSAR is prescribed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 301 and section 205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 486(c)).
            
            
              2301.104
              Applicability.
              The FAR and SSAR apply to all SSA acquisitions as stated in FAR 1.104. Unless specified otherwise, the FAR and SSAR apply to acquisitions within and outside the United States.
            
            
              2301.105
              Issuance.
            
            
              2301.105-1
              Publication and code arrangement.
              (a) The SSAR is also published in the same forms as indicated in FAR 1.105-1(a).
              (b) The SSAR is issued in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as Chapter 23 of Title 48, Social Security Acquisition Regulation (SSAR). It may be referenced as “48 CFR chapter 23.”
            
            
              2301.105-2
              Arrangement of regulations.
              (a) General. The SSAR conforms to the FAR with respect to divisional arrangements; i.e., subchapters, parts, subparts, sections, subsections, and paragraphs.
              (b) Numbering. The FAR System of numbering permits the keying of the same or similar subject matter throughout Chapters 1 (FAR) and 23 (SSAR) of Title 48, CFR. However, SSA's system varies somewhat from that of the FAR numbering scheme, in the numbering to the left of the decimal point. Whereas the FAR only identifies the part number of 48 CFR to the left of the decimal point, our corresponding reference identifies the chapter as well. For example, the FAR paragraph corresponding to this SSAR paragraph is numbered 1.105-2(b) where “1” is the part number (may be one or two digits and is followed by a decimal point), “1” (to the right of the decimal point) is the subpart number, “05” (always two digits) is the section number, “2” is the subsection number (always hyphenated), and “(b)” is the paragraph reference. This SSAR reference is 2301.105-2(b) where the “23” is the chapter number assigned to SSA and the “01” represents the part number (part numbers will always be two digits for agencies implementing the FAR). The remaining numbers to the right of the decimal point are identical to and reflect the same divisions as in the FAR numbering scheme.
              (c) References and citations. (1) Unless otherwise stated, references indicate parts, subparts, sections, subsections, etc., of this regulation, the SSAR.
              (2) This regulation shall be referred to as the Social Security Acquisition Regulation (SSAR). Any reference may be cited as “SSAR” followed by the appropriate number. Within the SSAR, the number alone will be used.
              (3) Citations of authority shall be incorporated where necessary. All FAR reference numbers shall be preceded by “FAR.”

            2401.000
            Scope of part.
            This part describes the method by which the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) implements, supplements and deviates from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) through the establishment of the HUD Acquisition Regulation (HUDAR), which prescribes the Department's procurement policies and procedures under the FAR System.
          
          
            Subpart 2401.1—Purpose, Authority, Issuance
            
              2401.100
              Scope of subpart.
              This subpart describes the HUDAR and states its relationship to the FAR System. This subpart also provides the explanation of the purpose and the authorities under which the HUDAR is issued.
            
            
              2401.101
              Purpose.
              The Department of Housing and Urban Development Acquisition Regulation is hereby established as chapter 24 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation System (48 CFR chapter 24). It is issued to provide uniform Departmental policies and procedures for the acquisition of supplies, personal property and non-personal services by the Department's contracting activities and to make these policies and procedures readily available to Departmental personnel and to the public.
            
            
              2401.103
              Authority.
              The HUDAR is prescribed under section 7(d) of the Department of HUD Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)), section 205(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 486(c)), the general authorization in FAR 1.301, and the Secretary's delegations of procurement authority.

              2401.104
              Applicability.
              All acquisition of personal property and non-personal services (including construction) by HUD, except as may be otherwise authorized by law, must be accomplished in accordance with the HUDAR and the FAR.
              [49 FR 7697, Mar. 1, 1984. Redesignated at 61 FR 19470, May 1, 1996]
            
            
              
              2401.105
              Issuance.
            
            
              2401.105-2
              Arrangement of regulations.
              (a) General. Chapter 24 is divided into parts, subparts, sections, subsections, paragraphs and further subdivisions as necessary.
              (b) Numbering. Generally, the numbering system and part, subpart, and section titles used in the HUDAR conform with those used in the FAR or as follows:
              (1) When the HUDAR implements or deviates from a parallel part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph of the FAR, that implementation or deviation will be numbered and captioned where possible to correspond to the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph. For example, FAR subpart 1.4, Deviations, is implemented in HUD's acquisition regulations at subpart 2401.4, Deviations. (The “24” in the number indicates what chapter of title 48 contains the HUDAR.)
              (2) When HUD supplements material contained in the FAR, it is given a unique number containing the numerals “70” or higher. The rest of the number will parallel the FAR part, subpart, section, subsection, or paragraph it is supplementing. For example, FAR 14.407, Award, does not contain a provision for the steps to be taken when only one bid is received. The HUDAR provides this information. Since the subject matter supplements what is contained in FAR 14.407, the HUDAR section supplementing the FAR is numbered 2414.407-70.
              (3) Where material in the FAR requires no implementation or deviation, there is no corresponding numbering in the HUDAR. Therefore, there may be gaps in the HUDAR sequence of numbers where the FAR, as written, is applicable to the HUDAR and requires no further implementation.
              (c) Citation. The HUDAR will be cited in accordance with Federal Register standards approved for the FAR. Thus, this section when referred to in the HUDAR is cited as 2401.105-2(c). When this section is referred to formally in official documents, such as legal briefs, it should be cited as “48 CFR 2401.105-2(c).” Any section of the HUDAR may be formally identified by the section number, e.g., “HUDAR 2401.105-2.” In the HUDAR, any reference to the FAR will be indicated by “FAR” followed by the section number, for example FAR 37.108.

              2401.106
              OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.
              The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) requires that Federal agencies obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before collecting information from 10 or more persons. HUD has received approval from OMB to collect information under the provisions of its Acquisition Regulation. The OMB Approval Number is 2535-0091.

              2401.106-70
              Contract clause.
              The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 2452.201-70, Coordination of Data Collection Activities, in solicitations and contracts where the Contractor is required to collect information from ten or more public respondents.

              2401.301
              Policy.
              (a)(1) Implementation. The HUDAR implements and supplements the FAR. Implementation material is that which expands upon related FAR material. Supplementing material is that for which there is no counterpart in the FAR.
            
            
              2401.302

              (c) Exclusions. Certain HUD policies and procedures which come within the scope of this chapter are not included in the HUDAR. Not included is a policy or procedure of an internal nature or which is expected to be effective for a period of less than six months.

              Requests for deviations—FAR and HUDAR.
              (a) Requests for deviations from the FAR or HUDAR shall be submitted in writing to the Chief Procurement Officer.
              (b) Each request for authorization of a deviation from the FAR or HUDAR shall:
              (1) Identify the deviation as individual or class;
              (2) Identify the FAR or the HUDAR requirement from which a deviation is sought;
              (3) Fully describe the deviation, its intended effect, and the circumstances in which it will be used;
              (4) Explain why a deviation is required and include pertinent background and supporting information;
              (5) State whether the deviation has been requested previously and if so, the circumstances and result of the previous request; and
              (6) Identify the contractor(s) and the contract(s) (including dollar values) that would be affected.
              (c) At his or her discretion, the Chief Procurement Officer will consider requests for deviations on an expedited basis and, in urgent situations, may authorize deviations via telephone or electronic mail. Such authorizations will be confirmed in writing.
              (d) The contracting officer shall include a copy of each authorized deviation in the contract file(s) to which it pertains.

              (c)(5) Concurrence by legal counsel in the Contracting Officer's recommendation for payment of an unauthorized commitment (see FAR 1.602-3(c)(5)) shall not be required when the value of the payment is equal to, or less than, the simplified acquisition threshold.

              (a) In selecting Contracting Officers, appointing authorities shall consider the experience, education, training, business acumen, judgment, character, reputation, and ethics of the individual to be appointed. Appointing authorities shall also consider the size and complexity of contracts the individual will be required to execute or administer, and any other limitations on the scope of the authority to be exercised.

              (1) The education and specialized experience commensurate with the grade of the appointee as set forth in the qualification standards for the GS-1102 occupational series developed by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 433, and two years of experience performing contracting, procurement, or purchasing operations in a government or commercial procurement office. Alternately, where appointment of a Contracting Officer involves a specialized procurement field, experience in that field may be considered as a criterion for appointment.

              (c) The Senior Procurement Executive may waive education and specialized experience requirements as provided for in the qualification standards developed by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 433.

              Pricing.

              (d) Supplies offered on the schedule are listed at fixed prices. Services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates, or at fixed price for performance of a specific task (e.g., installation, maintenance, and repair). GSA has determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, to be fair and reasonable for the purpose of establishing the schedule contract. GSA's determination does not relieve the ordering activity Contracting Officer from the responsibility of making a determination of fair and reasonable pricing for individual orders, BPAs, and orders under BPAs. Contracting Officers shall follow the general principles and techniques outlined in FAR Section 15.404-1, Proposal Analysis Techniques, to ensure that the final agreed-to price is fair and reasonable, keeping in mind that the complexity and circumstances of each acquisition should determine the level of detail of the analysis required.

              Procedures.
              (a) The Contracting Officer shall perform a financial review when the Contracting Officer does not otherwise have sufficient information to make a positive determination of financial responsibility. In addition, the Contracting Officer shall consider performing a financial review—
              (1) Prior to award of a contract, when—
              (i) The contractor is on a list requiring pre-award clearance or other special clearance before award;
              (ii) The contractor is listed on the Consolidated List of Contractors Indebted to the Government, or is otherwise known to be indebted to the Government;
              (iii) The contractor may receive Government assets such as contract financing payments or Government property;
              (iv) The contractor is experiencing performance difficulties on other work; or
              (v) The contractor is a new company or a new supplier of the item.
              (2) At periodic intervals after award of a contract, when—
              (i) Any of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) through (v) of this section are applicable; or
              (ii) There is any other reason to question the contractor's ability to finance performance and completion of the contract.
              (b) The Contracting Officer shall obtain the type and depth of financial and other information that is required to establish a contractor's financial capability or disclose a contractor's financial condition. While the Contracting Officer should not request information that is not necessary for protection of the Government's interests, the Contracting Officer must insist upon obtaining the information that is necessary. The unwillingness or inability of a contractor to present reasonably requested information in a timely manner, especially information that a prudent business person would be expected to have and to use in the professional management of a business, may be a material fact in the determination of the contractor's responsibility and prospects for contract completion.
              (c) The Contracting Officer shall obtain the following information to the extent required to protect the Government's interest. In addition, if the Contracting Officer concludes that information not listed herein is required to determine financial responsibility, that information should be requested. The information must be for the person(s) who are legally liable for contract performance. If the contractor is not a corporation, the Contracting Officer shall obtain the required information for each individual/joint venturer/partner:
              (1) Balance sheet and income statement—
              (i) For the current fiscal year (interim);
              (ii) For the most recent fiscal year and, preferably, for the 2 preceding fiscal years. These should be certified by an independent public accountant or by an appropriate officer of the firm; and

              (iii) Forecasted for each fiscal year for the remainder of the period of contract performance.
              
              (2) Summary history of the contractor and its principal managers, disclosing any previous insolvencies—corporate or personal, and describing its products or services.
              (3) Statement of all affiliations disclosing—
              (i) Material financial interests of the contractor;
              (ii) Material financial interests in the contractor;
              (iii) Material affiliations of owners, officers, members, directors, major stockholders; and
              (iv) The major stockholders if the contractor is not a widely-traded, publicly-held corporation.
              (4) Statement of all forms of compensation to each officer, manager, partner, joint venturer, or proprietor, as appropriate—
              (i) Planned for the current year;
              (ii) Paid during the past 2 years; and
              (iii) Deferred to future periods.
              (5) Business base and forecast that—
              (i) Shows, by significant markets, existing contracts and outstanding offers, including those under negotiation; and
              (ii) Is reconcilable to indirect cost rate projections.
              (6) Cash forecast for the duration of the contract.
              (7) Financing arrangement information that discloses—
              (i) Availability of cash to finance contract performance;
              (ii) Contractor's exposure to financial crisis from creditor's demands;
              (iii) Degree to which credit security provisions could conflict with Government title terms under contract financing;
              (iv) Clearly stated confirmations of credit with no unacceptable qualifications; and
              (v) Unambiguous written agreement by a creditor if credit arrangements include deferred trade payments or creditor subordinations/repayment suspensions.

              (8) Statement of all state, local, and Federal tax accounts, including special mandatory contributions, e.g., environmental superfund.
              (9) Description and explanation of the financial effect of issues such as—
              (i) Leases, deferred purchase arrangements, or patent or royalty arrangements;
              (ii) Insurance, when relevant to the contract;
              (iii) Contemplated capital expenditures, changes in equity, or contractor debt load;
              (iv) Pending claims either by or against the contractor;
              (v) Contingent liabilities such as guarantees, litigation, environmental, or product liabilities;
              (vi) Validity of accounts receivable and actual value of inventory, as assets; and
              (vii) Status and aging of accounts payable.
              (10) Significant ratios such as—
              (i) Inventory to annual sales;
              (ii) Inventory to current assets;
              (iii) Liquid assets to current assets;
              (iv) Liquid assets to current liabilities;
              (v) Current assets to current liabilities; and
              (vi) Net worth to net debt.

The provision may be used in simplified acquisitions when it is necessary to obtain business proposal information in making the award selection.

              Responsibilities.
              (a)(1) Except as identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, HUD's Chief Procurement Officer, as the Senior Procurement Executive, designates Assistant Secretaries, or their equivalent, for requiring activities as the Source Selection Authorities for selections made using the tradeoff process. Assistant Secretaries may delegate this function to other departmental officials. This designation also applies to acquisitions not performed under the requirements of FAR part 15, but utilizing tradeoff analysis.
              (2) HUD's Chief Procurement Officer, as the Senior Procurement Executive, designates HUD's Office of General Counsel (OGC) as the Source Selection Authority, regardless of contract amount, in all Headquarters procurements for legal services, unless (s)he specifically designates another agency official to perform that function. Any Headquarters office desiring to procure outside legal services for the Department shall obtain OGC approval before advertising or soliciting proposals for such services. OGC shall determine whether the services are necessary and the extent of OGC involvement in the procurement.
              (b)(1) The technical evaluation requirements related to source selection shall be performed by a Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP). The TEP may consist of any number of members as appropriate to the acquisition, with one member serving as the chairperson. As needed, the TEP may include advisors and committees to focus on specific technical areas or concerns. The TEP is responsible for fully documenting the evaluation of all proposals as appropriate to the source selection approach in use and for making the source selection recommendation to the source selection authority.

              (d) The solicitation shall state the basis for the source selection decision as either the “lowest price technically acceptable” (LPTA) process or the dquo;tradeoff” process (as defined at FAR subpart 15.1).

The cost/price portion of each proposal shall be retained by the Contracting Officer pending initial technical evaluation by the TEP.
              (3) Technical evaluation when tradeoffs are performed. The TEP shall rate each proposal based on the evaluation factors specified in the solicitation. The TEP shall identify each proposal as being acceptable, unacceptable but capable of being made acceptable, or unacceptable. A proposal shall be considered unacceptable if it is so clearly deficient that it cannot be corrected through written or oral discussions. Under the tradeoff process, predetermined threshold levels of technical acceptability for proposals shall not be employed. A technical evaluation report, which complies with FAR 15.305(a)(3), shall be prepared and signed by the technical evaluators, furnished to the Contracting Officer, and maintained as a permanent record in the official procurement file.

The Contracting Officer shall ensure that the cost of the work authorized by any unpriced task order is not in excess of the funds available for the order. The Contracting Officer shall establish the time period for the definitization of each unpriced order and insert the anticipated date of definitization in the clause. The HCA shall approve periods that exceed 180 days.
              (b) Minimum and maximum quantities or amounts for order. The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as 2452.216-76, Minimum and Maximum Quantities or Amounts for Order, in all indefinite-quantity and requirements solicitations and contracts. When the clause is used for requirements solicitations and contracts, the contracting officer may either delete paragraph (a) or insert “none” for the minimum quantity or amount.
              (c) Estimated quantities—requirements contract. The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 2452.216-77, Estimated Quantities—Requirements Contract, in all solicitations for requirements contracts.

If the supplies or services to be ordered under the contract are pre-priced in the contract, the orders will be issued on a fixed-price basis, and no order terms are negotiated before issuance, the Contracting Officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I. If the contract provides for the issuance of task orders for services on a negotiated basis (see also 2416.505), the Contracting Officer shall use the clause with its Alternate II.
              (e) Level of effort and fee payment. The Contracting Officer shall insert clause 2452.216-81, Level of Effort and Fee Payment, in all level-of-effort term contracts.

              Contracts.
              (e)(1) The Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) is authorized to approve contract periods for other than information technology contracts that exceed the 5-year limit set forth at FAR 17.204(e) that are not otherwise limited by statute (e.g., the Service Contract Act). Except as provided for in paragraphs (e)(2) and (4) of this section, the SPE shall approve any contract period that will exceed 5 years, including all option periods, prior to the award of the basic contract.
              (2) With regard to HUD indefinite-delivery contracts, the “contract period” requiring the SPE's prior approval in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall mean the ordering period of a contract. Unless otherwise specified within the contract, the 5-year limit shall not apply to the period that any task or delivery order issued within the contract's ordering period extends beyond the final end date of the contract's ordering period, regardless of whether the performance period of the order causes the total period of the contract to exceed 5 years. The issuance of any such task or delivery order does not require the SPE's approval. Task or delivery orders with end dates extending beyond the ordering period of the contract may not exceed the final delivery date that the contracting officer has stated in the applicable indefinite-delivery FAR clause included in the contract (i.e., 52.216-20, “Definite Quantity,” paragraph (d); 52.216-21, “Requirements,” paragraph (f); or 52.216-22, “Indefinite Quantity,” paragraph (d)).
              (3) The SPE's authority described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section shall not be used as the basis to retroactively increase or extend the period of any existing contract.
              (4) The SPE is not required to approve any option properly exercised pursuant to the FAR clause at 52.217-8, “Option to Extend Services,” that extends the contract period beyond 5 years; provided that the total length of all options exercised pursuant to FAR clause 52.217-8 may not exceed 6 months; and provided that exercise of any such options shall be in accordance with FAR 37.111. Any proposed extension of a contract beyond the 6-month maximum permitted by FAR 52.217-8 shall be considered a new requirement and shall be subject to the competition requirements of FAR part 6.

Under the Partnership Agreement, a contract may be awarded directly to an 8(a) firm on either a sole-source or competitive basis. The SBA reserves the right to withdraw the delegation issued as a result of the Partnership Agreement; however, any such withdrawal shall have no effect on contracts already awarded under the Partnership Agreement.

              (a) HUD contracting officers may use the procedures of FAR part 13 and HUDAR part 2413 to make purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold from 8(a) Participants. The following apply to such acquisitions:
              (1) Neither offering letters to, nor acceptance letters from the SBA are required.

              (2) The contracting officer will use the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database on the Internet (http://www.ccr.gov) to establish that the selected 8(a) firm is a current program participant.
              (b) Once an 8(a) contractor has been identified, the contracting officer will establish the price with the selected 8(a) contractor.
              (c) For acquisitions requiring an award document (e.g., purchase order), the contracting officer will:
              (1) Prepare and issue an award document in accordance with the applicable provisions of FAR part 13 and HUDAR part 2413. The applicable clauses prescribed in 2419.811-3 shall be included in the award document. The contracting officer will issue the award document directly to the 8(a) firm; and

              (b) If the acquisition is conducted under the Partnership Agreement cited in 2419.800, HUD is delegated the authority to negotiate directly with the 8(a) participant; however, if requested by the 8(a) participant, the SBA may participate in negotiations.

              (1) The award form shall cite 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) and 15 U.S.C. 637(a) as the authority for use of other than full and open competition.

              (2) The contracting officer shall include appropriate contract clauses, as necessary, to reflect that the acquisition is an 8(a) contract awarded under the authority of the Partnership Agreement cited in 2419.800.
              (3) The contracting officer shall include SBA's requirement number on the contract unless the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.
              (4) A single award document shall be used between HUD and the 8(a) contractor. As such, no signature on the part of the SBA is required; a single signature by the HUD contracting officer shall suffice.

When a problem exists, the Contracting Officer shall request, in writing, the assistance of legal counsel. The request shall detail the problem and be accompanied by appropriate backup data. Counsel shall report to the Contracting Officer as to the necessary disposition of the tax problem. The Contracting Officer will notify the contractor of the outcome of the tax problem.

              As prescribed in 2404.7001, insert the following clause:
              
                Preservation of, and Access to, Contract Records (Tangible and Electronically Stored Information (ESI) Formats) (DEC 2012)
                (a) For the purposes of this clause—
                
                  Contract records means information created or maintained by the contractor in the performance of the contract. Contract records include documents required to be retained in accordance with FAR 4.703 and other information generated or maintained by the contractor that is pertinent to the contract and its performance including, but not limited to: email and attachments, formal and informal correspondence, calendars, notes, reports, memoranda, spreadsheets, tables, telephone logs, forms, survey, books, papers, photographs, drawings, machine-readable materials, and data. Contract records may be maintained as electronically stored information or as tangible materials. Contract records may exist in either final or any interim version (e.g., drafts that have been circulated for official purposes and contain unique information, such as notes, edits, comments, or highlighting). Contract records may be located or stored on the contractor's premises or at off-site locations.
                
                  Electronically stored information (ESI) means any contract records that are stored on, or generated by, an electronic device, or contained in electronically accessible media, either owned by the contractor, subcontractor(s), or employees of the contractor or subcontractor(s) regardless of the physical location of the device or media (e.g., offsite servers or data storage).
                
                  ESI devices and media include, but are not be limited to:
                (1) Computers (mainframe, desktop, and laptop);
                (2) Network servers, including shared and personal drives;
                (3) Individual email accounts of the contractor's principals, officers, and employees, including all folders contained in each email account such as “inbox,” “outbox,” “drafts,” “sent,” “trash,” “archive,” and any other folders;
                (4) Personal data assistants (PDAs);

                (5) External data storage devices including portable devices (e.g., flash drive); and
                (6) Data storage media (magnetic, e.g., tape; optical, e.g., compact disc, microfilm, etc.).
                
                  Tangible materials means contract records that exist in a physical (i.e., non-electronic) state.
                (b) If during the period of performance of this contract, HUD becomes, or anticipates becoming, a party to any litigation concerning matters related to records maintained or generated by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, the Contracting Officer may provide the contractor with a written (either hardcopy or email) preservation hold notice and certification of compliance with the preservation hold notice. Upon receipt of the hold notice, the Contractor shall immediately take the following actions—
                (1) Discontinue any alteration, overwriting, deletion, or destruction of all tangible materials and ESI.

                (2) Preserve tangible materials and ESI. The contractor shall preserve ESI in its “native” form to preserve metadata (i.e., creation and modification history of a document).
                (3) Identify all individuals who possess or may possess tangible materials and ESI related to this matter, including contractor employees, subcontractors, and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall provide the names of all such individuals via email to the HUD official indicated in the notice.

                (4) Document in writing the contractor's efforts to preserve tangible materials and ESI. It may be useful to maintain a log documenting preservation efforts.
                
                (5) Complete the certification of compliance with the preservation hold notice upon receipt and return it to the identified contact person; and
                (6) Upon the request of the Contracting Officer, provide the Contracting Officer or other HUD official designated by the Contracting Officer with any of the information described in this clause. The contractor shall immediately confirm receipt of such request. The contractor shall describe in detail any records that the contractor knows or believes to be unavailable and provide a detailed explanation of why they are unavailable, and if known, their location.
                (c)(1) If any request for records pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this clause causes an increase in the estimated cost or price or the time required for performance of any part of the work under this contract, or otherwise affects any other terms and conditions of this contract, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.

                (2) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within __ [Contracting Officer insert period; 30 days if no other period inserted] from the date of receipt of the Contracting Officer's request made pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this clause. However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a request submitted before final payment of the contract.
                (3) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the “Disputes” clause of this contract. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the contractor from providing the records requested by the Contracting Officer.
                (e) The Contractor shall include this clause in all subcontracts.

                (e) Refusal to provide the requested information or the willful misrepresentation of any relevant information by an offeror shall disqualify the offeror from further consideration for award of a contract under this solicitation.

                (iii) If either the failure of the Government to provide information to the Contractor by the dates shown in this clause or the remedial action taken under this clause to correct defective information causes an increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of the work under this contract, the Contracting Officer shall consider an equitable adjustment to the contract. The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer its written statement describing the general nature and amount of the equitable adjustment proposal within 30 days after the remedial action described in paragraph (ii) herein is completed, or within 30 days after the date upon which the Government failed to provide information, unless the Contracting Officer extends this period.

                (2) In the event of any loss, theft, damage, or destruction of Government information, the Contractor shall immediately take all reasonable actions necessary to protect the Government information from further loss, theft, damage, or destruction.

                (3) When required to return Government information to the Government, the Contractor shall do so at no cost to the Government. The Government shall not be responsible for the cost of data format conversion and the cost of delivery, if any.

                Limitation of Government's Obligation (DEC 2012)
                (a) Funds are not available for full funding of all contract line items under this contract. The incrementally funded line items and their anticipated funding schedule are as follows:

                The contracting officer will revise this table as funds are allotted to the contract.

                (b) For the incrementally funded line item(s) in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract for these contract line items. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on the incrementally funded line item(s) beyond that point. The Government will in no event be obligated to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for the incrementally funded line item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.” As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination for convenience of applicable line item(s) includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those line item(s).

                (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least __ [90 days unless the Contracting Officer inserts a different number] days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable line item(s). This notification will state: the estimated date when that point will be reached; and an estimate of the amount of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of the applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (a) of this clause (or to another mutually agreed-upon date). The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the line item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (a) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed-upon date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any line item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”
                (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the incrementally funded line item(s), the parties will agree to the period of contract performance covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed-upon date(s), and the contract will be modified accordingly.

                (e) If the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract solely by reason of the failure of the Government to allot additional funds in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the incrementally funded line item(s), and then additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the line item price(s) or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder shall be considered a dispute subject to the “Disputes” clause in this contract.
                
                (f) The Government may allot additional funds for the performance of the incrementally-funded line item(s) at any time prior to termination.

                (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default.” The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the incrementally funded line item(s) and will no longer apply once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.

                (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”
                (i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.

The total obligation of funds available at this time for performance of work or deliveries is [insert amount]. The Government shall not order, nor shall the contractor be authorized or required to accept orders for, or perform work on such orders (or perform any other work on this contract) or make deliveries that exceed the stated funding limit.
                (b) When funding is available, the Government may unilaterally increase the amount obligated through contract funding modification(s) until the full contract value has been obligated. If a contract funding modification is not in place by the time the performance of the work or deliveries have reached the stated funding limit, the contractor must stop performing services and deliveries and may not start again until the contractor is notified through a contract funding modification that funds are available to continue services and deliveries.

              Access to HUD facilities.
              As prescribed in 2437.110(e)(3), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts:
              
                ACCESS TO HUD FACILITIES (APR 2019)
                (a) Definitions. As used in this clause—
                “Access” means physical entry into and, to the extent authorized, mobility within a Government facility.
                “Contract” means any authorized contractual instrument, including, but not restricted to, task orders, purchase orders, Blanket Purchase Agreement calls, etc.
                “Contractor employee” means an employee of the prime contractor or of any subcontractor, affiliate, partner, joint venture, or team members with which the Contractor is associated. It also includes consultants engaged by any of those entities.
                “Facility” and “Government facility” mean buildings, including areas within buildings that are owned, leased, shared, occupied, or otherwise controlled by the Federal Government.
                “NACI” means National Agency Check with Inquiries, the minimum background investigation prescribed by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.
                “PIV Card” means the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card, the Federal Government-issued identification credential (identification badge).
                (b) General. The performance of this contract requires contractor employees to have access to HUD facilities. All such employees who do not already possess a current PIV Card acceptable to HUD shall be required to provide personal background information, undergo a background investigation (NACI or other OPM-required or approved investigation), including an FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check, and obtain a PIV Card prior to being permitted access to any such facility in the performance of this contract.
                Unescorted access to any such facility in performance of this contract. HUD may accept a PIV Card issued by another Federal Government agency but shall not be required to do so. No contractor employee will be permitted unescorted access to a HUD facility without a proper PIV Card.
                (c) Background information. (1) For each contractor employee subject to the requirements of this clause and not in possession of a current PIV Card acceptable to HUD, the Contractor shall submit the following properly completed forms: Electronic Standard Form (SF) 85, “Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions via e-QIP,” completed USAccess enrollment (electronic fingerprinting) and Optional Form (OF) 306 (Items 1 through 17). Forms SF-85 and OF-306 are available from OPM's website, http://www.opm.gov. The electronic questionnaire is available on OPM's e-QIP site, https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/. The COR will provide all other forms that are not obtainable via the internet.
                (2) The Contractor shall deliver the forms and information required in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause to the COR as secure as possible.
                (3) The information provided in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this clause will be used to perform a background investigation to determine the suitability of the contractor employees to have access to Government facilities. After completion of the investigation, the COR will notify the Contractor in writing when any contractor employee is determined to be unsuitable for access to a Government facility. The Contractor shall immediately remove such employee(s) from work on this contract that requires physical presence in a Government facility.
                (4) Affected contractor employees who have had a Federal background investigation without a subsequent break in Federal employment or Federal contract service exceeding 2 years may be exempt from the investigation requirements of this clause subject to verification of the previous investigation. For each such employee, the Contractor shall submit the following information in lieu of the forms and information listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause: completed PIV and Pre-Security Form.
                (d) PIV Cards. (1) HUD will issue a PIV Card to each contractor employee who is to be given access to HUD facilities and who does not already possess a PIV Card acceptable to HUD (see paragraph (b) of this clause). HUD will not issue the PIV Card until the contractor employee has (1) successfully cleared the FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check, (2) HUD has initiated the background investigation for the contractor employee, and (3) a Security Approval Notice from HUD PSD via PSDContractorIn-box@hud.gov has been received. Initiation is defined to mean that all background information required in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause has been delivered to HUD. The employee may not be given access prior to those three events. HUD may issue a PIV Card and grant access pending the completion of the background investigation. HUD will revoke the PIV Card and the employee's access if the background investigation process for the employee, including adjudication of the investigation results, has not been completed within 6 months after the issuance of the PIV Card.
                (2) PIV Cards shall identify individuals as contractor employees. Contractor employees shall display their PIV Cards on their persons at all times while working in a HUD facility, and shall present cards for inspection upon request by HUD officials or HUD security personnel.

                (3) The Contractor shall be responsible for all PIV Cards issued to the Contractor's employees and shall immediately notify the COR if any PIV Card(s) cannot be accounted for. The Contractor shall promptly return PIV Cards to HUD, as required by the FAR clause at 52.204-9. The Contractor shall notify the COR immediately whenever any contractor employee no longer has a need for his/her HUD-issued PIV Card (e.g., employee terminates employment with the contractor, employee's duties no longer require access to HUD facilities). The COR will instruct the Contractor on how to return the PIV Card, and upon expiration of this contract, the COR will instruct the Contractor on how to return all HUD-issued PIV Cards not previously returned. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not return PIV Cards to any person other than the COR.
                (4) The Contractor shall submit a report to the Contracting Officer and COR no later than five (5) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter that provides the status of each employee who is required to work in a HUD facility during the performance of the contract. At a minimum, the report shall identify the contractor and the contract number, and list for each employee the following information:
                (i) Employee name;
                (ii) Name of HUD facility where employee works;
                (iii) Date background check submitted;
                (iv) Date PIV Card issued;
                (v) PIV card number;
                (vi) Date employee no longer has need of the HUD PIV Card;
                (vii) Date Contracting Officer and COR were notified that employee no longer had need of the HUD PIV Card; and
                (viii) Date PIV Card was returned to COR.
                (e) Control of access. HUD shall have, and exercise, complete control over granting, denying, withholding, and terminating access of contractor employees to HUD facilities. The COR will notify the Contractor immediately when HUD has determined that an employee is unsuitable or unfit to be permitted access to a HUD facility. The Contractor shall immediately notify such employee that he/she no longer has access to any HUD facility, remove the employee from any such facility that he/she may be in, and provide a suitable replacement in accordance with the requirements of this clause.
                
                (f) Access to HUD information systems. If this contract requires contractor employees to have access to HUD information system(s), application(s), or information contained in such systems, the Contractor shall comply with all requirements of HUDAR clause 2452.239-70, Access to HUD Systems, including providing for each affected employee any additional background investigation forms prescribed in that clause.
                (g) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall incorporate this clause in all subcontracts where the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section are applicable to performance of the subcontract.

                (b)(1) HUD may close a HUD facility for all or a portion of a business day as a result of—

                (A) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be equal to the per month contract price divided by the number of business days in each month.
                (B) The deduction rate in dollars per day will be multiplied by the number of days services are not required or provided.
                If services are provided for portions of days, appropriate adjustment will be made by the Contracting Officer to ensure that the contractor is compensated for services provided.
                (2) For cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials and labor-hour type contracts, HUD shall not reimburse as direct costs, the costs of salaries or wages of contractor personnel for the period during which such personnel are dismissed from, or do not have access to, the facility.

                (d) Background investigation process. (1) The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) shall notify the Contractor of those contractor employee positions requiring background investigations.

                (i) For each contractor employee requiring access to HUD information systems, the Contractor shall submit the following properly completed forms: Electronic Standard Form (SF) 85, “Questionnaire for Non-sensitive Positions” via e-QIP, completed USAccess enrollment (electronic fingerprinting) and Optional Form (OF) 306 (Items 1 through 17).

                (iii) The electronic questionnaires (e-QIP) SF-85, 85P, and OF-306 are available from OPM's websites https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/ and http://www.opm.gov. The COR will provide all other forms that are not obtainable via the internet.
                (2) The Contractor shall deliver the forms and information required in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause to the COR as securely as possible.
                (3) Affected contractor employees who have had a Federal background investigation without a subsequent break in Federal employment or Federal contract service exceeding 2 years may be exempt from the investigation requirements of this clause, subject to verification of the previous investigation. For each such employee, the Contractor shall submit the following information in lieu of the forms and information listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause: PIV and Pre-Security Form.
                (4) The investigation process shall consist of a range of personal background inquiries and contacts (written and personal) and verification of the information provided on the investigative forms described in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause.
                (5) Upon completion of the investigation process, the COR will notify the Contractor if any contractor employee is determined to be unsuitable to have access to the system(s), application(s), or information. Such an employee may not be given access to those resources. If any such employee has already been given access pending the results of the background investigation, the Contractor shall ensure that the employee's access is revoked immediately upon receipt of the COR's notification.
                (6) Failure of the COR to notify the Contractor (see paragraph (d)(1) of this clause) of any employee who should be subject to the requirements of this clause and is known, or should reasonably be known, by the Contractor to be subject to the requirements of this clause, shall not excuse the Contractor from making such employee(s) known to the COR. Any such employee who is identified and is working under the contract, without having had the appropriate background investigation or furnished the required forms for the investigation, shall cease to perform such work immediately and shall not be given access to the system(s)/application(s) described in paragraph (b) of this clause until the Contractor has provided the investigative forms to the COR for the employee, as required in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause.
                (7) The Contractor shall notify the COR in writing whenever a contractor employee for whom a background investigation package was required and submitted to HUD, or for whom a background investigation was completed, terminates employment with the Contractor, or otherwise is no longer performing work under this contract that requires access to the system(s), application(s), or information. The Contractor shall provide a copy of the written notice to the Contracting Officer.
                (e) PIV Cards. (1) HUD will issue a PIV Card to each contractor employee who is to be given access to HUD systems and does not already possess a PIV Card acceptable to HUD (see paragraph (b) of this clause). HUD will not issue the PIV Card until the contractor employee has (1) successfully cleared an FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check, (2) HUD has initiated the background investigation for the contractor employee, and (3) a Security Approval Notice from HUD PSD via PSDContractorIn-box@hud.gov has been received. Initiation is defined to mean that all background information required in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause has been delivered to HUD. The employee may not be given access prior to those three events. HUD may issue a PIV Card and grant access pending the completion of the background investigation. HUD will revoke the PIV Card and the employee's access if the background investigation process for the employee, including adjudication of the investigation results, has not been completed within 6 months after the issuance of the PIV Card.
                (2) PIV Cards shall identify individuals as contractor employees. Contractor employees shall display their PIV Cards on their persons at all times while working in a HUD facility, and shall present cards for inspection upon request by HUD officials or HUD security personnel.

                (3) The Contractor shall be responsible for all PIV Cards issued to the Contractor's employees and shall immediately notify the COR if any PIV Card(s) cannot be accounted for. The Contractor shall promptly return PIV Cards to HUD as required by the FAR clause at 52.204-9. The Contractor shall notify the COR immediately whenever any contractor employee no longer has a need for his/her HUD-issued PIV Card (e.g., the employee terminates employment with the Contractor, the employee's duties no longer require access to HUD systems). The COR will instruct the Contractor as to how to return the PIV Card. Upon expiration of this contract, the COR will instruct the Contractor as to how to return all HUD-issued PIV Cards not previously returned. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not return PIV Cards to any person other than the COR.
                
                (4) The Contractor shall submit a report to the Contracting Officer and COR no later than five (5) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter that provides the status of each employee who is required to work in a HUD facility during the performance of the contract. At a minimum, the report shall identify the Contractor and the contract number, and list for each employee the following information:
                (i) Employee name;
                (ii) Name of HUD facility where employee works;
                (iii) Date background check submitted;
                (iv) Date PIV Card issued;
                (v) PIV card number;
                (vi) Date employee no longer has need of the HUD PIV Card;
                (vii) Date Contracting Officer and COR were notified that employee no longer has need of the HUD PIV Card; and
                (viii) Date PIV Card returned to COR.
                (f) Control of access. HUD shall have and exercise full and complete control over granting, denying, withholding, and terminating access of contractor employees to HUD systems.

              As prescribed in HUDAR Section 2444.204(a), insert the following clause in contracts and task orders with an estimated value exceeding $10,000,000.
              
                Consent to Subcontract (Mar 2016)
                (a) Due to the substantive nature of subcontracting that may be necessary during performance of this contract, the Contracting Officer has determined that a consent for individual subcontracts is required to adequately protect the Government. Consent is required for -
                (1) Cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, or labor-hour subcontracts, or combination of such, in excess of $150,000 per year to a single subcontractor or consultant;

                (b) If subcontracts meeting the above parameters were not provided during the negotiation of the original contract award, the Contractor shall obtain post award consent and provide signed copies of the subcontract agreements within 10 days of consent.
                (c) The Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with 30 days advance notification prior to changing subcontractors or existing subcontracting agreements, unless precluded due to circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. If advance notification is not feasible, the Contractor shall provide notification to the Contracting Officer no later than 10 days after the Contractor identifies the need to replace a subcontractor. The notification shall include a copy of the proposed new subcontracting agreement. Upon consent and finalization of the final subcontract agreement, the Contractor shall provide a copy of the signed agreement to the Contracting Officer.
                (d) The Contracting Officer's consent to a subcontract does not constitute a determination of the acceptability of the subcontract terms or price, or of the allowability of costs.
                (e) If not required elsewhere in the contract, no more than 30 calendar days after award, the Contractor shall provide a separate continuity of services plan to the Contracting Officer that will ensure services performed by subcontractors that cost more than 25% of the cost/price of the contract will continue uninterrupted in the event of performance problems or default by the subcontractor.

              (b) Application. When an NSF contract is for scientific activities which are determined by the NSF contracting officer to be “necessary to carry out the purposes of the NSF Act,” then 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15) is applicable and the contract may be entered into through negotiation rather than formal advertising. The Foundation's contracting officer may, in lieu of reliance on 42 U.S.C. 1870(c) and 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15), utilize other applicable negotiating authorities at his or her discretion. 42 U.S.C. 1870(c) and 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(15) may also be used to authorize negotiation if the Foundation is carrying out, “at the request of the Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense, specific scientific activities in connection with matters relating to international cooperation or national security.” Contracts or their modifications entered into under this authority may be done so without legal consideration and without performance or other bonds.

              NSF patent policy.
              As authorized by the National Science Board at its 230th meeting, October 15-16, 1981, the Director of the National Science Foundation has adopted the following statement of NSF patent policy.
              (a) In accordance with by the Bayh-Dole Act and the Presidential Memorandum entitled “Government Patent Policy” issued February 18, 1983, the Foundation will use the Patent Rights clause prescribed by the Department of Commerce in all its funding agreements for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work, including awards made to foreign entities, unless the Foundation determines that some other provision would better serve the purposes of that Act or the interests of the United States and the general public.
              (b) In funding agreements covered by a treaty or agreement that provides that an international organization or foreign government, research institute, or inventor will own or share patent rights, the Foundation will acquire such patent rights as are necessary to comply with the applicable treaty or agreement.
              (c) If an awardee elects not to retain rights to an invention, the Foundation will allow the inventor to retain the principal patent rights unless the awardee, or the inventor's employer if other than the awardee, shows that it would be harmed by that action.
              (d) The Foundation will normally allow any patent rights not wanted by the awardee or inventor to be dedicated to the public through publication in scientific journals or as a statutory invention registration. However, if another Federal agency is known to be interested in the relevant technology, the Foundation may give it an opportunity to review and patent the invention so long as that does not inhibit the dissemination of the research results to the scientific community.

              Applicability.
              Advance payments may be made in any amount not exceeding the contract price, provided (a) the amount of the advance payment is based upon an analysis of the financing required by the contractor for the contract and does not exceed reasonable financial requirements between payments, and (b) such advance payment is appropriate in order to contract for the required work.

              2801.101
              Purpose.
              (a) The Justice Acquisition Regulations (JAR) in this chapter are established to provide procurement regulations that supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR chapter 1. As such, the regulations contained in the JAR will include coverage of only those areas where agency implementation is required by the FAR, or where Department of Justice (DOJ) policies and procedures exist that supplement FAR coverage and directly affect the contractual relationship between the Department and potential or existing contractors. The JAR will not repeat FAR coverage.
              (b) The FAR contains many references to agency procedures. If the JAR does not include supplemental guidance under the corresponding part or subpart, it is because the FAR language is considered to be sufficient. In those instances where the JAR states “in accordance with bureau procedures,” it does not mean that the bureau must have a procedure. It is intended that the bureau procedures are to be followed if they exist, however, it does not mean that the bureau must have a formal written procedure. Where both the JAR and bureau procedures do not address a FAR subject, the FAR guidance is to be followed.
              (c) The JAR is not a complete system of regulations and must be used in conjunction with the FAR.
            
            
              2801.106
              OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act.
              The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) and the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320, require that reporting and record keeping requirements affecting 10 or more members of the public be cleared by that office. The OMB control number for the collection of information under 48 CFR chapter 28 is 1103-0018.

              2801.270-1
              Revisions.
              In addition to changes published in the Federal Register, the JAR will be amended by issuance of Justice Acquisition Circulars (JACs) containing loose-leaf replacement pages which revise parts, subparts, sections, subsections, paragraphs or subparagraphs. A vertical bar (edit bar) at the beginning or end of a line indicates that a change has been made within that line.

              Agency control and compliance procedures.
              Pursuant to FAR 1.304, the Procurement Executive (PE) is responsible for ensuring that bureau acquisition regulations and directives do not restrain the flexibilities found in the FAR. For this reason, bureau acquisition regulations shall be forwarded to the PE upon issuance. The PE reserves the right to revoke the regulations and directives in this chapter if they are determined to be restrictive.

              2801.403
              Individual deviations.
              Individual deviations from the FAR or the JAR shall be approved by the head of the contracting activity (HCA). A copy of the deviation shall be included in the contract file. Copies of all deviations will be provided to the PE.
            
            
              2801.404
              Class deviations.
              Requests for class deviations from the FAR or the JAR shall be submitted to the PE. The PE will consult with the chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council, as appropriate, and send his/her recommendations to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration (AAG/A). The AAG/A will grant or deny requests for such deviations. For the purposes of this chapter, requests for deviations involving basic ordering agreements, master type contracts, or situations where multiple awards are made from one solicitation, are considered to involve more than one contract and therefore considered to be class deviation requests.
            
            
              2801.470
              Requests for class deviations.
              Requests for approval of class deviations from the FAR or the JAR shall be forwarded to the PE. Such requests will be signed by the Bureau Procurement Chief (BPC). Requests for class deviations shall be submitted as far in advance as the exigencies of the situation permit and shall contain sufficient written justification to evaluate the request.
            
          
          
            Subpart 2801.6—Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities
            
              2801.601
              General.
              (a) In accordance with Attorney General Order 1687-93, the authority vested in the Attorney General with respect to contractual actions, for goods and services, is delegated to the following officials:
              (1) AAG/A (for the offices, boards, and divisions (OBDs);
              (2) Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation;
              (3) Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons;
              (4) Commissioner, Federal Prison Industries;
              (5) Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service;
              (6) Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration;
              (7) Assistant Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs;
              (8) Director, U.S. Marshals Service;
              (9) Inspector General, Office of the Inspector General.
              (b) The acquisition authority delegated to the officials in 2801.601(a) may be redelegated to subordinate officials as necessary for the efficient and proper administration of the Department's acquisition operations. Such redelegated authority shall expressly state whether it carries the power of redelegation of authority.

              (c) The redelegation of contracting authority directly to specific persons without regard for intermediate organizational levels only establishes authority to represent the Government in its commercial business dealings. It is not intended to affect the organizational relationship between the contracting officers and higher administrative and supervisory levels in the performance of their duties.

              The HCA may delegate the authority to ratify unauthorized commitments to the chief of the contracting office, except for those actions effected by his or her office. Dollar thresholds for delegations made under this section will be determined by the HCA. Copies of all ratifications are to be provided to the PE.

              Department of Justice Acquisition Career Management Program.
              (a) Each Bureau Procurement Chief shall develop and manage an acquisition career management program for contracting personnel in his or her component, consistent and uniform with this section and the Department of Justice Acquisition Procurement Career Management Program.
              (b) The program shall cover all contracting personnel in the following categories:
              (1) General Schedule (GS-1102) Contracting Series;
              (2) Contracting officers, regardless of General Schedule Series, with contracting authority above the simplified acquisition threshold;
              (3) Purchasing Series (GS-1105), other individuals performing purchasing duties and individuals with contracting authority between the micro purchase and simplified acquisition thresholds.
              (4) All Contracting Officer Representatives/Contracting Officer Technical Representatives, or equivalent positions.
              (c) The program shall include:
              (1) Management information system. Standardized information on the acquisition workforce will be collected and maintained. To the maximum extent practicable, such data requirements shall conform to the standards established by the Office of Personnel Management for the Central Personnel Data File and shall be compatible with the Department of Justice acquisition workforce management information system.
              (2) Individual assessments and development plans for personnel in the GS-1102 contracting series. (i) An individual assessment by a supervisor of each covered employee's state of competence to perform the full range of potential duties of his or her job; and
              (ii) An individual development plan to schedule classroom, on-the-job training, or other training to develop the employee's skill level to an appropriate level in each area of competence necessary to perform his or her job.
              (iii) Individual assessments and development plans should be designed to fit the needs of the component, but they should be built upon the units of competence and instruction prepared by the Federal Acquisition Institute whenever feasible. Individual development plans should attempt to bring the employee to an appropriate level of skill in all necessary competencies in the field of procurement. In general, a proficiency skill level of 3, as defined in Attachment 1 to Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 92-3, shall be obtained for any contracting duty that is actually required to be performed on the job. Individual assessments and development plans should be reviewed annually and revised as appropriate, until the employee reaches the full competency level of his or her job.
              (iv) Employees who perform only purchasing duties, regardless of occupational series, shall be required to obtain the requisite level of skill only in competencies involving simplified acquisitions. If the employee's duties are expanded to include contracting duties, then skill in procurement competencies must be assessed and developed.
              (v) Individual assessments of covered employee skills shall be completed within 90 days of the employee's entry on duty.
              (3) Mandatory training. Training shall be provided for the identified categories of contracting personnel to meet the minimum standards identified in OFPP Policy Letter 97-01.
              
              (4) Skills currency. Contract Specialists (GS-1102) and contracting officers with authority to obligate funds above the micro-purchase threshold that have satisfied the mandatory training requirements, shall be provided the equivalent of at least 40 hours of continuing procurement and acquisition related education and training every two years for the purpose of maintaining the currency of acquisition knowledge and skills.
              (5) Program funding. Bureau Procurement Chiefs are responsible for assessing the funding needs to provide for the education and training of their acquisition workforce and requesting such funding in the annual budget process.
            
            
              2801.603-3
              Appointment.
              Contracting officers whose authority will be limited to micro-purchases shall be appointed in writing and include any limitations to that authority.
            
          
          
            Subpart 2801.70—Contracting Officer's Technical Representative
            
              2801.7001-701
              General.
              Contracting officers may appoint individuals selected by program offices to act as authorized representatives in the monitoring and administration of a contract. Such officials shall be designated as Contracting Officers' Technical Representatives (COTR's).
            
            
              2801.7001-702
              Selection, appointment, and limitation of authority.
              (a) COTR standards program. This subpart sets forth policies and procedures for establishing standards for COTR's in DOJ. The program sets forth minimum standards for individuals to be eligible for an appointment as a COTR.
              (b) Applicability. The eligibility requirements of this subpart apply to all individuals who are designated by the contracting officer as COTR's.
              (c) Eligibility standards. To be determined eligible for an appointment as a DOJ COTR, the following standards must be met:
              (1) The candidate must attend and successfully complete a minimum of a 16-hour basic COTR course; and
              (2) The candidate must attend a minimum of 1 hour training specifically in procurement ethics, either through courses offered periodically by the Department, the bureaus, or a Government or commercial vendor.
              (d) Limitations. Each COTR appointment made by the contracting officer shall clearly state that the representative is not an authorized contracting officer and does not have the authority under any circumstances to:
              (1) Award, agree to award, or execute any contract, contract modification, notice of intent, or other form of binding agreement;
              (2) Obligate, in any manner, the payment of money by the Government;
              (3) Make a final decision on any contract matter which is subject to the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes; or
              (4) Terminate, suspend, or otherwise interfere with the contractor's right to proceed, or direct any changes in the contractor's performance that are inconsistent with or materially change the contract specifications.
              (e) Termination. Termination of the COTR's appointment shall be made in writing by the contracting officer and shall give the effective date of the termination. The contracting officer shall promptly modify the contract once a COTR termination notice has been issued.

In the rare event that there is an urgent requirement for a specific individual to serve as a COTR and the individual has not successfully completed the required training, the BPC may waive the training requirements and authorize the individual to perform the COTR duties, for a period of time not to exceed 120 days. The waiver will be granted in accordance with bureau procedures.
              (g) COTR clause. The clause at 2852.201-70 is required in all contracts where a COTR is designated.

To the maximum extent practicable, contractors shall be made responsible for the performance of personnel security screening. The personnel security screening may vary from one acquisition to another, depending upon the type, context, duration and location of the work to be performed. Classified contracts are exempted from the requirements of this section because they are governed by the requirements of Executive Order 12829 (January 6, 1993).

              (c) The Security Program Manager for the acquiring component is responsible for monitoring and ensuring that the contractor personnel security requirements of the contract are accomplished.
              (d) For purposes of this section, the term Contracting Officer includes anyone empowered to place orders under Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) or any other existing contract vehicle and/or through the use of the government-wide commercial purchase card.

                Confidential contract, as used in this subpart, means a contract, the reporting of which to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as required under 26 U.S.C. 6050M, would interfere with the effective conduct of a confidential law enforcement activity, such as contracts for sites for undercover operations or contracts with informants, or foreign counterintelligence activity.

              2807.102
              Policy.
              (a)(1) In accordance with FAR 7.1, DOJ contracting activities shall perform acquisition planning and conduct market research for all acquisitions in order to promote and provide for:
              (i) Full and open competition (see FAR part 6);
              (ii) Maximum practicable competition for those acquisitions where full and open competition is not required by FAR part 6; and
              (iii) The acquisition of commercial items or, when commercial items are not available, nondevelopmental items to the maximum extent practicable.

              (2) The degree of planning and market research may vary, depending on such factors as the acquisition's size, scope and complexity.
              
              (b) Acquisition planning shall be the joint responsibility of both the contracting and program offices. All acquisition plans shall be prepared sufficiently in advance of solicitation release dates to ensure that requirements are presented in a way that promotes full and open competition and provides sufficient time for the identification and resolution of impediments that could delay the acquisition or lead to increased cost or technical risk.
            
            
              2807.102-70
              Applicability.
              (a) Planning commensurate with the complexity and dollar value of the individual requirement shall be performed for all acquisitions, except for those acquisitions listed in paragraph (c) of this subsection which may be exempt from the planning process. Heads of contracting activities may authorize the use of oral plans for simple and/or small dollar acquisitions. When oral plans are used, the file should be documented with the name of the individual who approved the plan.
              (b) Written acquisition plans shall be prepared for all major systems acquisitions as defined in 2834.002.
              (c) The following types of acquisitions may be exempt from the acquisition planning program;
              (1) Architect-engineering services;
              (2) Unsolicited proposals (when deemed innovative and unique in accordance with FAR 15.5);
              (3) Regulated utility services where services are available from only one source;
              (4) Acquisitions made from or through other Government agencies; and
              (5) Contract modifications which exercise an option or add funds to an incrementally funded contract (provided there is an approved acquisition planning document for the original action and there is no significant deviation from that plan).
            
            
              2807.103
              Agency-head responsibilities.
              The AAG/A may establish acquisition planning criteria and thresholds for those bureaus who:
              (a) Fail to allow ample time for conducting competitive acquisitions;
              (b) Develop a pattern of awarding urgent requirements that generally restrict competition;
              (c) Fail to identify identical or like requirements that, where appropriate, can be combined under one solicitation and miss opportunities to obtain lower costs through volume purchasing, reduce administrative costs in processing one contract action versus multiple actions, and standardize goods and services.
            
            
              2807.103-70
              Other officials' responsibilities.
              (a) In accordance with FAR 7.1, the HCA shall develop an acquisition planning program for all acquisitions to ensure that its needs are met in the most effective, economical, the timely manner.
              (b) Heads of contracting activities have the flexibility to develop programs that are best suited to their individual needs. Criteria and thresholds shall be established at which increasingly greater detail and formality in the planning process is required. DOJ components are encouraged to keep paperwork to a minimum and to put a premium on simplicity.
              (c) HCAs shall ensure that, during the acquisition planning phase, requirements personnel consider the use of:
              (1) The metric system of measurement consistent with 15 U.S.C. 2205(b); and
              (2) Environmentally preferable and energy-efficient products and services.
            
            
              2807.105
              Contents of written acquisition plans.
              (a) HCAs shall prescribe format and content of acquisition planning documents that are commensurate with the complexity and dollar value of the individual acquisition (sample acquisition planning documents for both simple and complex acquisitions will be make available by PPRG, JMD, and may be used or modified as appropriate).
              (b) HCAs shall include, at a minimum, the content elements at FAR 7.105 and 7.106 for all major systems acquisitions as defined in 2834.002.

              Policy.
              The requirements official shall provide the contracting officer, concurrent with the transmittal of the statement of work (or modification thereof), a written determination that none of the functions to be performed are inherently governmental. Any disputes concerning this determination shall be resolved by the contracting officer, after consultation with the requirements official. The contracting officer's determination shall be final.

              2809.402
              Policy.
              Contracting activities shall:
              (a) Consider debarment or suspension of a contractor when cause is shown as listed under FAR 9.406-2 and FAR 9.407-2. Contracting staffs should consult with their appropriate legal counsel prior to making a decision to initiate debarment or suspension proceedings. If a determination is made that available facts do not justify beginning debarment or suspension proceedings, the file should be documented accordingly. This determination should be subject to reconsideration if new information or additional fact-finding so justifies.
              (b) If the decision is made to initiate debarment and/or suspension of a contractor, immediately prepare a notice in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) of FAR 9.407-3(c). The draft notice, along with the administrative file containing all relevant facts and analysis shall be forwarded to the PE, as the debarring and suspending official, following review by the activity's legal counsel and BPC.
              (c) The PE shall:
              (1) Review the notice and administrative file for sufficiency and provide for review by other DOJ officials as considered appropriate;
              (2) If it is determined that action is warranted, give the contractor prompt notice of the proposed debarment or suspension, in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) or FAR 9.407-3(c);
              (3) Direct additional fact-finding as necessary when material facts are in dispute.
              (4) Notify the contractor of the final decision to debar or suspend, including a decision not to debar or suspend, in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and FAR 9.407-3(c).

              List of parties excluded from Federal procurement and nonprocurement programs.
              (a) The PE shall:

              (1) Provide GSA notification of the information set forth in FAR 9.404(b) within five working days after debarring or suspending a contractor or modifying or rescinding such an action.
              
              (2) Maintain agency-wide records of debarred or suspended contractors in accordance with FAR 9.404.
              (b) Contracting activities shall provide an effective system to ensure that contracting staff consult the “List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs” prior to soliciting offers from, awarding or extending contracts to, or consenting to subcontracts with contractors on the list.

              Effect of listing.
              (a) Contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment are excluded from receiving contracts, and bureaus shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors, unless the HCA determines that there is a compelling reason for such action and the PE approves such determinations.
              (b) Bids received from any listed contractor in response to an invitation for bids shall be entered on the abstract of bids, and rejected unless the HCA determines in writing that there is a compelling reason to consider the bid and the PE approves such action.
              (c) Proposals, quotations, or offers received from any listed contractor shall not be evaluated for award or included in the competitive range, nor shall discussions be conducted with a listed offeror during a period of ineligibility, unless the HCA determines in writing that there is a compelling reason to do so and the PE approves such action.
            
            
              2809.405-1
              Continuation of current contracts.
              (a) In accordance with FAR 9.405-1, contracting activities may continue contracts or subcontracts in existence at the time a contractor is suspended or debarred unless it is determined that termination of the contract is in the best interest of the Government. In making this determination, contracting activities shall consider the seriousness of the act or omission leading to the debarment or suspension, the effect of debarment or suspension on the contractor's ability to continue operations, and the Department's ability to safeguard its interests and receive satisfactory performance.
              (b) Contracting activities shall not renew or otherwise extend the duration of current contracts, or consent to subcontracts, with contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment, unless the HCA states, in writing, the compelling reasons for renewal or extension and the PE approves such action.

              Waiver.

              Dual systems means the use of both inch-pound and metric systems. For example, an item is designed, produced and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison purposes.
            
              Hybrid systems means the use of both inch-pound and standard metric values in specifications, standards, supplies, and services; e.g., an engine with internal parts in metric dimensions and external fittings or attachments in inch-pound dimensions.
            
              Metric system means the International System of Units established by the General Conference of Weights and Measures in 1960.
            
              Soft metric means the result of mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents in specifications, standards, supplies, and services. The physical dimensions are not changed.
          
          
            2811.002
            Policy.
            Consistent with the policy expressed in FAR 11.002(b), solicitations must include specifications and purchase descriptions stated in metric units of measurement whenever metric is the accepted industry system. Whenever possible, commercially developed metric specifications and internationally, or domestically developed voluntary standards, using metric measurements, must be adopted. While an industry is in transition to metric specifications, solicitations must include requirements documents stated in soft metric, hybrid, or dual systems, except when impractical or inefficient.

              The PE is the agency official delegated authority to exercise priority authority on behalf of the Department. Any request for a priority rating on a contract or order must be submitted to PPRG, JMD, in accordance with the procedures in this subpart.
              (a) The requesting activity shall submit, to the PE, a description of the supplies or services requiring a priority rating and a complete justification for the necessity of a rated order including the method and type of contract and the anticipated award date. The justification must also state the level of priority rating requested and comply with the requirements of the Defense Priorities and Allocations System.
              (b) Upon receipt, the PPRG shall review the request for completeness and establish appropriate liaison with the Department of Commerce (DOC), the administering agency. Depending on the nature of the requirement, the PPRG may schedule a meeting with DOC officials to present the proposal. In such cases, a representative from the requiring activity may be requested to attend.
              (c) DOJ activities requesting rated orders that concern classified material shall call PPRG before submitting their request to ensure appropriate transmission and handling between the requesting activity and PPRG.

              Policy.
              Under limited circumstances as described in this subpart, supplies or services directly related to mission accomplishment, may be acquired on the open market from local suppliers at the site of the work or use point, using vendor's invoices under the certified invoice procedure, instead of issuing purchase orders. Certified invoice procedures may not be used to place orders under established contracts.
            
            
              2813.7002
              Procedure.
              (a) Purchases utilizing the certified invoice procedure shall be effected only in accordance with FAR part 13 and this part 2813, subject to the following:
              (1) The amount of any one purchase does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold;
              (2) A purchase order is not required by either the supplier or the Government;
              (3) Appropriate invoices can be obtained from the supplier; and,
              (4) The items to be purchased shall be domestic source end products, except as provided in FAR subpart 25.1.
              (b) Use of the certified invoice procedures does not eliminate the requirements in FAR part 13 or this part 2813 that are applicable to purchases of this dollar threshold.
              (c) The chief of the contracting office, as defined in 2802.101(c), shall delegate the authority to use the certified invoice procedure. Each delegation must specify any limitations placed on the individual's use of these procedures, such as limits on the amount of each purchase, or limits on the commodities, or services which can be procured.

              (d) Each individual using this purchasing technique shall require the supplier to immediately submit properly prepared invoices which itemize property or services furnished. Upon receiving the invoice, the individual making the purchase shall annotate the invoice with the date of receipt, verify the arithmetic accuracy of the invoiced amount and verify on the invoice that the supplies and/or services have been received and accepted. If the invoice is correct, the individual making the purchase shall sign the invoice indicating acceptance and immediately forward it to the appropriate administrative office. The invoice shall be approved by the appropriate administrative office and forwarded to the Finance Office for payment within 5 workdays after receipt of the invoice, or acceptance of supplies or services, whichever is later. Before forwarding the invoice to Finance, the administrative office shall place the following statement on the invoice, along with the accounting and appropriation data:
              
              

                I certify that these goods and/or services were received on ________ (date) an accepted on ________ (date). Oral purchase was authorized and no confirming order has been issued.

              In cases where the contracting officer and the contractor cannot negotiate the definitization of a letter contract within 180 days after the date of the letter contract, or before completion of 40 percent of the work to be performed, the contracting officer may, with the written approval of the PE, revise and extend the definitization schedule. However, in no event shall the extension of the definitization schedule extend beyond the lesser of an additional 180 day period or the completion of 80 percent of the work to be performed. If at the end of the extension, the contracting officer and the contractor cannot negotiate a definitive contract because of failure to reach an agreement on price or fee, the procedures set forth in FAR 51.216-25, 16.603-2, 15.8, and part 31 shall be followed, as applicable.

              A letter contract may be used only after the express written approval of the Procurement Executive. Requests for approval shall contain the rationale explaining why no other contract is suitable and shall include the approval of the HCA or designee. Under circumstances of compelling urgency which do not permit the time needed for written approval, oral approval must be obtained; however, written documentation to support the award and confirm the oral approval must be submitted as soon as practicable after award.

              2823.403
              Policy.
              It is the policy of DOJ that its contracting activities and contractors that procure on behalf of DOJ, acquire EPA designated items in accordance with EPA's Comprehensive Procurement Guideline For Products Containing Recovered Materials (CPG) (40 CFR part 247). The recommended minimum recovered materials content of EPA designated items is set forth in EPA's Recovered Materials Advisory Notices (RMANs) and in E.O. 12873 as amended. These publications are available from the DOJEE.
            
            
              2823.404
              Procedures.
              (a) The program office initiating the acquisition is responsible for determining if recovered materials should be included in the specification. Procurement offices are responsible for informing program offices of the requirement for writing specifications for designated items that include minimum content standards specified in the RMANs.
              (b) If the program office chooses to procure designated items containing less than the minimum content standards, and program office must justify that decision in writing and include a copy of the signed justification with the procurement request package. FAR 23.404(b)(3) sets forth the only acceptable justifications for acquiring EPA designated items which do not meet the minimum content standard. The contracting officer is the approving official for justifications made pursuant to FAR 23.404(b)(3). Contracting officers are responsible for including a signed copy of the justification in the acquisition file and submitting a copy of the approved justification to the DOJEE.
            
            
              2823.404-70
              Affirmative procurement program for recycled materials.
              (a) Recovered materials preference program. Preference will be given to procuring and using products containing recovered materials rather than products made with virgin materials when adequate competition exists, and when price, performance and availability are equal.
              (b) Promotion program. The DOJEE has primary responsibility for actively promoting the acquisition of products containing recycled materials throughout DOJ. Technical and procurement personnel will cooperate with the DOJEE to actively promote DOJ's Affirmative Procurement Program (APP).
              (c) Procedures for vendor estimation, verification and certification—(1) Estimation. The contractor shall provide estimates of the total percentage(s) of recovered materials for EPA designated items to be used in products or services provided.
              (2) Certification. Contracting officers shall provide copies of all vendor and subcontractor certifications required by FAR 23.405(b) to the DOJEE.
              (3) Vertification. The DOJEE is responsible for periodically reviewing vendor certification documents and waivers as part of the annual review and monitoring process to determine if DOJ is in compliance with E.O. 12873 and subsequent amendments.

              2829.303
              Application of State and local taxes to Government contractors and subcontractors.
              (a) It is DOJ policy that DOJ contracts shall not contain clauses expressly designating prime contractors as agents of the Government for the purpose of avoiding State and local taxes.
              (b) Although circumstances may exist under which a contractor is an agent of the Government, even in the absence of a contract clause expressly designating a contractor as such, these circumstances should be extremely rare. Before any DOJ contracting activity may contend that any of its contractors are agents of the Government for the purpose of claiming immunity from State and local sales and use taxes, the matter will be referred to the AAG/A for review, and approval to ensure that DOJ policy is complied with and that the contracting activity's contention is fully in accordance with the pertinent legal principles and precedents. Each case forwarded will be reviewed by the HCA before referral to the AAG/A. The referral will include all pertinent data on which the contracting activity's contention is based, together with a thorough analysis of all relevant legal precedents.

              (c) Whenever clauses, procedures, and business practices are cited by DOJ contracting activities to support the contention that a contractor is an agent of the Government for the purpose of immunity from a State or local sales or use tax, contracting activities should whenever possible, devise alternative clauses, procedures, and practices for future use which will accomplish their intended purpose without providing the basis for contention that the contractor is an agent of the Government for the purpose of immunity from State and local sales or use taxes. Any referral to the AAG/A for approval under this subpart shall include comments on the extent to which alternative clauses, procedures, or practices may be utilized to accomplish the intended purpose without providing the basis for the contention that the contractor is an agent of the Government for the purpose of immunity from State and local sales or use taxes.

              (a) The DOJ and bureau contracting officers are encouraged to negotiate advance agreements concerning the treatment of special or unusual costs to avoid possible subsequent disputes or disallowance of costs based upon unreasonableness or nonallowability. All such agreements shall be negotiated in accordance with FAR 31.109 prior to the contractor incurring such costs. Contracting officers are not authorized to agree to a treatment of costs which would be inconsistent with FAR part 31.
              (b) Prior to negotiating an advance agreement, contracting officers shall make a written determination setting forth the reasons and rationale for entering into such agreements. In addition, the determination will set forth the nature, the duration, and which contract or contracts are covered by the proposed agreement. All determinations required by this subpart will be reviewed and approved at a level above the contracting officer prior to negotiation of the proposed agreement. The approved determination will be placed in the contract file.

              (c) All advance agreements shall be in writing and shall set forth the nature, duration, and contract or contracts covered by the agreements. Advance agreements will be signed by both the contractor and the contracting officer, and made a part of the contract file. Copies of executed advance agreements will be distributed to the cognizant audit office when applicable.
              (d) All advance agreements will be incorporated in full in the subsequent contract(s) to which they pertain, prior to award.

              (b) The following limitations apply to the execution of precontract cost authorizations.
              (1) Contracts which are estimated to be greater than the simplified acquisition threshold may contain a precontract cost authorization providing the authorization is for a period of 60 days or less and the dollar amount does not exceed the lesser of the simplified acquisition threshold or one third of the total estimated costs (including fee if any) of the contract.
              (2) the limitation expressed under paragraph (b) of this section may be increased in unusual circumstances as appropriate, with the written approval of the HCA, but in no event shall they exceed one-third of the total estimated costs (including fee if any) of the contract or be for periods of time which exceed 90 days.

              2833.101
              Definitions.
              (a) Agency Protest Official means the official, other than the contracting officer, designated to review and decide procurement protests filed with a contracting activity of the Department of Justice.
              (1) This person will be at a level above that of the Contracting Officer, will be knowledgeable about the acquisition process in general and will have no programmatic interest in the procurement.
              (2) This official shall be an individual designated by the head of the contracting activity and may be the Competition Advocate.
              (b) Deciding Official means the person chosen by the protestor to decide the agency protest; it may be either the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official.
              (c) Interested Party means an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.
            
            
              2833.102
              General.
              (a) This part describes policies and procedures for processing protests to the Department of Justice in accordance with Executive Order 12979, Agency Procurement Protests, dated October 25, 1995, and FAR 33.103. They are intended to be flexible and to provide for fair, quick, and inexpensive resolution of agency protests.
              (b) Interested parties have the option of protesting to the Contracting Officer or to the Agency Protest Official.
              (c) Contracting officers and potential protestors are encouraged to use their best efforts to resolve concerns through frank and open discussion, as required by FAR 33.103(b). In resolving concerns and/or protests, consideration should be given to the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques where appropriate.
              (d) Responsibilities:
              (1) Contracting Officers: (i) Include the provision at 2852.233-70 in all solicitations that are expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.
              (ii) If the protestor requests that the Contracting Officer decide the protest, or if the protest is silent on this issue, the Contracting Officer decides the protest using the procedures in this subpart and FAR 33.103.

              (iii) If the protestor requests that the Agency Protest Official decide the protest, the Contracting Officer must ensure that the Agency Protest Official receives a copy of the materials served on the Contracting Officer within one business day after the filing date.
              (2) Agency Protest Official: If the protestor requests that the Agency Protest Official decide the protest, the Official must use the procedures in this subpart and FAR 33.103 to provide an independent review of the issues raised in the protest.
            
            
              2833.103
              Protests to the agency.
              (a) The filing time frames in FAR 33.103(e) apply. An agency protest is filed when the protest complaint is received at the location the solicitation designates for serving protests.
              (b) An interested party filing an agency protest has the choice of requesting either that the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest.
              (c) In addition to the information required by FAR 33.103(d)(2), the protest must:
              (1) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.
              (2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.
              (3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide the protest.
              (4) Indicate whether the protestor prefers to make an oral or written presentation of arguments in support of the protest to the deciding official.
              (d) The decision by the Agency Protest Official is an alternative to a decision by the Contracting Officer on a protest. The Agency Protest Official will not consider appeals from a Contracting Officer's decision on an agency protest.
              (e) The deciding official must conduct a scheduling conference with the protestor within five (5) days after the protest is filed. The scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written arguments in support of the agency protest and for agency officials to present information in response to the protest issues. The deciding official may hear oral arguments in support of the agency protest at the same time as the scheduling conference, depending on availability of the necessary parties.
              (f) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in person. Other parties may attend at the discretion of the deciding official.
              (g) The protestor has only one opportunity to support or explain the substance of its protest. Department of Justice procedures do not provide for any discovery. The deciding official has discretion to request additional information from either the agency or the protestor. However, the deciding official will normally decide protests on the basis of information provided by the protestor and the agency.
              (h) The preferred practice is to resolve protests through informal oral discussion.
              (i) An interested party may represent itself or be represented by legal counsel. The Department of Justice will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.
              (j) If an agency protest is received before contract award, the Contracting Officer must not make award unless the Head of the Contracting Activity makes a determination to proceed under FAR 33.103(f)(1). Similarly, if an agency protest is filed within ten (10) days after award, the Contracting Officer must stay performance unless the Head of the Contracting Activity makes a determination to proceed under FAR 33.103(f)(3). Any stay of award or suspension of performance remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.
              (k) The deciding official must make a best effort to issue a decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date. The decision may be oral or written. If oral, the deciding official must send a confirming letter within three (3) days after the decision using a means that provides receipt. The confirming letter must include the following information:
              (1) State whether the protest was denied, sustained or dismissed.
              (2) Indicate the date the decision was provided.
              (l) If the deciding official sustains the protest, relief may consist of any of the following:
              (1) Recommendation that the contract be terminated for convenience or cause.
              (2) Recompeting the requirement.
              
              (3) Amending the solicitation.
              (4) Refraining from exercising contract options.
              (5) Awarding a contract consistent with statute, regulation, and the terms of the solicitation.
              (6) Other action that the deciding official determines is appropriate.
              (m) If the Agency Protest Official sustains a protest, then within 30 days after receiving the Official's recommendations for relief, the Contracting Officer must either:
              (1) Fully implement the recommended relief; or
              (2) Notify the Agency Protest Official in writing of any recommendations have not been implemented and explain why.
              (n) Proceedings on an agency protest may be dismissed or stayed if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum outside of the Department of Justice.

              Policy.
              In accordance with Pub. L. 98-577, the Small Business and Federal Procurement Competition Enhancement Act of 1984, an executive agency may establish a dollar threshold for the designation of a major system. Accordingly, dollar thresholds for a major system under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-109 are designated in this section.
              (a) Major automated information system. Within the Department of Justice, a major automated information system is one whose life-cycle cost is in excess of $100 million.
              (b) Major real property system. (1) By purchase, when the assessed value of the property exceeds $60 million.
              (2) By lease, when the annual rental charges, including basic services (e.g., cleaning, guards, maintenance), exceed $1.8 million.
              (3) By transfer from another agency at no cost when the assessed value of the property exceeds $12 million.
              (c) Research and Development (R&D) System. Any R&D activity expected to exceed $0.5 million, for the R&D phase is subject to OMB Circular A-109, unless exempted by the HCA.
              (d) Any other system or activity. The HCA responsible for the system may designate any system or activity as a Major System under OMB Circular A-109 as a result of Departmental review, e.g., selected systems designed to support more than one principal organizational unit.
              (e) Exemption. The AAG/A, upon recommendation by the HCA responsible for the system, may determine that because of the routine nature of the acquisition, the system (e.g., an information system utilizing only off-the-shelf hardware or software) will be exempt from the OMB Circular A-109 process, although by virtue of the life cycle costs, it would otherwise be identified as “major” in response to OMB Circular A-109.

              Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).
              As prescribed in subpart 2801.70, insert the following clause:
              
                Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) (JAN 1985)
                (a) Mr./Ms (Name) of (Organization) (Room No.), (Building), (Address), (Area Code & Telephone No.), is hereby designated to act as Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) under this contract.
                (b) The COTR is responsible, as applicable, for: receiving all deliverable, inspecting and accepting the supplies or services provided hereunder in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract; providing direction to the contractor which clarifies the contract effort, fills in details or otherwise serves to accomplish the contractual Scope of Work; evaluating performance; and certifying all invoices/vouchers for acceptance of the supplies or services furnished for payment.
                (c) The COTR does not have the authority to alter the contractor's obligations under the contract, and/or modify any of the expressed terms, conditions, specifications, or cost of the agreement. If as a result of technical discussions it is desirable to alter/change contractual obligations or the Scope of Work, the Contracting Officer shall issue such changes.

              Brand-name or equal.
              As prescribed in 2811.104-70, insert the following clause:
              
                Brand-Name or Equal (JAN 1985)
                (a) The terms “bid” and “bidders”, as used in this clause, include the terms “proposal” and “offerors”. The terms “invitation for bids” and “invitational”, as used in their clause include the terms “request for proposal” and “request”.
                (b) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a “brand name or equal” description, such identification is intended to be descriptive but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering “equal” products (including products of a brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics and requirements listed in the invitation.
                (c) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in his/her bid that he/she is offering an “equal” product, his/her bid shall be considered as offering the brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.

                (d)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an “equal” product, the branch name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determinations to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. To ensure the sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all description material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to: (i) determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirements of the invitation for bids, and (ii) established exactly what the bidder proposed to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
                (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the invitation for bids, he/she shall: (i) include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modification, and (ii) clearly mark any description material to show the proposed modifications.
                (3) Modifications proposed after the bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids will not be considered.

              Unsafe conditions due to the presence of hazardous material.
              As prescribed in 2823.303-70, insert the following clause:
              
                Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material (JUN 1996)
                (a) “Unsafe condition” as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.
                (b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to appraise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.
                (c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.
                (d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.
                (e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
                (f) Notice contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.
              
              (End of clause)
            
            
              2852.233-70
              Protests filed directly with the Department of Justice.
              As prescribed in 2833.102(d), insert a clause substantially as follows:
              
                Protests Filed Directly With the Department of Justice (JAN 1998)
                (a) The following definitions apply in this provision:
                (1) “Agency Protest Official” means the official, other than the contracting officer, designated to review and decide procurement protests filed with a contracting activity of the Department of Justice.
                (2) “Deciding Official” means the person chosen by the protestor to decide the agency protest; it may be either the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official.
                (3) “Interested Party” means an actual or prospective offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.
                (b) A protest filed directly with the Department of Justice must:
                (1) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.
                (2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.

                (3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protestor is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide the protest.
                
                (4) Indicate whether the protestor prefers to make an oral or written presentation of arguments in support of the protest to the deciding official.
                (5) Include the information required by FAR 33.103(a)(2):
                (i) Name, address, facsimile number and telephone number of the protestor.
                (ii) Solicitation or contract number.
                (iii) Detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, to include a description of resulting prejudice to the protestor.
                (iv) Copies of relevant documents.
                (v) Request for a ruling by the agency.
                (vi) Statement as to the form of relief requested.
                (vii) All information establishing that the protestor is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest.
                (viii) All information establishing the timeliness of this protest.
                (c) An interested party filing a protest with the Department of Justice has the choice of requesting either that the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest.
                (d) The decision by the Agency Protest Official is an alternative to a decision by the Contracting Officer. The Agency Protest Official will not consider appeals from the Contracting Officer's decision on an agency protest.
                (e) The deciding official must conduct a scheduling conference with the protestor within five (5) days after the protest is filed. The scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written arguments in support of the agency protest and for many officials to present information in response to the protest issues. The deciding official may hear oral arguments in support of the agency protest at the same time as the scheduling conference, depending on availability of the necessary parties.
                (f) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in person. Other parties may attend at the discretion of the deciding official.
                (g) The protestor has only one opportunity to support or explain the substance of its protest. Department of Justice procedures do not provide for any discovery. The deciding official may request additional information from either the agency or the protestor. The deciding official will resolve the protest through informal presentations or meetings to the maximum extent practicable.
                (h) An interested party may rerpresent itself or be represented by legal counsel. The Department of Justice will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.
                (i) The Department of Justice will stay award or suspend contract Performance in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). The stay or suspension unless over-ridden, remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.
                (j) The deciding official will make a best effort to issue a decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date. The decision may be oral or written.
                (k) The Department of Justice may dismiss or stay proceeding on an agency protest if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum outside the Department of Justice.
