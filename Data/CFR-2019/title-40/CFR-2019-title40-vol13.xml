      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

                <P>(i) If a DRE test performed pursuant to § 63.1207(c)(2) is acceptable as documentation of compliance with the DRE standard, you may use the highest hourly rolling average hydrocarbon level achieved during the DRE test runs to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard. An acceptable DRE test is any test for which the data and results are determined to meet quality assurance objectives (on a site-specific basis) such that the results adequately demonstrate compliance with the DRE standard.</P>
                <P>(ii) If during this acceptable DRE test you did not obtain hydrocarbon emissions data sufficient to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard, you must either:</P>
                <P>(A) Perform, as part of the performance test, an “equivalent DRE test” to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard. An equivalent DRE test is comprised of a minimum of three runs each with a minimum duration of one hour during which you operate the combustor as close as reasonably possible to the operating parameter limits that you established based on the initial DRE test. You must use the highest hourly rolling average hydrocarbon emission level achieved during the equivalent DRE test to document compliance with the hydrocarbon standard; or</P>
                <P>(B) Perform a DRE test as part of the performance test.</P>

                <P>(B) You may use any DRE test data that documents that your source achieves the required level of DRE provided:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) You have not modified the design or operation of your source in a manner that could effect the ability of your source to achieve the DRE standard since the DRE test was performed; and,</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The DRE test data meet quality assurance objectives determined on a site-specific basis.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sources that feed hazardous waste at locations other than the normal flame zone.</E> (A) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section, if you feed hazardous waste at a location in the combustion system other than the <PRTPAGE P="24"/>normal flame zone, then you must demonstrate compliance with the DRE standard during each comprehensive performance test;</P>
                <P>(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) A cement kiln that feeds hazardous waste at a location other than the normal flame zone need only demonstrate compliance with the DRE standard during three consecutive comprehensive performance tests provided that:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) All three tests achieve the DRE standard in this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The design, operation, and maintenance features of each of the three tests are similar;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The data in lieu restriction of § 63.1207(c)(2)(iv) does not apply when complying with the provisions of paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If at any time you change your design, operation, and maintenance features in a manner that could reasonably be expected to affect your ability to meet the DRE standard, then you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) For sources that do not use DRE previous testing to document conformance with the DRE standard pursuant to § 63.1207(c)(2), you must perform DRE testing during the initial comprehensive performance test.</P>

Neither your submittal of the plan, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the plan, relieves you of the responsibility to comply with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Changes to the plan that may significantly increase emissions.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) You must request approval in writing from the Administrator within 5 days after making a change to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan that may significantly increase emissions of hazardous air pollutants.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) To request approval of such changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, you must follow the procedures provided by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section for initial approval of the plan.</P>

If you exceed a part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter emission standard monitored by a CEMS or COMs or operating limit specified under § 63.1209, the automatic waste feed cutoff system must immediately and automatically cutoff the hazardous waste feed, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section. If the malfunction itself prevents immediate and automatic cutoff of the hazardous waste feed, however, you must cease feeding hazardous waste as quickly as possible.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Although the automatic waste feed cutoff requirements continue to apply during a malfunction, an exceedance of an emission standard monitored by a CEMS or COMS or operating limit specified under § 63.1209 is not a violation of this subpart if you take the corrective measures prescribed in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Excessive exceedances during malfunctions.</E> For each set of 10 exceedances of an emission standard or operating requirement while hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., when the hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous waste feed was cutoff) during a 60-day block period, you must:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Within 45 days of the 10th exceedance, complete an investigation of the cause of each exceedance and evaluation of approaches to minimize the frequency, duration, and severity of each exceedance, and revise the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan as warranted by the evaluation to minimize the frequency, duration, and severity of each exceedance; and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Record the results of the investigation and evaluation in the operating record, and include a summary of the investigation and evaluation, and any changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, in the excess emissions report required under § 63.10(e)(3).</P>

                </P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Although the automatic waste feed cutoff requirements of this paragraph apply during startup and shutdown, an exceedance of an emission standard or operating limit is not a violation of this subpart if you comply with the operating procedures prescribed in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Automatic waste feed cutoff (AWFCO)</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> Upon the compliance date, you must operate the hazardous waste combustor with a functioning system that immediately and automatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii) of this section:</P>
                <P>(A) When any of the following are exceeded: Operating parameter limits specified under § 63.1209; an emission standard monitored by a CEMS; and the allowable combustion chamber pressure;</P>
                <P>(B) When the span value of any CMS detector, except a CEMS, is met or exceeded;</P>
                <P>(C) Upon malfunction of a CMS monitoring an operating parameter limit specified under § 63.1209 or an emission level; or</P>
                <P>(D) When any component of the automatic waste feed cutoff system fails.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Ducting of combustion gases.</E> During an AWFCO, you must continue to duct combustion gasses to the air pollution control system while hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., if the hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Restarting waste feed.</E> You must continue to monitor during the cutoff the operating parameters for which limits are established under § 63.1209 and the emissions required under that section to be monitored by a CEMS, and you must not restart the hazardous waste feed until the operating parameters and emission levels are within the specified limits.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Failure of the AWFCO system.</E> If the AWFCO system fails to automatically and immediately cutoff the flow of hazardous waste upon exceedance of a parameter required to be interlocked with the AWFCO system under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, you have failed to comply with the AWFCO requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If an equipment or other failure prevents immediate and automatic cutoff of the hazardous waste feed, however, you must cease feeding hazardous waste as quickly as possible.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Corrective measures.</E> If, after any AWFCO, there is an exceedance of an emission standard or operating requirement, irrespective of whether the exceedance occurred while hazardous waste remained in the combustion chamber (i.e., whether the hazardous waste residence time has transpired since the hazardous waste feed cutoff system was activated), you must investigate the cause of the AWFCO, take appropriate corrective measures to minimize future AWFCOs, and record the findings and corrective measures in the operating record.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Excessive exceedance reporting.</E> (A) For each set of 10 exceedances of an emission standard or operating requirement while hazardous waste remains in the combustion chamber (i.e., when the hazardous waste residence time has not transpired since the hazardous waste feed was cutoff) during a 60-day block period, you must submit to the Administrator a written report within 5 calendar days of the 10th exceedance documenting the exceedances and results of the investigation and corrective measures taken.</P>
                <P>(B) On a case-by-case basis, the Administrator may require excessive exceedance reporting when fewer than 10 exceedances occur during a 60-day block period.</P>
                <P>(vii) <E T="03">Testing.</E> The AWFCO system and associated alarms must be tested at least weekly to verify operability, unless you document in the operating record that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent inspection will be adequate. At a minimum, you must conduct operability testing at least monthly. You must document and record in the operating record AWFCO operability test procedures and results.</P>
                <P>(viii) <E T="03">Ramping down waste feed.</E> (A) You may ramp down the waste feedrate of pumpable hazardous waste over a period not to exceed one minute, except as provided by paragraph (c)(3)(viii)(B) of this section. If you elect to ramp <PRTPAGE P="33"/>down the waste feed, you must document ramp down procedures in the operating and maintenance plan. The procedures must specify that the ramp down begins immediately upon initiation of automatic waste feed cutoff and the procedures must prescribe a bona fide ramping down. If an emission standard or operating limit is exceeded during the ramp down, you have failed to comply with the emission standards or operating requirements of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(B) If the automatic waste feed cutoff is triggered by an exceedance of any of the following operating limits, you may not ramp down the waste feed cutoff: Minimum combustion chamber temperature, maximum hazardous waste feedrate, or any hazardous waste firing system operating limits that may be established for your combustor.</P>

                <P>(ii) <E T="03">ESV operating plan.</E> (A) You must develop an ESV operating plan, comply with the operating plan, and keep the plan in the operating record.</P>
                <P>(B) The ESV operating plan must provide detailed procedures for rapidly stopping the waste feed, shutting down the combustor, and maintaining temperature and negative pressure in the combustion chamber during the hazardous waste residence time, if feasible. The plan must include calculations and information and data documenting the effectiveness of the plan's procedures for ensuring that combustion chamber temperature and negative pressure are maintained as is reasonably feasible.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Corrective measures.</E> After any ESV opening that results in a failure to meet the emission standards as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, you must investigate the cause of the ESV opening, take appropriate corrective measures to minimize such future ESV openings, and record the findings and corrective measures in the operating record.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Reporting requirements.</E> You must submit to the Administrator a written report within 5 days of an ESV opening that results in failure to meet the emission standards of this subpart (as determined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) documenting the result of the investigation and corrective measures taken.</P>

Your recommended quality assurance procedures may include periodic testing under as-found conditions (i.e., normal operations) to obtain additional PM concentration and PMDS response run pairs, as warranted.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Set-points established with extrapolation.</E> If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that will reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the value that correlates to the alarm set-point.</P>
                <P>(E) You must include procedures for installation, operation, maintenance, and quality assurance of the PMDS in the site-specific continuous monitoring system test plan required under §§ 63.1207(e) and 63.8(e)(3);</P>
                <P>(F) Where multiple detectors are required to monitor multiple control devices, the system's instrumentation and alarm system may be shared among the detectors.</P>
                <P>(G) You must establish the alarm set-point as a 6-hour rolling average as provided by paragraphs (c)(9)(ii), (c)(9)(iii), and (c)(9)(iv) of this section;</P>
                <P>(H) Your PMDS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. You must update the 6-hour rolling average of the detector response each hour with a one-hour block average that is the average of the detector responses over each 15-minute block; and</P>
                <P>(I) If you exceed the alarm set-point (or if your PMDS malfunctions), you must comply with the corrective measures under paragraph (c)(9)(vii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Establishing the alarm set-point for operations under the Documentation of Compliance.</E> You must establish the alarm set-point for operations under the Documentation of Compliance (i.e., after the compliance date but prior to submitting a Notification of Compliance subsequent to conducting the initial comprehensive performance test) of an existing source as follows:</P>

                <P>(A) You must obtain a minimum of three pairs of Method 5 or 5I data, provided in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter, and PMDS data to establish an approximate correlation curve. Data obtained up to 60 months prior to the compliance date may be used provided that the design and operation of the combustor or PMDS has not changed in a manner that may adversely affect the correlation of PM concentrations and PMDS response.<PRTPAGE P="38"/>
                </P>
                <P>(B) You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of your determination whether multiple correlation curves are needed considering the design and operation of your combustor and PMDS.</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) You may assume a linear correlation of the PMDS response to particulate matter emission concentrations;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) You may include a zero point correlation value. To establish a zero point, you must follow one or more of the following steps:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained, to the extent possible, by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Zero point data also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas); and</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) If none of the steps in paragraphs (c)(9)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>) through (<E T="03">iii</E>) of this section are possible, you must estimate the monitor response when no PM is in the flue gas (e.g., 4 mA = 0 mg/acm).</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For reference method data that were obtained from runs during a test condition where controllable operating factors were held constant, you must average the test run averages of PM concentrations and PMDS responses to obtain a single pair of data for PM concentration and PMDS response. You may use this pair of data and the zero point to define a linear correlation model for the PMDS.</P>
                <P>(D) You must establish the alarm set-point as the PMDS response that corresponds to a PM concentration that is 50% of the PM emission standard or 125% of the highest PM concentration used to develop the correlation, whichever is greater. For reference method data that were obtained from runs during a test condition where controllable operating factors were held constant, you must use the average of the test run averages of PM concentrations for extrapolating the alarm set-point. The PM emission concentration used to extrapolate the alarm set-point must not exceed the PM emission standard, however.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Establishing the initial alarm set-point for operations under the Notification of Compliance.</E> You must establish the initial alarm set-point for operations under the Notification of Compliance as provided by either paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) or paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section. You must periodically revise the alarm set-point as provided by paragraph (c)(9)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Establishing the initial set-point without extrapolation.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) If you establish the initial alarm set-point without extrapolation, the alarm set-point is the average of the test run averages of the PMDS response during the runs of the comprehensive performance test that document compliance with the PM emission standard.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) During the comprehensive performance test, you may simulate PM emission concentrations at the upper end of the range of normal operations by means including feeding high levels of ash and detuning the emission control equipment.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Establishing the initial set-point by extrapolation.</E> You may extrapolate the particulate matter detector response to establish the alarm set-point under the following procedures:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the procedures you will use to establish an approximate correlation curve using the three pairs of Method 5 or 5I data (see methods in appendix A-3 of part 60 of this chapter) and PMDS data from the comprehensive performance test, the data pairs used to establish the correlation curve for the Documentation of Compliance under paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section, and additional data pairs, as warranted.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) You must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, <PRTPAGE P="39"/>of your determination of whether multiple correlation curves are needed considering the design and operation of your combustor and PMDS. If so, you must recommend the number of data pairs needed to establish those correlation curves and how the data will be obtained.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) During the comprehensive performance test, you may simulate PM emission concentrations at the upper end of the range of normal operations by means including feeding high levels of ash and detuning the emission control equipment.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Data obtained up to 60 months prior to the comprehensive performance test may be used provided that the design and operation of the combustor or PMDS has not changed in a manner that may adversely affect the correlation of PM concentrations and PMDS response.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) You may include a zero point correlation value. To establish a zero point, you must follow the procedures under paragraph (c)(9)(ii)(C)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) You must use a least-squares regression model to correlate PM concentrations to PMDS responses for data pairs. You may assume a linear regression model approximates the relationship between PM concentrations and PMDS responses.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) You must establish the alarm set-point as the PMDS response that corresponds to a PM concentration that is 50% of the PM emission standard or 125% of the highest PM concentration used to develop the correlation, whichever is greater. The emission concentration used to extrapolate the PMDS response must not exceed the PM emission standard.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Revising the Notification of Compliance alarm set-point</E>—(A) <E T="03">Revising set-points established without extrapolation.</E> If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must establish a new alarm set-point in the Notification of Compliance following each comprehensive performance test as the average of the test run averages of the PMDS response during the runs of the comprehensive performance test that document compliance with the PM emission standard.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Revising set-points established with extrapolation.</E> If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the procedures for periodically revising the alarm set-point, considering the additional data pairs obtained during periodic comprehensive performance tests and data pairs obtained from other tests, such as for quality assurance.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Quality assurance</E>—(A) <E T="03">Set-points established without extrapolation.</E> If you establish the alarm set-point without extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the average of the PM concentrations demonstrated during the comprehensive performance test. Your recommended quality assurance procedures may include periodic testing under as-found conditions (i.e., normal operations) to obtain additional PM concentration and PMDS response run pairs, as warranted.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Set-points established with extrapolation.</E> If you establish the alarm set-point by extrapolation under paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(B) of this section, you must request approval from the regulatory authority, in the continuous monitoring system test plan, of the quality assurance procedures that reasonably ensure that PMDS response values below the alarm set-point correspond to PM emission concentrations below the value that correlated to the alarm set-point.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">PMDS are used for compliance assurance only.</E> For a PMDS for which the alarm set-point is established by extrapolation using a correlation curve under paragraphs (c)(9)(ii), (c)(9)(iii)(B), and (c)(9)(iv)(B) of this section, an exceedance of the PMDS response that appears to correlate with a PM concentration that exceeds the PM emission standard is not by itself evidence that the standard has been exceeded.<PRTPAGE P="40"/>
                </P>
                <P>(vii) <E T="03">PMDS corrective measures requirements.</E> The operating and maintenance plan required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section must include a corrective measures plan that specifies the procedures you will follow in the case of a PMDS alarm or malfunction. The corrective measures plan must include, at a minimum, the procedures used to determine and record the time and cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction as well as the corrective measures taken to correct the control device or PMDS malfunction or minimize emissions as specified below. Failure to initiate the corrective measures required by this paragraph is failure to ensure compliance with the emission standards in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(A) You must initiate the procedures used to determine the cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction within 30 minutes of the time the alarm first sounds or the PMDS malfunctions; and</P>
                <P>(B) You must alleviate the cause of the alarm or the PMDS malfunction by taking the necessary corrective measure(s) which may include shutting down the combustor.</P>
                <P>(viii) <E T="03">Excessive exceedances notification.</E> If you operate the combustor when the detector response exceeds the alarm set-point or when the PMDS is malfunctioning more than 5 percent of the time during any 6-month block time period, you must submit a notification to the Administrator within 30 days of the end of the 6-month block time period that describes the causes of the exceedances and the revisions to the design, operation, or maintenance of the combustor, emission control device, or PMDS you are taking to minimize exceedances. To document compliance with this requirement:</P>
                <P>(A) You must keep records of the date, time, and duration of each alarm and PMDS malfunction, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and a brief description of the cause of the alarm or PMDS malfunction and the corrective action taken;</P>
                <P>(B) You must record the percent of the operating time during each 6-month period that the alarm sounds and the PMDS malfunctions;</P>
                <P>(C) If inspection of the emission control device demonstrates that no corrective action is required, then no alarm time is counted; and</P>
                <P>(D) If corrective action to the emission control device is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. Each PMDS malfunction shall also be counted as a minimum of 1 hour.</P>

If you submit data in lieu of the initial performance test, you must commence the initial confirmatory performance test within 31 months of the date six months after the compliance date. To ensure that the confirmatory test is conducted approximately midway between comprehensive performance tests, the Administrator will not approve a test plan that schedules testing within 18 months of commencing the previous comprehensive performance test.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Duration of testing.</E> You must complete performance testing within 60 days after the date of commencement, unless the Administrator determines that a time extension is warranted based on your documentation in writing of factors beyond your control that prevent you from meeting the 60-day deadline.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Applicable testing requirements under the interim standards</E>—(i) <E T="03">Waiver of periodic comprehensive performance tests.</E> Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must conduct only an initial comprehensive performance test under the interim standards (§§ 63.1203 through 63.1205); all subsequent comprehensive performance testing requirements are waived under the interim standards.

The Administrator will notify you of approval or intent to deny approval of the site-specific test plan and CMS performance evaluation test plan within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original test plans.</P>
                <P>(2) You must make your site-specific test plan and CMS performance evaluation test plan available to the public for review no later than 60 calendar days before initiation of the test. You must issue a public notice to all persons on your facility/public mailing list (developed pursuant to 40 CFR 70.7(h), 71.11(d)(3)(i)(E) and 124.10(c)(1)(ix)) announcing the availability of the test plans and the location where the test plans are available for review. The test plans must be accessible to the public for 60 calendar days, beginning on the date that you issue your public notice.

                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Modes of operation.</E> Given that you must establish limits for the applicable operating parameters specified in § 63.1209 based on operations during the comprehensive performance test, you may conduct testing under two or more operating modes to provide operating flexibility.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Steady-state conditions.</E> (A) Prior to obtaining performance test data, you must operate under performance test conditions until you reach steady-state operations with respect to emissions of pollutants you must measure during the performance test and operating parameters under § 63.1209 for which you must establish limits. During system conditioning, you must ensure that each operating parameter for which you must establish a limit is held at the level planned for the performance test. You must include documentation in the performance test plan under paragraph (f) of this section justifying the duration of system conditioning.</P>

                <P>(B) If you own or operate a hazardous waste cement kiln that recycles collected particulate matter (i.e., cement kiln dust) into the kiln, you must sample and analyze the recycled particulate matter prior to obtaining performance test data for levels of selected metals that must be measured during performance testing to document that the system has reached steady-state conditions (i.e., that metals levels have stabilized). You must document the rationale for selecting metals that are indicative of system equilibrium and include the information in the performance test plan under paragraph (f) of this section. To determine system equilibrium, you must sample and analyze the recycled particulate matter hourly <PRTPAGE P="48"/>for each selected metal, unless you submit in the performance test plan a justification for reduced sampling and analysis and the Administrator approves in writing a reduced sampling and analysis frequency.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Confirmatory performance testing.</E> You must conduct confirmatory performance testing for dioxin/furan under normal operating conditions for the following parameters:</P>
                <P>(i) Carbon monoxide (or hydrocarbon) CEMS emissions levels must be within the range of the average value to the maximum value allowed, except as provided by paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section. The average value is defined as the sum of the hourly rolling average values recorded (each minute) over the previous 12 months, divided by the number of rolling averages recorded during that time. The average value must not include calibration data, startup data, shutdown data, malfunction data, and data obtained when not burning hazardous waste;</P>
                <P>(ii) Each operating limit (specified in § 63.1209) established to maintain compliance with the dioxin/furan emission standard must be held within the range of the average value over the previous 12 months and the maximum or minimum, as appropriate, that is allowed, except as provided by paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section. The average value is defined as the sum of the rolling average values recorded over the previous 12 months, divided by the number of rolling averages recorded during that time. The average value must not include calibration data, startup data, shutdown data, malfunction data, and data obtained when not burning hazardous waste;</P>

In addition, when making the finding of compliance, the Administrator may consider test conditions outside of the range specified in the test plan based on a finding that you could not reasonably maintain the range specified in the test plan and considering factors including whether the time duration and level of the parameter when operations were out of the specified range were such that operations during the confirmatory test are determined to be reasonably representative of normal operations. In addition, the Administrator will consider the proximity of the emission test results to the standard.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Operating conditions during subsequent testing.</E> (1) Current operating parameter limits established under § 63.1209 are waived during subsequent comprehensive performance testing.</P>
                <P>(2) Current operating parameter limits are also waived during pretesting prior to comprehensive performance testing for an aggregate time not to exceed 720 hours of operation (renewable at the discretion of the Administrator) under an approved test plan or if the source records the results of the pretesting. Pretesting means:</P>
                <P>(i) Operations when stack emissions testing for dioxin/furan, mercury, semivolatile metals, low volatile metals, particulate matter, or hydrogen chloride/chlorine gas is being performed; and</P>

                <P>(i) <E T="03">Time extension for subsequent performance tests.</E> After the initial comprehensive performance test, you may request up to a one-year time extension for conducting a comprehensive or confirmatory performance test to consolidate performance testing with other state or federally required emission testing, or for other reasons deemed acceptable by the Administrator. If the Administrator grants a time extension for a comprehensive performance test, the deadlines for commencing the next comprehensive and confirmatory tests are based on the date that the subject comprehensive performance test commences.</P>

                <P>(1) You must submit in writing to the Administrator any request under this <PRTPAGE P="49"/>paragraph for a time extension for conducting a performance test.</P>

                <P>(ii) The date by which you will commence performance testing.</P>
                <P>(3) The Administrator will notify you in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of your request for an extension for conducting a performance test within 30 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate your request.

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Documentation of compliance.</E> (1) By the compliance date, you must develop and include in the operating record a Documentation of Compliance. You are not subject to this requirement, however, if you submit a Notification of Compliance under § 63.1207(j) prior to the compliance date. Upon inclusion of the Documentation of Compliance in the operating record, hazardous waste burning incinerators, cement kilns, and lightweight aggregate kilns regulated under the interim standards of §§ 63.1203, 63.1204, and 63.1205 are no longer subject to compliance with the previously applicable Notification of Compliance.</P>
                <P>(2) The Documentation of Compliance must identify the applicable emission standards under this subpart and the limits on the operating parameters under § 63.1209 that will ensure compliance with those emission standards.</P>

                <P>(3) You must include a signed and dated certification in the Documentation of Compliance that:<PRTPAGE P="76"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) Required CEMs and CMS are installed, calibrated, and continuously operating in compliance with the requirements of this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Based on an engineering evaluation prepared under your direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to ensure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information and supporting documentation, and considering at a minimum the design, operation, and maintenance characteristics of the combustor and emissions control equipment, the types, quantities, and characteristics of feedstreams, and available emissions data:</P>
                <P>(A) You are in compliance with the emission standards of this subpart; and</P>
                <P>(B) The limits on the operating parameters under § 63.1209 ensure compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(4) You must comply with the emission standards and operating parameter limits specified in the Documentation of Compliance.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Data compression.</E> You may submit a written request to the Administrator for approval to use data compression techniques to record data from CMS, including CEMS, on a frequency less than that required by § 63.1209. You must submit the request for review and approval as part of the comprehensive performance test plan.</P>
                <P>(1) You must record a data value at least once each ten minutes.</P>
                <P>(2) For each CEMS or operating parameter for which you request to use data compression techniques, you must recommend:</P>
                <P>(i) A fluctuation limit that defines the maximum permissible deviation of a new data value from a previously generated value without requiring you to revert to recording each one-minute value.</P>
                <P>(A) If you exceed a fluctuation limit, you must record each one-minute value for a period of time not less than ten minutes.</P>
                <P>(B) If neither the fluctuation limit nor the data compression limit are exceeded during that period of time, you may reinitiate recording data values on a frequency of at least once each ten minutes; and</P>
                <P>(ii) A data compression limit defined as the closest level to an operating parameter limit or emission standard at which reduced data recording is allowed.</P>
                <P>(A) Within this level and the operating parameter limit or emission standard, you must record each one-minute average.</P>
                <P>(B) The data compression limit should reflect a level at which you are unlikely to exceed the specific operating parameter limit or emission standard, considering its averaging period, with the addition of a new one-minute average.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Subpart EEE of Part 63—Quality Assurance Procedures for Continuous Emissions Monitors Used for Hazardous Waste Combustors</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Applicability and Principle</HD>
              <P>1.1 Applicability. These quality assurance requirements are used to evaluate the effectiveness of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) procedures and the quality of data produced by continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) that are used for determining compliance with the emission standards on a continuous basis as specified in the applicable regulation. The QA procedures specified by these requirements represent the minimum requirements necessary for the control and assessment of the quality of CEMS data used to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards provided under this subpart EEE of part 63. Owners and operators must meet these minimum requirements and are encouraged to develop and implement a more extensive QA program. These requirements supersede those found in part 60, Appendix F, of this chapter. Appendix F does not apply to hazardous waste-burning devices.</P>
              <P>1.2 Principle. The QA procedures consist of two distinct and equally important functions. One function is the assessment of the quality of the CEMS data by estimating accuracy. The other function is the control and improvement of the quality of the CEMS data by implementing QC policies and corrective actions. These two functions form a control loop. When the assessment function indicates that the data quality is inadequate, the source must immediately stop burning hazardous waste. The CEM data control effort must be increased until the data quality is acceptable before hazardous waste burning can resume.</P>
              <P>a. In order to provide uniformity in the assessment and reporting of data quality, this procedure explicitly specifies the assessment methods for response drift and accuracy. The methods are based on procedures included in the applicable performance specifications provided in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. These procedures also require the analysis of the EPA audit samples concurrent with certain reference method (RM) analyses as specified in the applicable RM's.</P>
              <P>b. Because the control and corrective action function encompasses a variety of policies, specifications, standards, and corrective measures, this procedure treats QC requirements in general terms to allow each source owner or operator to develop a QC system that is most effective and efficient for the circumstances.</P>

              <P>(1) If a storage tank is dedicated to a single PMPU, the storage tank shall belong to that PMPU.</P>
              <P>(2) If a storage tank is shared among process units (including at least one PMPU), then the storage tank shall belong to the process unit located on the same plant site as the storage tank that has the greatest annual volume input into or output from the storage tank (i.e., said PMPU or process unit has the predominant use of the storage tank).</P>
              <P>(3) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage tank that is shared among process units (including at least one PMPU), then the owner or operator shall assign the storage tank to any one of the PMPU's that shares it and is also subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) If the predominant use of a storage tank varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding September 21, 1998 for existing affected sources. For new affected sources, predominant use will be based on the first year after initial startup. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.1260(f). If the predominant use changes, the redetermination of predominant use shall be reported in the next Periodic report.</P>
              <P>(5) If the storage tank begins receiving material from (or sending material to) another PMPU, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) a PMPU, or if the applicability of this subpart to a storage tank has been determined according to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section and there is a significant change in the use of the storage tank that could reasonably change the predominant use, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to the storage tank and report such changes to EPA in the next Periodic report.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Compliance dates.</E> The compliance dates for affected sources are as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) For purposes of this subpart, a request for an extension shall be submitted no later than 120 days prior to the compliance dates specified in paragraphs (f) (1) through (5) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section. The dates specified in § 63.6(i) for submittal of requests for extensions shall not apply to sources subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request after the date specified in paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section provided the need for the compliance extension arose after that date and before the otherwise applicable compliance date, and the need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request shall include the data described in § 63.6(i)(6)(i) (A), (B), (C), and (D).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Applicability of this subpart.</E> (1) Each provision set forth in this subpart shall apply at all times, except that the provisions set forth in § 63.1255 of this subpart shall not apply during periods of nonoperation of the PMPU (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in the cessation of the emissions to which § 63.1255 of this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with the emissions limitations of this subpart during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment, if the shutdown would contravene emissions limitations of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph does not apply if the owner or operator must shut down the equipment to avoid damage to a PMPU or portion thereof.</P>

              <P>(3) At all times, each owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source subject to the requirements of this subpart, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by this standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.<PRTPAGE P="118"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, an owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by a malfunction, as defined in § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if owner or operator fails to meet the burden of proving all the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</P>
              <P>(i) To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, the owners or operators of a facility must timely meet the notification requirements of paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</P>
              <P>(A) The excess emissions were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, or a process to operate in a normal and usual manner; and could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design, or better operation and maintenance practices; and did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance;</P>
              <P>(B) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs;</P>
              <P>(C) The frequency, amount, and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions;</P>
              <P>(D) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;</P>
              <P>(E) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment, and human health;</P>
              <P>(F) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices;</P>
              <P>(G) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs;</P>
              <P>(H) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and</P>
              <P>(I) The owner or operator has prepared a written root cause analysis, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using the best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than 2 business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standard in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards: Equipment leaks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General equipment leak requirements.</E> (1) The provisions of this section apply to pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, control devices, and closed-vent systems required by this section that are intended to operate in organic hazardous air pollutant service 300 hours or more during the calendar year within a source subject to the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Consistency with other regulations.</E> After the compliance date for a process, equipment subject to both this section and either of the following will be required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart:</P>
              <P>(i) 40 CFR part 60.</P>
              <P>(ii) 40 CFR part 61.</P>
              <P>(3) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(4) The provisions in § 63.1(a)(3) of subpart A of this part do not alter the provisions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Lines and equipment not containing process fluids are not subject to the provisions of this section. Utilities, and other nonprocess lines, such as heating and cooling systems which do not combine their materials with those in the processes they serve, are not considered to be part of a process.</P>
              <P>(6) The provisions of this section do not apply to bench-scale processes, regardless of whether the processes are located at the same plant site as a process subject to the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(7) Equipment to which this section applies shall be identified such that it can be distinguished readily from equipment that is not subject to this section. Identification of the equipment does not require physical tagging of the equipment. For example, the equipment may be identified on a plant site plan, in log entries, or by designation of process boundaries by some form of weatherproof identification. If changes are made to the affected source subject to the leak detection requirements, equipment identification for each type of component shall be updated, if needed, within 90 calendar days or by the next Periodic Report following the end of the monitoring period for that component, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(8) Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) Equipment that is in organic HAP service, but is in such service less than 300 hours per calendar year, is excluded from the requirements of this section if it is identified as required in paragraph (g)(9) of this section.</P>

              <P>(10) When each leak is detected by visual, audible, or olfactory means, or by monitoring as described in § 63.180(b) or (c), the following requirements apply:<PRTPAGE P="141"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) A weatherproof and readily visible identification, marked with the equipment identification number, shall be attached to the leaking equipment.</P>
              <P>(ii) The identification on a valve in light liquid or gas/vapor service may be removed after it has been monitored as specified in paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, and no leak has been detected during the follow-up monitoring.</P>
              <P>(iii) The identification on equipment, except on a valve in light liquid or gas/vapor service, may be removed after it has been repaired.</P>
              <P>(11) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(11)(i) of this section, all terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual) refer to the standard calendar periods unless specified otherwise in the section or paragraph that imposes the requirement.</P>
              <P>(i) If the initial compliance date does not coincide with the beginning of the standard calendar period, an owner or operator may elect to utilize a period beginning on the compliance date, or may elect to comply in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(11)(ii) or (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Time periods specified in this subpart for completion of required tasks may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part. For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.</P>
              <P>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(11)(i) or (ii) of this section, where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date does not coincide with the beginning of the calendar period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraph (a)(11)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(A) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the initial compliance date occurs if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or</P>
              <P>(B) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance date occurs.</P>
              <P>(iv) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during each period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.</P>
              <P>(12) In all cases where the provisions of this subpart require an owner or operator to repair leaks by a specified time after the leak is detected, it is a violation of this section to fail to take action to repair the leaks within the specified time. If action is taken to repair the leaks within the specified time, failure of that action to successfully repair the leak is not a violation of this section. However, if the repairs are unsuccessful, a leak is detected and the owner or operator shall take further action as required by applicable provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">References.</E> (1) The owner or operator of a source subject to this section shall comply with the provisions of subpart H of this part, as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section.

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Design evaluation.</E> To demonstrate that a control device meets the required control efficiency, a design evaluation must address the composition and organic HAP concentration of the vent stream entering the control device. A design evaluation also must address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (vi) of this section, depending on the type of control device that is used.

The design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level and will include the additional information in paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) and (B) of this section for trays and a packed column scrubber.</P>
              <P>(A) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Calculation of TOC or total organic HAP concentration.</E> The TOC concentration or total organic HAP concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components. If compliance is being determined based on TOC, the owner or operator shall compute TOC for each run using Equation 6 of this subpart. If compliance with the wastewater provisions is being determined based on total organic HAP, the owner or operator shall compute total organic HAP using Equation 6 of this subpart, except that only the organic HAP compounds shall be summed; when determining compliance with paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, only the soluble and partially soluble HAP compounds shall be summed.</P>

              <P>(ii) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment at least once every 5 years.</P>
              <P>(8) Records shall be maintained as specified in § 63.1259(i) (4) through (9).</P>
              <P>(9) If a closed-vent system subject to this section is also subject to the equipment leak provisions of § 63.1255, the owner or operator shall comply with the provisions of § 63.1255 and is exempt from the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(10) Instead of complying with the provisions of paragraphs (h)(2) through (8) of this section, an owner or operator may design a closed-vent system to operate at a pressure below atmospheric pressure. The system shall be equipped with at least one pressure gauge or other pressure measurement device that can be read from a readily accessible location to verify that negative pressure is being maintained in the closed-vent system when the associated control device is operating.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability and designation of affected source.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart applies to owners and operators of natural gas transmission and storage facilities that transport or store natural gas prior to entering the pipeline to a local distribution company or to a final end user (if there is no local distribution company), and that are major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions as defined in § 63.1271. Emissions for major source determination purposes can be estimated using the maximum natural gas throughput calculated in either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section and paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section. As an alternative to calculating the maximum natural gas throughput, the owner or operator of a new or existing source may use the facility design maximum natural gas throughput to estimate the maximum potential emissions. Other means to determine the facility's major source status are allowed, provided the information is documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction in accordance with § 63.10(b)(3). A compressor station that transports natural gas prior to the point of custody transfer or to a natural gas processing plant (if present) is not considered a part of the natural gas transmission and storage source category. A facility that is determined to be an area source, but subsequently increases its emissions or its potential to emit above the major source levels (without obtaining and complying with other limitations that keep its potential to emit HAP below major source levels), and becomes a major source, must comply thereafter with all applicable provisions of this subpart starting on the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude a source from limiting its potential to emit through other appropriate mechanisms that may be available through the permitting authority.</P>
              <P>(1) Facilities that store natural gas or facilities that transport and store natural gas shall calculate maximum annual facility natural gas throughput using the following equation:</P>

              <P>(2) Facilities that only transport natural gas shall calculate the maximum natural gas throughput as the highest annual natural gas throughput over the 5 years prior to June 17, 1999, multiplied by a factor of 1.2.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator shall maintain records of the annual facility natural gas throughput each year and upon request, submit such records to the Administrator. If the facility annual natural gas throughput increases above the maximum natural gas throughput calculated in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the maximum natural gas throughput must be recalculated using the higher throughput multiplied by a factor of 1.2.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall determine the maximum values for other parameters used to calculate potential emissions as the maximum over the same period for which maximum throughput is determined as specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. These parameters shall be based on an annual average or the highest single measured value. For estimating maximum potential emissions from glycol dehydration units, the glycol circulation rate used in the calculation shall be the unit's maximum rate under its physical and operational design consistent with the definition of potential to emit in § 63.2.</P>
              <P>(b) The affected source is each new and existing glycol dehydration unit specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) Each large glycol dehydration unit;</P>
              <P>(2) Each small glycol dehydration unit for which construction commenced on or before August 23, 2011, is an existing small glycol dehydration unit.</P>
              <P>(3) Each small glycol dehydration unit for which construction commenced after August 23, 2011, is a new small glycol dehydration unit.</P>
              <P>(c) The owner or operator of a facility that does not contain an affected source, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, is not subject to the requirements of this subpart.</P>

The owner or operator of an area source, the construction or reconstruction of which commenced before February 6, 1998, that increases its emissions of (or its potential to emit) HAP such that the source becomes a major source that is subject to this subpart shall comply with this subpart 3 years after becoming a major source.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as specified in paragraphs (d)(3) through (4) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source, the construction or reconstruction of which commences on or after February 6, 1998, shall achieve compliance with the provisions of this subpart immediately upon initial startup or June 17, 1999, whichever date is later. Area sources, the construction or reconstruction of which commences on or after February 6, 1998, that become major sources shall comply with the provisions of this standard immediately upon becoming a major source.</P>
              <P>(3) Each affected small glycol dehydration unit, as defined in § 63.1271, located at a major source, that commenced construction before August 23, 2011, must achieve compliance no later than October 15, 2015, except as provided in § 63.6(i).</P>
              <P>(4) Each affected small glycol dehydration unit, as defined in § 63.1271, located at a major source, that commenced construction on or after August 23, 2011, must achieve compliance immediately upon initial startup or October 15, 2012, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(e) An owner or operator of an affected source that is a major source or is located at a major source and is subject to the provisions of this subpart is also subject to 40 CFR part 70 or part 71 permitting requirements.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> A facility with a facilitywide actual annual average natural gas throughput less than 28.3 thousand standard cubic meters per day, <PRTPAGE P="229"/>where glycol dehydration units are the only HAP emission source, is not subject to the requirements of this subpart.

Any emission points from such unit operations that are subject to another subpart of this part with an effective date prior to September 5, 1996 shall remain subject to that other subpart of this part and are not subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Primary product determination and applicability.</E> An owner or operator of a process unit that produces or plans to produce a thermoplastic product shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with this paragraph. The owner or operator shall initially determine whether a process unit is designated as a TPPU and subject to the provisions of this subpart in accordance with either paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section. The owner or operator of a flexible operation unit that was not initially designated as a TPPU, but in which a thermoplastic product is produced, shall conduct an annual re-determination of the applicability of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Owners or operators that anticipate the production of a thermoplastic product in a process unit that was not initially designated as a TPPU, and in which no thermoplastic products are currently produced, shall determine if the process unit is subject to this subpart in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(5) through (f)(7) of this section discuss compliance only for flexible operation units. Other paragraphs apply to all process units, including flexible operation units, unless otherwise noted. Paragraph (f)(8) of this section contains reporting requirements associated with the applicability determinations. Paragraphs (f)(9) and (f)(10) of this section describe criteria for removing the TPPU designation from a process unit.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> The owner or operator shall initially determine if a process unit is subject to the provisions of this subpart based on the primary product of the process unit in accordance with paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. If the process unit never uses or manufactures any organic HAP, regardless of the outcome of the primary product determination, the only requirements of this subpart that might apply to the process unit are contained in paragraph (b) of this section. If a flexible operation unit does not use or manufacture any organic HAP during the manufacture of one or more products, paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section applies to that flexible operation unit.</P>
              <P>(i) If a process unit only manufactures one product, then that product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a process unit produces more than one intended product at the same time, the primary product shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) The product for which the process unit has the greatest annual design capacity on a mass basis shall represent the primary product of the process unit, or</P>
              <P>(B) If a process unit has the same maximum annual design capacity on a mass basis for two or more products, and if one of those products is a thermoplastic product, then the thermoplastic product shall represent the primary product of the process unit.</P>

              <P>(iii) If a process unit is designed and operated as a flexible operation unit, the primary product shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section based on the anticipated operations for the 5 years following September 12, 1996 at <PRTPAGE P="281"/>existing process units, or for the first year after the process unit begins production of any product for new process units. If operations cannot be anticipated sufficiently to allow the determination of the primary product for the specified period, applicability shall be determined (in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture one product for the greatest operating time over the specified 5 year period for existing process units, or the specified 1 year period for new process units, then that product shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.</P>
              <P>(B) If the flexible operation unit will manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time, then the product with the greatest expected production on a mass basis over the specified 5 year period for existing process units, or the specified 1 year period for new process units shall represent the primary product of the flexible operation unit.</P>
              <P>(iv) If, according to paragraph (f)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the primary product of a process unit is a thermoplastic product, then that process unit shall be designated as a TPPU. That TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is either an affected source or part of an affected source comprised of other TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. If the primary product of a process unit is determined to be a product that is not a thermoplastic product, then that process unit is not a TPPU.</P>
              <P>(2) If the primary product cannot be determined for a flexible operation unit in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, applicability shall be determined in accordance with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(i) If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, but can determine that a thermoplastic product is not the primary product, then that flexible operation unit is not a TPPU.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the owner or operator cannot determine the primary product in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, and cannot determine that a thermoplastic product is not the primary product as specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, applicability shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) or (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) If the flexible operation unit is an existing process unit, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as a TPPU if a thermoplastic product was produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating time of the flexible operating unit since March 9, 1999. That TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. For a flexible operation unit that is designated as an TPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the thermoplastic product produced for the greatest amount of time since March 9, 1999 shall be designated as the primary product of the TPPU.</P>

              <P>(B) If the flexible operation unit is a new process unit, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as a TPPU if the owner or operator anticipates that a thermoplastic product will be manufactured in the flexible operation unit at any time in the first year after the date the unit begins production of any product. That TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, is either an affected source, or part of an affected source comprised of other TPPU and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, subject to this subpart with the same primary product at the same plant site that is a major source. For a process unit that is designated as a TPPU in accordance with this paragraph, the thermoplastic product that will be produced shall be designated as the primary product of the TPPU. If more than one thermoplastic product will be produced, the owner or <PRTPAGE P="282"/>operator may select which thermoplastic product is designated as the primary product.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Annual applicability determination for non-TPPUs that have produced a thermoplastic product.</E> Once per year beginning September 12, 2001, the owner or operator of each flexible operation unit that is not designated as a TPPU, but that has produced a thermoplastic product at any time in the preceding 5-year period or since the date that the unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform the evaluation described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section. However, an owner or operator that does not intend to produce any thermoplastic product in the future, in accordance with paragraph (f)(9) of this section, is not required to perform the evaluation described in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For each product produced in the flexible operation unit, the owner or operator shall calculate the percentage of total operating time over which the product was produced during the preceding 5-year period.</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator shall identify the primary product as the product with the highest percentage of total operating time for the preceding 5-year period.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the primary product identified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) is a thermoplastic product, the flexible operation unit shall be designated as a TPPU. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator no later than 45 days after determining that the flexible operation unit is a TPPU, and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section for the flexible operation unit.</P>

After the compliance dates specified in this section, the distillation operation shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart NNN.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Applicability of other regulations for monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting with respect to combustion devices, recovery devices, or recapture devices.</E> After the compliance dates specified in this subpart, if any combustion device, recovery device or recapture device subject to this subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264 subpart AA or CC, or is subject to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 265 subpart AA or CC and the owner or operator complies with the periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264 subpart AA or CC that would apply to the device if the facility had final-permitted status, the owner or operator may elect to comply either with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart, or with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in this paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart. The owner or operator shall identify which option has been selected in the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.1335(e)(5).</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Applicability of other requirements for heat exchange systems or waste management units.</E> Paragraphs (n)(1) and (n)(2) of this section address instances in which certain requirements from other regulations also apply for the same heat exchange system(s) or waste management unit(s) that are subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, if a heat exchange system subject to this subpart is also subject to a standard identified in paragraphs (n)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in paragraphs (n)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that heat exchange system.</P>
              <P>(i) Subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with § 63.104 (e.g., subpart U of this part).</P>
              <P>(2) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, if any waste management unit subject to this subpart is also subject to a standard identified in paragraph (n)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in paragraph (n)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that waste management unit.</P>
              <P>(i) Subpart G of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) A subpart of this part which requires compliance with §§ 63.132 through 63.147.</P>
              <P>(o) All terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual), unless specified otherwise in the section or paragraph that imposes the requirement, refer to the standard calendar periods.</P>

              <P>(1) Notwithstanding time periods specified in this subpart for completion of required tasks, such time periods may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part (e.g., a period could begin on the compliance date or another date, rather than on the first day of the standard calendar period). For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not necessary for each recurring period.<PRTPAGE P="293"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Where the period specified for compliance is a standard calendar period, if the initial compliance date occurs after the beginning of the period, compliance shall be required according to the schedule specified in paragraphs (o)(2)(i) or (o)(2)(ii) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(i) Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least 2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for tasks that must be performed annually; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which the initial compliance deadline occurs.</P>
              <P>(3) In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during the specified period, provided that the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after completion of the task during the previous period.</P>

This determination may be based on either organic HAP or TOC emissions.</P>
              <P>(1) The procedures specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section shall be followed to determine the group status of each batch process vent. This determination shall be made in accordance with either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of a batch process vent based on the expected mix of products. For each product, emission characteristics of the single highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, for that product shall be used in the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) An owner or operator may choose to determine the group status of a batch process vent based on annualized production of the single highest-HAP recipe, as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, considering all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation. The annualized production of the highest-HAP recipe shall be based exclusively on the production of the single highest-HAP recipe of all products produced or processed in the batch unit operation for a 12 month period. The production level used may be the actual production rate. It is not necessary to assume a maximum production rate (i.e., 8,760 hours per year at maximum design production).</P>
              <P>(iii) The single highest-HAP recipe for a product means the recipe of the product with the highest total mass of HAP charged to the reactor during the production of a single batch of product.</P>
              <P>(2) The annual uncontrolled organic HAP or TOC emissions and annual average batch vent flow rate shall be determined at the exit from the batch unit operation. For the purposes of these determinations, the primary condenser operating as a reflux condenser on a reactor or distillation column, the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, by-products, or solvent from a stripper operated in batch mode, and the primary condenser recovering monomer, reaction products, by-products, or solvent from a distillation operation operated in batch mode shall be considered part of the batch unit operation. All other devices that recover or oxidize organic HAP or TOC vapors shall be considered control devices as defined in § 63.1312.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of annual emissions.</E> The owner or operator shall calculate annual uncontrolled TOC or organic HAP emissions for each batch process vent using the methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of this section. To estimate emissions from a batch emissions episode, owners or operators may use either the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, or direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Engineering assessment may be used to estimate emissions from a batch emission episode only under the conditions described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. In using the emissions estimation equations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, individual component vapor pressure and molecular weight may be obtained from standard references. Methods to determine individual HAP partial pressures in multicomponent systems are described in paragraph (b)(9) of this section. Other variables in the emissions estimation equations may be obtained through direct measurement, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, through engineering assessment, as defined in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, by process knowledge, or by any other appropriate means. Assumptions used in determining these variables must be documented. Once emissions for the batch emission episode have been determined using either the emissions estimation equations, direct measurement, or engineering assessment, emissions from a batch cycle shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, and annual emissions from the batch process vent shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(8) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) A boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or greater.</P>
              <P>(2) A boiler or process heater where the vent stream is introduced with the primary fuel or is used as the primary fuel.</P>
              <P>(3) A control device for which a performance test was conducted for determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA and the test was conducted using the same Methods specified in this section and either no deliberate process changes have been made since the test, or the owner or operator can demonstrate that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. Recovery devices used for controlling emissions from continuous process vents complying with § 63.1322(a)(3) are also eligible for the exemption described in this paragraph (b)(3).</P>
              <P>(4) A boiler or process heater burning hazardous waste for which the owner or operator:</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Batch process vent testing and procedures for compliance with § 63.1322(a)(2).</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, an <PRTPAGE P="333"/>owner or operator using a control device to comply with § 63.1322(a)(2) shall conduct a performance test using the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in order to determine the control efficiency of the control device. An owner or operator shall determine the percent reduction for the batch cycle using the control efficiency of the control device as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii) of this section and the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Compliance may be based on either total organic HAP or TOC. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term “batch emission episode” shall have the meaning “period of the batch emission episode selected for control,” which may be the entire batch emission episode or may only be a portion of the batch emission episode.</P>
              <P>(1) Performance tests shall be conducted as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section, a test shall be performed for the entire period of each batch emission episode in the batch cycle that the owner or operator selects to control as part of achieving the required 90 percent emission reduction for the batch cycle specified in § 63.1322(a)(2).

The owner or operator choosing either of these options shall develop an emission profile for the entire batch emission episode, based on either process knowledge or test data collected, to demonstrate that test periods are representative. Examples of information that could constitute process knowledge include calculations based on material balances and process stoichiometry. Previous test results may be used provided the results are still relevant to the current batch process vent conditions.</P>

              <P>(B) Method 1 or 1A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling sites if the flow measuring device is a pitot tube, except that references to particulate matter in Method 1A do not apply for the purposes of this subpart. No traverse is necessary when Method 2A or 2D, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is used to determine gas stream volumetric flow rate. Inlet sampling sites shall be located as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (c)(1)(i)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section. Outlet sampling sites shall be located at the outlet of the control device prior to release to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The control device inlet sampling site shall be located at the exit from the batch unit operation before any control device. § 63.1323(a)(2) describes those recovery devices considered part of the unit operation. Inlet sampling sites would be after these specified recovery devices.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If a batch process vent is introduced with the combustion air or as a secondary fuel into a boiler or process heater with a design capacity less than 44 megawatts, selection of the location of the inlet sampling sites shall ensure the measurement of total organic HAP or TOC (minus methane and ethane) concentrations in all batch process vents and primary and secondary fuels introduced into the boiler or process heater.</P>
              <P>(C) Gas stream volumetric flow rate and/or average batch vent flow rate shall be determined as specified in § 63.1323(e).</P>

              <P>(D) Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be used to determine the concentration of organic HAP or TOC, as appropriate. Alternatively, any other method or data that has been validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part may be used. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (c)(1)(i)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.<PRTPAGE P="334"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.</P>
              <P>(ii) If an integrated sample is taken over the entire test period to determine average batch vent concentration of TOC or total organic HAP, emissions per batch emission episode shall be calculated using Equations 19 and 20 of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(21) The owner or operator of a facility which receives a Group 1 wastewater stream, or a residual removed from a Group 1 wastewater stream, for treatment pursuant to § 63.132(g) is subject to the requirements of § 63.132(g) with the differences identified in this section, and is not subject to subpart DD of this part with respect to that material.</P>
              <P>(22) When § 63.132(g) refers to “§§ 63.133 through 63.137” or “§§ 63.133 through 63.147”, the provisions in this section 63.1330 shall apply, for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) For each affected source, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements for maintenance wastewater in § 63.105, except that when § 63.105(a) refers to “organic HAPs listed in table 9 of subpart G of this part,” the owner or operator is only required to consider compounds that meet the definition of organic HAP in § 63.1312 and that are listed in table 9 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart G, except for ethylene glycol which need not be considered, for the purposes of this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Equipment leak provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except § 63.165 and as provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the owner or operator of each affected source shall comply with the requirements of subpart H of this part, with the differences noted in paragraphs (a)(1) through (13) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) For an affected source producing polystyrene resin, the indications of liquids dripping, as defined in subpart H of this part, from bleed ports in pumps and agitator seals in light liquid service shall not be considered to be a leak. For purposes of this subpart, a “bleed port” is a technologically-required feature of the pump or seal whereby polymer fluid used to provide lubrication and/or cooling of the pump or agitator shaft exits the pump, thereby resulting in a visible dripping of fluid.</P>
              <P>(2) The compliance date for the equipment leak provisions contained in this section is provided in § 63.1311. Whenever subpart H of this part refers to the compliance dates specified in any paragraph contained in § 63.100, the compliance dates listed in § 63.1311(d) shall instead apply, for the purposes of this subpart. When § 63.182(c)(4) refers to “sources subject to subpart F,” the phrase “sources subject to this subpart” shall apply, for the purposes of this subpart. In addition, extensions of compliance dates are addressed by § 63.1311(e) instead of § 63.182(a)(6), for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) Owners and operators of an affected source subject to this subpart are not required to submit the Initial Notification required by § 63.182(a)(1) and § 63.182(b).</P>
              <P>(4) As specified in § 63.1335(e)(5), the Notification of Compliance Status required by paragraphs § 63.182(a)(2) and § 63.182(c) shall be submitted within 150 days (rather than 90 days) of the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.1311 for the equipment leak provisions.</P>

              <P>(5) The information specified by § 63.182(a)(3) and § 63.182(d) (i.e., Periodic <PRTPAGE P="348"/>Reports) shall be submitted as part of the Periodic Reports required by § 63.1335(e)(6).</P>
              <P>(6) For pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in heavy liquid service; pressure relief devices in light liquid or heavy liquid service; and instrumentation systems; owners or operators of affected sources producing PET shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section instead of with the requirements of § 63.139. Owners or operators of PET affected sources shall comply with all other provisions of subpart H of this part for pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in heavy liquid service; pressure relief devices in light liquid or heavy liquid service; and instrumentation systems, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(6)(iii) through (v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) A leak is determined to be detected if there is evidence of a potential leak found by visual, audible, or olfactory means. Method 21, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A may not be used to determine the presence or absence of a leak.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practical, but not later than 15 days after it is detected, except as provided in § 63.171.</P>
              <P>(B) The first attempt at repair shall be made no later than 5 days after each leak is detected.</P>
              <P>(C) Repaired shall mean that the visual, audible, olfactory, or other indications of a leak have been eliminated; that no bubbles are observed at potential leak sites during a leak check using soap solution; or that the system will hold a test pressure.</P>
              <P>(iii) An owner or operator is not required to develop an initial list of identification numbers as would otherwise be required under § 63.181(b)(1)(i) or § 63.181(b)(4).</P>
              <P>(iv) When recording the detection of a leak under § 63.182(d)(1), the owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with paragraphs (a)(6)(iv)(A) through (a)(6)(iv)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) When complying with § 63.181(d)(1), provide an identification number for the leaking equipment at the time of recordkeeping. Further, the owner or operator is not required to record the identification number of the instrument (i.e., Method 21 instrument) because the use of Method 21 is not an acceptable method for determining a leak under this paragraph (a)(6).</P>
              <P>(B) An owner or operator is not required to comply with § 63.181(d)(4) which requires a record of the maximum instrument reading measured by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(v) Indications of liquids dripping, as defined in subpart H of this part, from packing glands for pumps in ethylene glycol service where the pump seal is designed to weep fluid shall not be considered to be a leak. Ethylene glycol dripping from pump seals must be captured in a catchpan and returned to the process.</P>
              <P>(7) When § 63.166(b)(4)(i) refers to Table 9 of subpart G of this part, the owner or operator is only required to consider organic HAP listed on Table 6 of this subpart for purposes of this subpart, except for ethylene glycol which need not be considered.</P>
              <P>(8) When the provisions of subpart H of this part specify that Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used, Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used for the purposes of this subpart. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (a)(8)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.</P>
              <P>(ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Requirements for pressure relief devices.</E> Except as specified in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator must comply with the operating and pressure release requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (ii) of this section for pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service. Except as specified in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section, the <PRTPAGE P="349"/>owner or operator must also comply with the pressure release management requirements specified in paragraph (a)(9)(iii) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Operating requirements.</E> Except during a pressure release event, operate each pressure relief device in organic HAP gas or vapor service with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background as detected by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Pressure release requirements.</E> For pressure relief devices in organic HAP gas or vapor service, comply with paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(A) If the pressure relief device does not consist of or include a rupture disk, conduct instrument monitoring, as detected by Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, except as provided in § 63.171.</P>
              <P>(B) If the pressure relief device consists of or includes a rupture disk, install a replacement disk as soon as practicable after a pressure release, but no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release, except as provided in § 63.171.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Pressure release management.</E> Except as specified in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section, pressure releases to the atmosphere from pressure relief devices in organic HAP service are prohibited, and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(9)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.</P>
              <P>(A) For each pressure relief device in organic HAP service, the owner or operator must equip each pressure relief device with a device(s) or use a monitoring system that is capable of:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Identifying the pressure release;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Recording the time and duration of each pressure release; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Notifying operators immediately that a pressure release is occurring. The device or monitoring system may be either specific to the pressure relief device itself or may be associated with the process system or piping, sufficient to indicate a pressure release to the atmosphere. Examples of these types of devices and systems include, but are not limited to, a rupture disk indicator, magnetic sensor, motion detector on the pressure relief valve stem, flow monitor, or pressure monitor.</P>
              <P>(B) If any pressure relief device in organic HAP service releases to atmosphere as a result of a pressure release event, the owner or operator must calculate the quantity of organic HAP released during each pressure release event and report this quantity as required in § 63.1335(e)(6)(xiii). Calculations may be based on data from the pressure relief device monitoring alone or in combination with process parameter monitoring data and process knowledge.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Pressure relief devices routed to a control device, process, or drain system.</E> If a pressure relief device in organic HAP service is designed and operated to route all pressure releases through a closed vent system to a control device, process, or drain system, the owner or operator is not required to comply with paragraphs (a)(9)(i), (ii), or (iii) (if applicable) of this section. Both the closed vent system and control device (if applicable) must meet the requirements of § 63.172. The drain system (if applicable) must meet the requirements of § 63.136.</P>
              <P>(10) If specific items of equipment, comprising part of a process unit subject to this subpart, are managed by different administrative organizations (e.g., different companies, affiliates, departments, divisions, etc.), those items of equipment may be aggregated with any TPPU within the affected source for all purposes under subpart H of this part, providing there is no delay in achieving the applicable compliance date.</P>
              <P>(11) When the terms “equipment” and “equipment leak” are used in subpart H of this part, the definitions of these terms in § 63.1312 shall apply for the purposes of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(12) The phrase “the provisions of subparts F, I, or JJJ of this part” shall apply instead of the phrase “the provisions of subpart F or I of this part” throughout §§ 63.163 and 63.168, for the purposes of this subpart. In addition, the phrase “subparts F, I, and JJJ” <PRTPAGE P="350"/>shall apply instead of the phrase “subparts F and I” in § 63.174(c)(2)(iii), for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(13) An owner or operator using a flare to comply with the requirements of this section shall conduct a compliance demonstration as specified in § 63.1333(e).</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of this section do not apply to each TPPU producing PET using a process other than a continuous terephthalic acid (TPA) high viscosity multiple end finisher process that is part of an affected source if all of the equipment leak components subject to this section § 63.1331 in the TPPU are either in vacuum service or in heavy liquid service.</P>
              <P>(1) Owners and operators of a TPPU exempted under paragraph (b) of this section shall comply with paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Retain information, data, and analyses used to demonstrate that all of the components in the exempted TPPU are either in vacuum service or in heavy liquid service. For components in vacuum service, examples of information that could document this include, but are not limited to, analyses of process stream composition and process conditions, engineering calculations, or process knowledge. For components in heavy liquid service, such documentation shall include an analysis or demonstration that the process fluids do not meet the criteria of “in light liquid service” or “in gas or vapor service.”</P>
              <P>(ii) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that all of the components in the TPPU are either in vacuum service or in heavy liquid service.</P>
              <P>(2) If changes occur at a TPPU exempted under paragraph (b) of this section such that all of the components in the TPPU are no longer either in vacuum service or in heavy liquid service (e.g., by either process changes or the addition of new components), the owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with the provisions of this section for all of the components at the TPPU. The owner or operator shall submit a report within 180 days after the process change is made or the information regarding the process change is known to the owner or operator. This report may be included in the next Periodic Report, as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. A description of the process change shall be submitted with this report.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Each affected source producing PET using a continuous TPA high viscosity multiple end finisher process shall monitor for leaks upon startup following an outage where changes have been made to equipment in gas/vapor or light liquid service. This leak check shall consist of the introduction of hot ethylene glycol vapors into the system for a period of no less than 2 hours during which time sensory monitoring of the equipment shall be conducted.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emissions averaging provisions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing affected sources who seek to comply with § 63.1313(b) by <PRTPAGE P="351"/>using emissions averaging rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 63.1321, and 63.1330.</P>
              <P>(1) The following emission point limitations apply to the use of these provisions:</P>
              <P>(i) All emission points included in an emissions average shall be from the same affected source. There may be an emissions average for each affected source located at a plant site.</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) If a plant site has only one affected source for which emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number of emission points allowed in the emissions average for said affected source is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five additional emission points if pollution prevention measures are used to control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions average.</P>
              <P>(B) If a plant site has two or more affected sources for which emissions averaging is being used to demonstrate compliance, the number of emission points allowed in the emissions averages for said affected sources is limited to twenty. This number may be increased by up to five additional emission points if pollution prevention measures are used to control five or more of the emission points included in the emissions averages.</P>
              <P>(2) Compliance with the provisions of this section may be based on either organic HAP or TOC.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purposes of these provisions, whenever Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is specified within the paragraphs of this section or is specified by reference through provisions outside this section, Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used. The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The organic HAP used as the calibration gas for Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A shall be the single organic HAP representing the largest percent by volume of the emissions.</P>
              <P>(ii) The use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A is acceptable if the response from the high-level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on the most sensitive scale.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless an operating permit application has been submitted, the owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Emissions Averaging Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.1335(e)(4) for all emission points to be included in an emissions average.</P>
              <P>(c) Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this section describe the emission points that may be used to generate emissions averaging credits if control was applied after November 15, 1990, and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point. Paragraph (c)(6) of this section discusses the use of pollution prevention in generating emissions averaging credits.</P>
              <P>(1) Storage vessels, batch process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, continuous process vents subject to § 63.1315, and process wastewater streams that are determined to be Group 2 emission points. The term “continuous process vents subject to § 63.1315” includes continuous process vents subject to § 63.1316 (b)(1)(iii), (b)(2)(iii), and (c)(2), which reference § 63.1315.</P>
              <P>(2) Continuous process vents located in the collection of material recovery sections within the affected source at an existing affected source producing PET using a continuous dimethyl terephthalate process subject to § 63.1316(b)(1)(i) where the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from said continuous process vents are equal to or less than 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product. These continuous process vents shall be considered Group 2 emission points for the purposes of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) Storage vessels, continuous process vents subject to § 63.1315, and process wastewater streams that are determined to be Group 1 emission points and that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the <PRTPAGE P="352"/>nominal efficiencies for such technologies shall be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Batch process vents and aggregate batch vent streams that are determined to be Group 1 emission points and that are controlled to a level more stringent than the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(5) Continuous process vents subject to § 63.1316 (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1) located in the collection of process sections within the affected source, as specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(ii) of this section. The continuous process vents identified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (c)(5)(ii) of this section shall be considered to be Group 1 emission points for the purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Continuous process vents subject to § 63.1316(b)(1)(i) located in the collection of material recovery sections within the affected source where the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions for said continuous process vents are greater than 0.12 kg organic HAP per Mg of product and said continuous process vents are controlled to a level more stringent than the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(ii) Continuous process vents subject to § 63.1316(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1) located in the collection of process sections within the affected source where the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from said continuous process vents are controlled to a level more stringent than the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(6) The percent reduction for any storage vessel, batch process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous process vent, and process wastewater stream from which emissions are reduced by pollution prevention measures shall be determined using the procedures specified in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For a Group 1 storage vessel, batch process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous process vent, or process wastewater stream, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than if the applicable reference control technology or standard had been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure, except as provided in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 storage vessel, batch process vent, aggregate batch vent stream, continuous process vent, or process wastewater stream, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the applicable reference control technology or standard, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than if the applicable reference control technology or standard had been applied instead of the pollution prevention measure.</P>
              <P>(d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:</P>
              <P>(1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990, cannot be used to generate credits unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990. In this case, credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.</P>
              <P>(2) Group 1 emission points, identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, that are controlled by a reference control technology cannot be used to generate credits unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Emission points for nonoperating TPPU cannot be used to generate credits. TPPU that are shutdown cannot be used to generate credits or debits.</P>
              <P>(4) Maintenance wastewater cannot be used to generate credits. Wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units cannot be used to generate credits. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms wastewater and wastewater stream are used to mean process wastewater.</P>

              <P>(5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart cannot be used to generate credits, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990, to a level above what is required by the other State or Federal <PRTPAGE P="353"/>rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the emission point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the emission point may continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved emissions average.</P>
              <P>(e) For all emission points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall perform the following tasks:</P>
              <P>(1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology or standard for those emission points. Said Group 1 emission points are identified in paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of this section. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.</P>
              <P>(2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 and Group 2 emission points that are over-controlled to compensate for the debits.

              <P>(2) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days whether an application presents sufficient information to determine nominal efficiency. The Administrator reserves the right to request specific data in addition to the items listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) The Administrator shall determine within 120 days of the submittal of sufficient data whether a control technology shall have a nominal efficiency and the level of that nominal efficiency. If, in the Administrator's judgment, the control technology achieves a level of emission reduction greater than the reference control technology for a particular kind of emission point, the Administrator will publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice establishing a nominal efficiency for the control technology.</P>
              <P>(4) The Administrator may grant permission to take emission credits for use of the control technology. The Administrator may also impose requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the specified nominal efficiency.</P>
              <P>(5) In those cases where the owner or operator is seeking permission to take credit for use of a control technology that is different in use or design from the reference control technology and the different control technology will be used in no more than three applications at a single plant site, the owner or operator shall submit the information listed in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iv) of this section, as specified in § 63.1335(e)(7)(ii), to the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(i) In these instances, use and conditions for use of the control technology may be approved by the permitting authority as part of an operating permit <PRTPAGE P="365"/>application or modification. The permitting authority shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (i)(2) through (i)(4) of this section except that, in these instances, a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice is not required to establish the nominal efficiency for the different technology.</P>

              <P>(ii) If, in reviewing the application, the permitting authority believes the control technology has broad applicability for use by other affected sources, the permitting authority shall submit the information provided in the application to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. The Administrator shall review the technology for broad applicability and may publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice; however, this review shall not affect the permitting authority's approval of the nominal efficiency of the control technology for the specific application.</P>
              <P>(6) If, in reviewing an application for a control technology for an emission point, the Administrator or permitting authority determines the control technology is not different in use or design from the reference control technology, the Administrator or permitting authority shall deny the application.</P>
              <P>(j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the efficiency (percent reduction) of pollution prevention measures for storage vessels, continuous process vents, batch process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, and wastewater streams:</P>
              <P>(1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that meets the criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control of emissions, while the same product is produced.</P>
              <P>(ii) Pollution prevention measures may include: substitution of feedstocks that reduce organic HAP emissions; alterations to the production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the environment; equipment modifications; housekeeping measures; and in-process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution prevention.</P>
              <P>(2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention measures implemented after November 15, 1990, may be used in calculating the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For pollution prevention measures, the percent reduction used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(7) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(7) of this section is the percent difference between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods.</P>
              <P>(ii) Equation 46 of this subpart shall be used to calculate the percent reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Additional requirements for performance testing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested and in accordance with § 63.7(a)(1), (a)(3), (d), (e)(2), (e)(4), (g), and (h), with the exceptions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section and the additions specified in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests. Sections 63.1314 through 63.1330 also contain specific testing requirements.</P>
              <P>(1) Performance tests shall be conducted according to the provisions of § 63.7(e)(2), except that performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions achievable during one of the time periods described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, without causing any of the situations described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section to occur.</P>
              <P>(i) The 6-month period that ends 2 months before the Notification of Compliance Status is due, according to § 63.1335(e)(5); or the 6-month period that begins 3 months before the performance test and ends 3 months after the performance test.</P>
              <P>(ii) Causing damage to equipment; necessitating that the owner or operator make product that does not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer; or necessitating that the owner or operator make product in excess of demand.</P>
              <P>(2) The requirements in § 63.1335(e)(5) shall apply instead of the references in § 63.7(g) to the Notification of Compliance Status requirements in § 63.9(h).</P>
              <P>(3) Because the site-specific test plans in § 63.7(c)(3) are not required, § 63.7(h)(4)(ii) is not applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the intention to conduct a performance test at least 30 days before the performance test is scheduled to allow the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test. If after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.</P>
              <P>(5) Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for the results to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status), rather than according to the time periods in § 63.7(a)(2) of subpart A of this part.</P>

              <P>(b) Each owner or operator of an existing affected source producing MBS complying with § 63.1315(b)(2) shall determine compliance with the mass emission per mass product standard by using Equation 49 of this subpart. When determining E<E T="52">i</E>, when the provisions of § 63.116(c)(4) specify that Method 18, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall be used, Method 18 or Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, may be used for the purposes of this subpart. The <PRTPAGE P="370"/>use of Method 25A, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, shall conform with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. During periods of startup or shutdown, as an alternative to using Equation 49 of this subpart, the owner or operator may divide the emission rate of total organic HAP or TOC during startup or shutdown by the rate of polymer produced from the most recent performance test associated with a production rate greater than zero to comply with the emission limit.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Establishment of parameter monitoring levels.</E> The owner or operator of a control or recovery device that has one or more parameter monitoring level requirements specified under this subpart shall establish a maximum or minimum level for each measured parameter. If a performance test is required by this subpart for a control device, the owner or operator shall use the procedures in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring level(s). If a performance test is not required by this subpart for a control device, the owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring level(s). When using the procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in § 63.1335(e)(3)(vii) for review and approval as part of the Precompliance Report.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall operate control and recovery devices such that the daily average of monitored parameters remains above the minimum established level or below the maximum established level, except as otherwise stated in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) As specified in § 63.1335(e)(5), all established levels, along with their supporting documentation and the definition of an operating day, shall be submitted as part of the Notification of Compliance Status.</P>
              <P>(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable provisions of subpart A, F, G, or H of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based exclusively on performance tests.</E> In cases where a performance test is required by this subpart, or the owner or operator of the affected source elects to do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device based exclusively on parameter values measured during the performance test, the owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Continuous process vents.</E> During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be continuously monitored during the required 1-hour runs. The monitoring level(s) shall then be established as the average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from the three test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be used when establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum values shall be used when establishing a minimum level.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Batch process vents.</E> The monitoring level(s) shall be established using the procedures specified in either paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The procedures specified in this paragraph (b)(3) may only be used <PRTPAGE P="372"/>if the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, selected to be controlled were tested, and monitoring data were collected, during the entire period in which emissions were vented to the control device, as specified in § 63.1325(c)(1)(i). If the owner or operator chose to test only a portion of the batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled, the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section shall be used.</P>
              <P>(i) If more than one batch emission episode or more than one portion of a batch emission episode has been selected to be controlled, a single level for the batch cycle shall be calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) The average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled. The average shall be based on all values measured during the required performance test.</P>
              <P>(B) If the level to be established is a maximum operating parameter, the level shall be defined as the minimum of the average parameter values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the lowest parameter value in order to assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).</P>
              <P>(C) If the level to be established is a minimum operating parameter, the level shall be defined as the maximum of the average parameter values of the batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle selected to be controlled (i.e., identify the emission episode, or portion thereof, which requires the highest parameter value in order to assure compliance. The average parameter value that is necessary to assure compliance for that emission episode, or portion thereof, shall be the level for all emission episodes, or portions thereof, in the batch cycle, that are selected to be controlled).</P>
              <P>(D) Alternatively, an average monitored parameter value shall be calculated for the entire batch cycle based on all values measured during each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled.</P>
              <P>(ii) Instead of establishing a single level for the batch cycle, as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator may establish separate levels for each batch emission episode, or portion thereof, selected to be controlled. Each level shall be determined as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) The batch cycle shall be defined in the Notification of Compliance Status, as specified in § 63.1335(e)(5). Said definition shall include an identification of each batch emission episode and the information required to determine parameter monitoring compliance for partial batch cycles (i.e., when part of a batch cycle is accomplished during two different operating days).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Aggregate batch vent streams.</E> For aggregate batch vent streams, the monitoring level shall be established in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Establishment of parameter monitoring levels based on performance tests, supplemented by engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations.</E> In cases where a performance test is required by this subpart, or the owner or operator elects to do a performance test in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (c), the owner or operator shall supplement the parameter values measured during the performance test with engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. Performance testing is not required to be conducted over the entire range of expected parameter values.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Establishment of parameter monitoring based on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations.</E> In cases where a performance test is not required by this subpart and an owner or operator elects to establish a parameter monitoring level for a control, recovery, or recapture device under this paragraph (d), the determination of the parameter monitoring <PRTPAGE P="373"/>level shall be based exclusively on engineering assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Parameter monitoring excursion definitions.</E> (1) With respect to storage vessels (where the applicable monitoring plan specifies continuous monitoring), continuous process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, and process wastewater streams, an excursion means any of the three cases listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this section. For a control or recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iii) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control or recovery device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(i) When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given parameters.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, is 4 hours or greater in an operating day, and monitoring data are insufficient, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, to constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours.</P>
              <P>(iii) When the period of control or recovery device operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, is less than 4 hours in an operating day and more than two of the hours during the period of operation do not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient monitoring data, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of data, as used in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section, if measured values are unavailable for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data compression systems approved under § 63.1335(g)(3), monitoring data are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less than four data measurements made during the hour.</P>
              <P>(v) The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(1)(v)(A) and (B) of this section are not considered to be part of the period of control or recovery device operation, for the purposes of paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; or</P>
              <P>(B) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to batch process vents, an excursion means one of the two cases listed in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section. For a control device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria in either paragraph (f)(2)(i) or (f)(2)(ii) of this section, this is considered a single excursion for the control device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(i) When the batch cycle daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is above the maximum or below the minimum established level for the given parameters.</P>
              <P>(ii) When monitoring data are insufficient for an operating day. Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device during the operating day, using the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(A) through (f)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device.</P>

              <P>(B) Subtract the time during the periods of monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments from the total amount of time determined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, to obtain the operating <PRTPAGE P="374"/>time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient.</P>
              <P>(C) Determine the total number of 15-minute periods in the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(D) If measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the total number of 15-minute periods determined in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the monitoring data are insufficient for the operating day.</P>
              <P>(3) For storage vessels where the applicable monitoring plan does not specify continuous monitoring, an excursion is defined in paragraph (f)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable. For a control or recovery device where multiple parameters are monitored, if one or more of the parameters meets the excursion criteria, this is considered a single excursion for the control or recovery device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(i) If the monitoring plan specifies monitoring a parameter and recording its value at specific intervals (such as every 15 minutes or every hour), either of the cases listed in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(A) or (f)(3)(i)(B) of this section is considered a single excursion for the control device. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(A) When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over the duration of the filling period for the storage vessel, is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given parameters.</P>
              <P>(B) When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of the specific intervals at which parameters are to be monitored and recorded, according to the storage vessel's monitoring plan, during the filling period for the storage vessel.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating requirement.</P>
              <P>(4) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the mass emissions per mass product requirements specified in § 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), or (c)(1)(i), an excursion has occurred when the mass emission rate calculated as specified in § 63.1318(c) exceeds the appropriate mass emissions per mass product requirement. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the temperature limits for final condensers specified in § 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(ii), an excursion has occurred when the daily average exit temperature exceeds the appropriate condenser temperature limit. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart. The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section are not considered to be part of the period of operation for the condenser for purposes of determining the daily average exit temperature.</P>
              <P>(i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.</P>
              <P>(6) With respect to new affected sources producing SAN using a batch process, an excursion has occurred when the percent reduction calculated using the procedures specified in § 63.1333(c) is less than 84 percent. For each excursion, the owner or operator shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart. The periods listed in paragraphs (f)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section are not considered to be part of the period of control or recovery device operation for purposes of determining the percent reduction.</P>

              <P>(i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero <PRTPAGE P="375"/>(low-level) and high-level adjustments; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.</P>
              <P>(7) With respect to continuous process vents complying with the mass emissions per mass product requirement specified in § 63.1315(b)(2), an excursion has occurred when the mass emission rate calculated as specified in § 63.1333(b) exceeds the mass emissions per mass product requirement specified in § 63.1315(b)(2).

If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to § 63.1314(a)(9) requires continuous records, the monitoring plan shall specify which provisions, if any, of paragraphs (d)(1) through (10) of this section apply. As described in § 63.1314(a)(9), certain storage vessels are not required to keep continuous records as specified in this paragraph.

              <P>(g) <E T="03">Alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping.</E> An owner or operator choosing not to implement the provisions listed in § 63.1315 or § 63.1317, as appropriate, for continuous process vents, § 63.1321 for batch process vents and aggregate batch vent streams, or § 63.1330 for process wastewater, may instead request approval to use alternative continuous monitoring and recordkeeping provisions according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section. Requests shall be submitted in the Precompliance Report as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, if not already included in the operating permit application, and shall contain the information specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) The provisions in § 63.8(f)(5)(i) shall govern the review and approval of requests.</P>
              <P>(2) An owner or operator of an affected source that does not have an automated monitoring and recording system capable of measuring parameter values at least once every 15 minutes and that does not generate continuous records may request approval to use a nonautomated system with less frequent monitoring, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The requested system shall include manual reading and recording of the value of the relevant operating parameter no less frequently than once per hour. Daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values shall be calculated from these hourly values and recorded.</P>

              <P>(D) Demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction that the proposed monitoring frequency is sufficient to represent control or recovery device operating conditions, considering typical variability of the specific process and control or recovery device operating parameter being monitored.</P>
              <P>(3) An owner or operator may request approval to use an automated data compression recording system that does not record monitored operating parameter values at a set frequency, but records all values that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded values, in accordance with paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (g)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The requested system shall be designed to:</P>
              <P>(A) Measure the operating parameter value at least once during every 15 minute period;</P>

              <P>(4) An owner or operator may request approval to use other alternative monitoring systems according to the procedures specified in § 63.8(f)(4).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reduced recordkeeping program.</E> For any parameter with respect to any item of equipment, the owner or operator may implement the recordkeeping requirements specified in paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section as alternatives to the continuous operating parameter monitoring and recordkeeping provisions that would otherwise apply under this subpart. The owner or operator shall retain for a period of 5 years each record required by paragraph (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator may retain only the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value, and is not required to retain more frequent monitored operating parameter values, for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment, if the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(vi) of this section are met. An owner or operator electing to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall notify the Administrator in the Notification of Compliance Status as specified in paragraph (e)(5)(xi) of this section or, if the Notification of Compliance Status has already been submitted, in the Periodic Report immediately preceding implementation of the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section as specified in paragraph (e)(6)(ix) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unrealistic or impossible data during periods of operation (e.g., a temperature reading of −200 °C on a boiler), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.</P>
              <P>(ii) The monitoring system generates, updated at least hourly throughout each operating day, a running average of the monitoring values that have been obtained during that operating day, and the capability to observe this running average is readily available to the Administrator on-site during the operating day. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the criteria in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section. All instances in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.</P>
              <P>(A) The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum established limits; and</P>
              <P>(B) The running average is based on at least six 1-hour average values.</P>
              <P>(iii) The monitoring system is capable of detecting unchanging data during periods of operation, except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (e.g., pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. All instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.</P>
              <P>(iv) The monitoring system will alert the owner or operator by an alarm or other means, if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately related to the established limit for the parameter that is being monitored.</P>
              <P>(v) The owner or operator shall verify the proper functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, at the times specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(v)(A) through (h)(1)(v)(C). The owner or operator shall document that the required verifications occurred.</P>
              <P>(A) Upon initial installation.</P>
              <P>(B) Annually after initial installation.</P>
              <P>(C) After any change to the programming or equipment constituting the monitoring system, which might reasonably be expected to alter the monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) The owner or operator shall retain the records identified in paragraphs (h)(1)(vi)(A) through (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Identification of each parameter, for each item of equipment, for which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.</P>

              <P>(B) A description of the applicable monitoring system(s), and of how compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) <PRTPAGE P="392"/>through (h)(1)(v) of this section. The description shall identify the location and format (e.g., on-line storage, log entries) for each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator shall retain both the current and the most recent superseded description, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) A description, and the date, of any change to the monitoring system that would reasonably be expected to impair its ability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(D) Owners and operators subject to paragraph (h)(1)(vi)(B) of this section shall retain the current description of the monitoring system as long as the description is current. The current description shall, at all times, be retained on-site or be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The owner or operator shall retain all superseded descriptions for at least 5 years after the date of their creation. Superseded descriptions shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request) for at least 6 months after their creation. Thereafter, superseded descriptions may be stored off-site.</P>
              <P>(2) If an owner or operator has elected to implement the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a monitored parameter with respect to an item of equipment and a period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator is no longer required to record the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value for any operating day when the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value is less than the maximum or greater than the minimum established limit. With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period of 6 consecutive months, if the parameter limit and the monitoring accomplished during the period prior to the compliance date was required and/or approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(i) If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report as specified in paragraph (e)(6)(x) of this section. The notification shall identify the parameter and unit of equipment.</P>
              <P>(ii) If, on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased recording daily average (or batch cycle daily average) values as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value for each operating day and shall notify the Administrator in the next Periodic Report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain each daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value until another period of 6 consecutive months has passed without an excursion as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, for the duration specified in this paragraph (h). For any calendar week, if compliance with paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does not result in retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one parameter value during a period of operation.</P>
              <P>(iv) For purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, an excursion means that the daily average (or batch cycle daily average) value of monitoring data for a parameter is greater than the maximum, or less than the minimum established value.</P>

The period of a rolling average stipulates the frequency of data averaging and reporting. To demonstrate compliance with an operating parameter a 30-day rolling average period requires calculation of a new average value each operating day and shall include the average of all the hourly averages of the specific operating parameter. For demonstration of compliance with an emissions limit based on pollutant concentration a 30-day rolling average is comprised of the average of all the hourly average concentrations over the previous 30 operating days. For demonstration of compliance with an emissions limit based on lbs-pollutant per production unit the 30-day rolling average is calculated by summing the hourly mass emissions over the previous 30 operating days, then dividing that sum by the total production during the same period.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The provisions in this section apply to each kiln and any alkali bypass associated with that kiln, clinker cooler, raw material dryer, and open clinker storage pile. All D/F, HCl, and total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions limit are on a dry basis. The D/F, HCl, and THC limits for kilns are corrected to 7 percent oxygen. All THC emissions limits are measured as propane. Standards for mercury and THC are based on a rolling 30-day average. If using a CEMS to determine compliance with the HCl standard, this standard is based on a rolling 30-day average. You must ensure appropriate corrections for moisture are made when measuring flow rates used to calculate mercury emissions. The 30-day period means all operating hours within 30 consecutive kiln operating days excluding periods of startup and shutdown. All emissions limits for kilns, clinker coolers, and raw material dryers currently in effect that are superseded by the limits below continue to apply until the compliance date of the limits below, or until the source certifies compliance with the limits below, whichever is earlier.</P>

                <P>(ii) Maintain the minimum activated carbon injection carrier gas pressure drop, as a rolling three-hour average, based on the manufacturer's specifications. These specifications must be documented in the test plan developed in accordance with § 63.7(c).</P>
                <P>(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, for an affected source subject to a D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343 that employs carbon injection as an emission control technique you must specify and use the brand and type of sorbent used during the performance test until a subsequent performance test is conducted, unless the site-specific performance test plan contains documentation of key parameters that affect adsorption and the owner or operator establishes limits based on those parameters, and the limits on these parameters are maintained.</P>
                <P>(e) For an affected source subject to a D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343 that employs carbon injection as an emission control technique you may substitute, at any time, a different brand or type of sorbent provided that the replacement has equivalent or improved properties compared to the sorbent specified in the site-specific performance test plan and used in the performance test. The owner or operator must maintain documentation that the substitute sorbent will provide the same or better level of control as the original sorbent.</P>

                <P>(f) No kiln may use as a raw material or fuel any fly ash where the mercury content of the fly ash has been increased through the use of activated carbon, or any other sorbent, unless the facility can demonstrate that the use of that fly ash will not result in an increase in mercury emissions over baseline emissions (i.e., emissions not using the fly ash). The facility has the burden of proving there has been no emissions increase over baseline. Once the kiln is in compliance with a mercury emissions limit specified in § 63.1343, this paragraph no longer applies.<PRTPAGE P="409"/>

                  <P>The first day of the 30 operating day performance test is the first day after the compliance date following completion of the field testing and data collection that demonstrates that the CPMS or CEMS has satisfied the relevant CPMS performance evaluation or CEMS performance specification (e.g., PS 2, 12A, or 12B) acceptance criteria. The performance test period is complete at the end of the 30th consecutive operating day. See § 63.1341 for definition of operating day and § 63.1348(b)(1) for the CEMS operating requirements. The source has the option of performing the compliance test earlier then the compliance date if desired.</P>

                <P>(3) <E T="03">D/F compliance.</E> (i) If you are subject to limitations on D/F emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate initial compliance with the D/F emissions standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(3). The owner or operator of a kiln with an in-line raw mill must demonstrate initial compliance by conducting separate performance tests while the raw mill is operating and the raw mill is not operating. Determine the D/F TEQ concentration for each run and calculate the arithmetic average of the TEQ concentrations measured for the three runs to determine continuous compliance.entrations measured for the three runs to determine continuous compliance.</P>
                <P>(ii) If you are subject to a D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance with the temperature operating limits specified in § 63.1346 by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(iv). Use the arithmetic average of the temperatures measured during the three runs to determine the applicable temperature limit.</P>
                <P>(iii) If activated carbon injection is used and you are subject to a D/F emissions limitation under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance with the activated carbon injection rate operating limits specified in § 63.1346 by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(3)(v).</P>
                <P>(iv) If activated carbon injection is used, you must also develop a carrier gas parameter (either the carrier gas flow rate or the carrier gas pressure drop) during the initial performance test and updated during any subsequent performance test conducted under § 63.1349(b)(3) that meets the requirements of § 63.1349(b)(3)(vi). Compliance is demonstrated if the system is maintained within ±5 percent accuracy during the performance test determined in accordance with the procedures and criteria submitted for review in your monitoring plan required in § 63.1350(p).</P>
                <P>(4)(i) <E T="03">THC Compliance.</E> If you are subject to limitations on THC emissions under § 63.1343(b), you must demonstrate compliance with the THC emissions standards by using the performance test methods and procedures in § 63.1349(b)(4)(i). You must use the average THC concentration obtained during the first 30 kiln operating days after the compliance date of this rule to determine initial compliance.</P>

                <P>(v) The time weighted average THC concentration measured during the initial performance test specified by § 63.1349(b)(4) must be used to determine the site-specific THC limit. Using the fraction of time the inline kiln/raw mill is on and the fraction of time that the inline kiln/raw mill is off, calculate this limit as a time weighted average of the THC levels measured during raw mill on and raw mill off testing using one of the two approaches in § 63.1349(b)(7)(vii) or (viii) depending on the level of organic HAP measured during the compliance test.</P>

Calculate the 30 kiln operating day emissions rate value using the assigned hourly Hg emissions concentrations and the respective flow and production rate values collected during the 30 kiln operating day performance test period. Depending on the duration of each integrated sampling period, you may not be able to calculate the 30 kiln operating day emissions value until several days after the end of the 30 kiln operating day performance test period.</P>
                <P>(ii) For example, a sorbent trap monitoring system producing an integrated 7-day sample will provide Hg concentration data for each hour of the first 28 kiln operating days (i.e., four values spanning 7 days each) of a 30 operating day period. The Hg concentration values for the hours of the last 2 days of the 30 operating day period will not be available for calculating the emissions for the performance test period until at least five days after the end of the subject period.</P>

                <P>(7) <E T="03">Commingled Exhaust Requirements.</E> If the coal mill exhaust is commingled with kiln exhaust in a single stack, you may demonstrate compliance with the kiln emission limits by either:</P>
                <P>(i) Performing required emissions monitoring and testing on the commingled coal mill and kiln exhaust, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Perform required emission monitoring and testing of the kiln exhaust prior to the reintroduction of the coal mill exhaust, and also testing the kiln exhaust diverted to the coal mill. All emissions must be added together for all emission points, and must not exceed the limit per each pollutant as listed in § 63.1343(b).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuous Monitoring Requirements.</E> You must demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the performance test methods and procedures in §§ 63.1350 and 63.8 for each affected source.</P>

                <P>(iii) You may not use data recorded during monitoring system startup, <PRTPAGE P="412"/>shutdown or malfunctions or repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Clinker Production.</E> If you are subject to limitations on mercury emissions (lb/MM tons of clinker) under § 63.1343(b), you must determine the hourly production rate of clinker according to the requirements of § 63.1350(d).</P>

As described in § 63.7(c)(2)(i), you must make available to the Administrator prior to testing, if requested, the site-specific test plan to be followed during performance testing. For purposes of determining exhaust gas flow rate to the atmosphere from an alkali bypass stack or a coal mill stack, you must either install, operate, calibrate and maintain an instrument for continuously measuring and recording the exhaust gas flow rate according to the requirements in paragraphs § 63.1350(n)(1) through (10) of this subpart or use the maximum design exhaust gas flow rate. For purposes of determining the combined emissions from kilns equipped with an alkali bypass or that exhaust kiln gases to a coal mill that exhausts through a separate stack, instead of installing a CEMS on the alkali bypass stack or coal mill stack, you may use the results of the initial and subsequent performance test to demonstrate compliance with the relevant emissions limit.</P>

                <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">PM emissions tests.</E> The owner or operator of a kiln and clinker cooler subject to limitations on PM emissions shall demonstrate initial compliance by conducting a performance test using Method 5 or Method 5I at appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter. You must also monitor continuous performance through use of a PM continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS).</P>
                <P>(i) For your PM CPMS, you will establish a site-specific operating limit. If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp or digital equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test to establish your operating limit. You will use the PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous compliance with your operating limit. You must repeat the performance test annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.</P>
                <P>(A) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp or digital signal output and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps or the monitors digital equivalent.</P>
                <P>(B) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to three times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to three times your allowable emission limit.</P>

                <P>(C) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp or digital output values from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> average all your PM CPMS output values for three corresponding Method 5I test runs).</P>

                <P>(ii) Determine your operating limit as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) through (iv) of this section. If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, <PRTPAGE P="415"/>the milliamp or digital equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test to establish your operating limit. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test. You must repeat the performance test at least annually and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the average of your three Method 5 or 5I compliance test runs is below 75 percent of your PM emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 or 5I compliance test with the procedures in (b)(1)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section.</P>
                <P>(A) Determine your PM CPMS instrument zero output with one of the following procedures:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The zero point may also be established by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> when your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If none of the steps in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.</P>
                <P>(B) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average in milliamps or digital equivalent, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs, using equation 3.</P>

                <P>(v) As an alternative to paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, the owner or operator may demonstrate initial compliance by conducting a performance test using Method 321 of appendix A to this part. You must also monitor continuous performance through use of an HCl CPMS according to paragraphs (b)(6)(v)(A) through (H) of this section. For kilns with inline raw mills, compliance testing and monitoring HCl to establish the site specific operating limit must be conducted during both raw mill on and raw mill off conditions.</P>

                <P>(A) For your HCl CPMS, you must establish a 30 kiln operating day site-specific operating limit. If your HCl performance test demonstrates your HCl emission levels to be less than 75 percent of your emission limit (2.25 ppmvd @7% O<E T="52">2</E>), you must use the time weighted average HCl CPMS indicated value recorded during the HCl compliance test (typically measured as ppmvw HCl at stack O<E T="52">2</E> concentration, but a dry, oxygen corrected value would also suffice), your HCl instrument zero output value, and the time weighted average HCl result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. If your HCl compliance test demonstrates your HCl emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit (2.25 ppmvd @7% O<E T="52">2</E>), you must use the time weighted average HCl CPMS indicated value recorded during the HCl compliance test as your operating limit. You must use the HCl CPMS indicated signal data to demonstrate continuous compliance with your operating limit.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Your HCl CPMS must provide a ppm HCl concentration output and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of indicated ppm. The instrument signal may be in ppmvw or ppmvd and the signal may be a measurement of HCl at in-stack concentration or a corrected oxygen concentration. Once the relationship between the indicated output of the HCl CPMS and the reference method test results is established, the HCl CPMS instrument measurement basis (ppmvw or ppmvd, or oxygen correction basis) must not be altered. Likewise, any setting that impacts the HCl CPMS indicated HCl response must remain fixed after the site-specific operating limit is set.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Your HCl CPMS operating range must be capable of reading HCl concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to 125 percent of the highest expected value during mill off operation. If your HCl CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading an indicated HCl concentration from zero to 10 ppm.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) During the initial performance test of a kiln with an inline raw mill, or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance <PRTPAGE P="421"/>with the HCl limit, record and average the indicated ppm HCl output values from the HCl CPMS for each of the six periods corresponding to the compliance test runs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> average each of your HCl CPMS output values for six corresponding Method 321 test runs). With the average values of the six test runs, calculate the average of the three mill on test runs and the average of the three mill off test runs. Calculate the time weighted result using the average of the three mill on tests and the average of the three mill off tests and the previous annual ratio of mill on/mill off operations. Kilns without an inline raw mill will conduct three compliance tests and calculate the average monitor output values corresponding to these three test runs and not use time weighted values to determine their site specific operating limit.</P>
                <P>(B) Determine your operating limit as specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) or (iii) of this section. If your HCl performance test demonstrates your HCl emission levels to be below 75 percent of your emission limit, kilns with inline raw mills will use the time weighted average indicated HCl ppm concentration CPMS value recorded during the HCl compliance test, the zero value output from your HCl CPMS, and the time weighted average HCl result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. Kilns without inline raw mills will not use a time weighted average value to establish their operating limit. If your time weighted HCl compliance test demonstrates your HCl emission levels to be at or above 75 percent of your emission limit, you will use the time weighted HCl CPMS indicated ppm value recorded during the HCl compliance test to establish your operating limit. Kilns without inline raw mills will not use time weighted compliance test results to make this determination. You must verify an existing operating limit or establish a new operating limit for each kiln, after each repeated performance test.</P>

                <P>(7) <E T="03">Total Organic HAP Emissions Tests.</E> Instead of conducting the performance test specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, you may conduct a performance test to determine emissions of total organic HAP by following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) Use Method 320 of appendix A to this part, Method 18 of Appendix A of part 60, ASTM D6348-03 or a combination to determine emissions of total organic HAP. Each performance test must consist of three separate runs under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating at the representative performance conditions in accordance with § 63.7(e). Each run must be conducted for at least 1 hour.</P>
                <P>(ii) At the same time that you are conducting the performance test for total organic HAP, you must also determine a site-specific THC emissions limit by operating a THC CEMS in accordance with the requirements of § 63.1350(j). The duration of the performance test must be at least 3 hours and the average THC concentration (as calculated from the recorded output) during the 3-hour test must be calculated. You must establish your THC operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (b)(7)(vii) and (viii) of this section. It is permissible to extend the testing time of the organic HAP performance test if you believe extended testing is required to adequately capture organic HAP and/or THC variability over time.</P>
                <P>(iii) If your source has an in-line kiln/raw mill you must use the fraction of time the raw mill is on and the fraction of time that the raw mill is off and calculate this limit as a weighted average of the THC levels measured during three raw mill on and three raw mill off tests.</P>
                <P>(iv) If your organic HAP emissions are below 75 percent of the organic HAP standard and you determine your operating limit with paragraph (b)(7)(vii) of this section your THC CEMS must be calibrated and operated on a measurement scale no greater than 180 ppmvw, as carbon, or 60 ppmvw as propane.</P>
                <P>(v) If your kiln has an inline coal mill and/or an alkali bypass with separate stacks, you are required to measure and account for oHAP emissions from their separate stacks. You are required to measure oHAP at the coal mill inlet or outlet and you must also measure oHAP at the alkali bypass outlet. You must then calculate a flow weighted average oHAP concentration for all emission sources including the inline coal mill and the alkali bypass.</P>

                <P>(vi) Your THC CEMS measurement scale must be capable of reading THC concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to two times your highest THC emissions average determined during your performance test, including mill on or mill off operation. <E T="02">Note:</E> This may require the use of a dual range instrument to meet this requirement and paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(vii) Determine your operating limit as specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(viii) and (ix) of this section. If your organic HAP performance test demonstrates your average organic HAP emission levels are below 75 percent of your emission limit (9 ppmv) you will use the average THC value recorded during the organic HAP performance test, and the average total organic HAP result of your performance test to establish your operating limit. If your organic HAP compliance test results demonstrate that your average organic HAP emission levels are at or above 75 percent of your emission limit, your operating limit is established as the average THC value recorded during the organic HAP performance test. You must establish a new operating limit after each performance test. You must repeat the performance test no later than 30 months following your last performance test and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.</P>

                <P>(viii) If the average organic HAP results for your three Method 18 and/or Method 320 performance test runs are <PRTPAGE P="425"/>below 75 percent of your organic HAP emission limit, you must calculate an operating limit by establishing a relationship of THC CEMS signal to the organic HAP concentration using the average THC CEMS value corresponding to the three organic HAP compliance test runs and the average organic HAP total concentration from the Method 18 and/or Method 320 performance test runs with the procedures in (b)(7)(viii)(A) and (B) of this section.</P>

You must establish an SO<E T="52">2</E> operating limit equal to the average recorded during the HCl stack test. This operating limit will <PRTPAGE P="427"/>apply only for demonstrating HCl compliance.</P>
                <P>(i) Use Method 321 of appendix A to this part to determine emissions of HCl. Each performance test must consist of three separate runs under the conditions that exist when the affected source is operating at the representative performance conditions in accordance with § 63.7(e). Each run must be conducted for at least one hour.</P>

                <P>(ii) At the same time that you are conducting the performance test for HCl, you must also determine a site-specific SO<E T="52">2</E> emissions limit by operating an SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS in accordance with the requirements of § 63.1350(l). The duration of the performance test must be three hours and the average SO<E T="52">2</E> concentration (as calculated from the average output) during the 3-hour test must be calculated. You must establish your SO<E T="52">2</E> operating limit and determine compliance with it according to paragraphs (b)(8)(vii) and (viii) of this section.</P>

                <P>(iii) If your source has an in-line kiln/raw mill you must use the fraction of time the raw mill is on and the fraction of time that the raw mill is off and calculate this limit as a weighted average of the SO<E T="52">2</E> levels measured during raw mill on and raw mill off testing.</P>
                <P>(iv) Your SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS must be calibrated and operated according to the requirements of § 60.63(f).</P>
                <P>(v) Your SO<E T="52">2</E> CEMS measurement scale must be capable of reading SO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations consistent with the requirements of § 60.63(f), including mill on or mill off operation.</P>

                <P>(vi) If your kiln has an inline kiln/raw mill, you must conduct separate performance tests while the raw mill is operating (“mill on”) and while the raw mill is not operating (“mill off”). Using the fraction of time the raw mill is on and the fraction of time that the raw mill is off, calculate this limit as a weighted average of the SO<E T="52">2</E> levels measured during raw mill on and raw mill off compliance testing with Equation 17.</P>

You must monitor mercury continuously according to paragraphs (k)(1) through (5) of this section. You must also develop an emissions monitoring plan in accordance with paragraphs (p)(1) through (4) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) You must use a span value for any Hg CEMS that represents the mercury concentration corresponding to approximately two times the emissions standard and may be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5 µg/m<SU>3</SU> of total mercury or higher level if necessary to include Hg concentrations which may occur (excluding concentrations during in-line raw “mill off” operation). As specified in PS 12A, Section 6.1.1, the data recorder output range must include the full range of expected Hg concentration values which would include those expected during “mill off” conditions. Engineering judgments made and calculations used to determine the corresponding span concentration from the emission standard shall be documented in the site-specific monitoring plan and associated records.</P>
                <P>(2) In order to quality assure data measured above the span value, you must use one of the four options in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) Include a second span that encompasses the Hg emission concentrations expected to be encountered during “mill off” conditions.

                <P>(ii) Quality assure any data above the span value by proving instrument linearity beyond the span value established in paragraph (k)(1) of this section using the following procedure. Conduct a weekly “above span linearity” calibration challenge of the monitoring system using a reference gas with a certified value greater than your highest expected hourly concentration or greater than 75 percent of <PRTPAGE P="434"/>the highest measured hourly concentration. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of PS 12A, Section 7.1 and must be introduced to the measurement system at the probe. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The “above span linearity” challenge is successful if the value measured by the Hg CEMS falls within 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the Hg CEMS during the above span linearity challenge exceeds ±10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, the monitoring system must be evaluated and repaired and a new “above span linearity” challenge met before returning the Hg CEMS to service, or data above span from the Hg CEMS must be subject to the quality assurance procedures established in paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section. In this manner all hourly average values exceeding the span value measured by the Hg CEMS during the week following the above span linearity challenge when the CEMS response exceeds ±20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas must be normalized using Equation 22.</P>

Any time two consecutive 1-hour average measured concentrations of Hg exceeds the span value you must, within 24 hours before or after, introduce a higher, “above span” Hg reference gas standard to the Hg CEMS. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of PS 12A, Section 7.1, must target a concentration level between 50 and 150 percent of the highest expected hourly concentration measured during the period of measurements above span, and must be introduced at the probe. While this target represents a desired concentration range that is not always achievable in practice, it is expected that the intent to meet this range is demonstrated by the value of the reference gas. Expected values may include “above span” calibrations done before or after the above span measurement period. Record and report the results of this procedure as you would for a daily calibration. The “above span” calibration is successful if the value measured by the Hg CEMS is within 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the Hg CEMS exceeds 20 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, then you must normalize the one-hour average stack gas values measured above the span during the 24-hour period preceding or following the “above span” calibration for reporting based on the Hg CEMS response to the reference gas as shown in Equation 22. Only one “above span” calibration is needed per 24-hour period.</P>

                <P>(i) Develop a mercury hourly mass emissions rate by conducting performance tests annually, within 11 to 13 calendar months after the previous performance test, using Method 29, or Method 30B, to measure the concentration of mercury in the gases exhausted from the alkali bypass and coal mill.</P>
                <P>(ii) On a continuous basis, determine the mass emissions of mercury in lb/hr from the alkali bypass and coal mill exhausts by using the mercury hourly emissions rate and the exhaust gas flow rate to calculate hourly mercury emissions in lb/hr.</P>
                <P>(iii) Sum the hourly mercury emissions from the kiln, alkali bypass and coal mill to determine total mercury emissions. Using hourly clinker production, calculate the hourly emissions rate in pounds per ton of clinker to determine your 30 day rolling average.</P>
                <P>(iv) If mercury emissions from the coal mill and alkali bypass are below the method detection limit for two consecutive annual performance tests, you may reduce the frequency of the performance tests of coal mills and alkali bypasses to once every 30 months. If the measured mercury concentration exceeds the method detection limit, you must revert to testing annually until two consecutive annual tests are below the method detection limit.</P>
                <P>(6) If you operate an integrated sorbent trap monitoring system conforming to PS 12B, you may use a monitoring period at least 24 hours but no longer than 168 hours in length.

You must operate, maintain, and quality assure a HCl CEMS installed and certified under PS 15 according to the quality assurance requirements in Procedure 1 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter except that the Relative Accuracy Test Audit requirements of Procedure 1 must be replaced with the validation requirements and criteria of sections 11.1.1 and 12.0 of PS 15. If you choose to install and operate an HCl CEMS in accordance with PS 18, you must operate, maintain, and quality assure the HCl CEMS using the associated Procedure 6 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter. For any performance specification that you use, you must use Method 321 of appendix A to this part as the reference test method for conducting relative accuracy testing.

                <P>(i) You must use a measurement span value for any HCl CEMS of 0-10 ppmvw unless the monitor is installed on a kiln without an inline raw mill. Kilns without an inline raw mill may use a higher span value sufficient to quantify all expected emissions concentrations.

                <P>(B) Quality assure any data above the span value by proving instrument linearity beyond the span value established in paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section using the following procedure. Conduct a weekly “above span linearity” calibration challenge of the monitoring system using a reference gas with a certified value greater than your highest expected hourly concentration or greater than 75 percent of the highest measured hourly concentration. The “above span” reference gas must meet the requirements of the applicable performance specification and must be introduced to the measurement system at the probe.

The “above span linearity” challenge is successful if the value measured by the HCl CEMS falls within 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas. If the value measured by the HCl CEMS during the above span linearity challenge exceeds 10 percent of the certified value of the reference gas, the monitoring system must be evaluated and repaired and a new “above span linearity” challenge met before returning the HCl CEMS to service, or data above span from the HCl CEMS must be subject to the quality assurance procedures established in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(D) of this section.

                <P>(ii) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (<E T="03">e.g.</E> beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp signals corresponding to each PM compliance test run.</P>

                <P>(12) All reports required by this subpart not subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(9) introductory text and (b)(11)(i) of this section must be sent to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13. The Administrator or the delegated authority may request a report in any form suitable for the specific case (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by commonly used electronic media such as Excel spreadsheet, on CD or hard copy). The Administrator retains the right to require submittal of reports subject to paragraphs (b)(9) introductory text and (b)(11)(i) of this section in paper format.</P>
                <P>(c) For each failure to meet a standard or emissions limit caused by a malfunction at an affected source, you must report the failure in the semi-annual compliance report required by § 63.1354(b)(9). The report must contain the date, time and duration, and the cause of each event (including unknown cause, if applicable), and a sum of the number of events in the reporting period. The report must list for each event the affected source or equipment, an estimate of the amount of each regulated pollutant emitted over the emission limit for which the source failed to meet a standard, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions. The report must also include a description of actions taken by an owner or operator during a malfunction of an affected source to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.1348(d), including actions taken to correct a malfunction.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition of affected source.</E> The affected source subject to this subpart is the facility-wide collection of pesticide active ingredient manufacturing process units (PAI process units) that process, use, or produce HAP, and are located at a plant site that is a major source, as defined in section 112(a) of the CAA. An affected source also includes waste management units, heat exchange systems, and cooling towers that are associated with the PAI process units. Exemptions from an affected source are specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">New source applicability.</E> A new affected source subject to this subpart and to which the requirements for new sources apply is defined according to the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) An affected source for which construction or reconstruction commenced after November 10, 1997.</P>
              <P>(2) Any dedicated PAI process unit that meets the criteria specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) For which construction, as defined in § 63.1361, commenced after November 10, 1997, or reconstruction commenced after September 20, 2002.</P>
              <P>(ii) That has the potential to emit 10 tons/yr of any one HAP or 25 tons/yr of combined HAP.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply to an owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart, and clarifies specific provisions in subpart A of this part as necessary for this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemptions from the requirements of this subpart.</E> The provisions of this subpart do not apply to:</P>
              <P>(1) Research and development facilities;</P>
              <P>(2) PAI process units that are subject to subpart F of this part;</P>
              <P>(3) Production of ethylene;</P>
              <P>(4) Coal tar distillation; and</P>
              <P>(5) The following emission points listed:</P>
              <P>(i) Storm water from segregated sewers;</P>
              <P>(ii) Water from fire-fighting and deluge systems, including testing of such systems;</P>
              <P>(iii) Spills;</P>
              <P>(iv) Water from safety showers;</P>
              <P>(v) Noncontact steam boiler blowdown and condensate;</P>
              <P>(vi) Laundry water;</P>
              <P>(vii) Vessels storing material that contains no organic HAP or contains organic HAP as impurities only; and</P>
              <P>(viii) Equipment, as defined in § 63.1363, that is intended to operate in organic HAP service for less than 300 hours during the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Applicability of this subpart.</E> (1) Each provision set forth in this subpart shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(i) The startup, shutdown, or malfunction precludes the ability of the owner or operator of an affected source to comply with one or more specific emission limitations to which a particular emission point is subject; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator follows the provisions for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, as specified in §§ 63.1367(a)(3) and 63.1368(i).</P>
              <P>(2) The provisions set forth in § 63.1363 shall apply at all times except during periods of nonoperation of the PAI process unit (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in the cessation of the emissions to which § 63.1363 applies.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with the emissions limitations of this subpart during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment, if the shutdown would contravene emissions limitations of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">General duty.</E> At all times, the owner or operator must operate and <PRTPAGE P="450"/>maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Storage vessel applicability determination.</E> An owner or operator shall follow the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section to determine whether a storage vessel is part of the affected source to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 CFR part 63 on June 23, 1999, the storage vessel shall belong to the process unit subject to the other subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Unless otherwise excluded under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the storage vessel is part of a PAI process unit if either the input to the vessel from the PAI process unit is greater than or equal to the input from any other PAI or non-PAI process unit, or the output from the vessel to the PAI process unit is greater than or equal to the output to any other PAI or non-PAI process unit. If the greatest input to and/or output from a shared storage vessel is the same for two or more process units, including one or more PAI process units, the owner or operator must assign the storage vessel to any one of the PAI process units that meet this condition.</P>
              <P>(3) Unless otherwise excluded under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, where a storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The storage vessel in the tank farm is not subject to the provisions of this subpart if the greatest input to or output from the storage vessel is for a non-PAI process unit. The input and output shall be determined among only those process units that share the storage vessel and that do not have an intervening storage vessel for that product (or raw material, as appropriate).</P>
              <P>(ii) Except for storage vessels in a tank farm excluded in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Except as specified in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel in a tank farm if each PAI process unit that receives material from or sends material to the storage vessel has an intervening storage vessel for that material.</P>

An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process or part of a process for less than 24 hours is not a process shutdown. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that would stop production from a process or part of a process for a shorter period of time than would be required to clear the process or part of the process of materials and start up the process, and would result in greater emissions than delay of repair of leaking components until the next scheduled process shutdown, is not a process shutdown.

              <P>(6) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990 may not be used to generate emissions averaging credits, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990. In these cases, credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Performance test requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall conduct a performance test to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits in § 63.1382. Compliance is demonstrated when the emission rate of the pollutant is equal to or less than each of the applicable emission limits in § 63.1382. The owner or operator shall conduct the performance test according to the procedures in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A and in this section. If the owner or operator conducted an emissions test in 2016 according to the procedures specified in § 63.1384(a)(9) and § 63.1385 in response to the EPA's Information Collection Request, the owner or operator can use the results of the emissions test to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits for rotary spin lines specified in Table 2 to this subpart.</P>

              <P>(1) All monitoring systems and equipment must be installed, operational, and calibrated prior to the performance test.<PRTPAGE P="541"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Unless a different frequency is specified in this section, the owner or operator must monitor and record process and/or add-on control device parameters at least every 15 minutes during the performance tests. The arithmetic average for each parameter must be calculated using all of the recorded measurements for the parameter.</P>
              <P>(3) During each performance test, the owner or operator must monitor and record the glass pull rate for each glass-melting furnace and, if different, the glass pull rate for each rotary spin manufacturing line and flame attenuation manufacturing line. Record the glass pull rate every 15 minutes during any performance test required by this subpart and determine the arithmetic average of the recorded measurements for each test run and calculate the average of the three test runs. If a rotary spin or flame attenuation line shares one or more emissions points with another rotary spin or flame attenuation line(s), owners or operators can conduct the performance test while each of the process lines with the shared emissions point(s) is operating as specified in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, rather than testing each of the shared lines separately. In these cases, owners or operators must use the combined glass pull rate for the process lines with the shared emissions point(s) to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits specified in Table 2 to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator shall conduct a performance test for each existing and new gas-fired glass-melting furnace. During the performance test of each gas-fired glass-melting furnace, the owner or operator must measure and record the materials mix, including the percentages of raw materials and cullet, melted in the furnace during the performance test.</P>
              <P>(5) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a glass-melting furnace controlled by an ESP shall monitor and record the ESP parameter level(s), as specified in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan, and establish the minimum and/or maximum value(s) that will be used to demonstrate compliance after the initial performance test.</P>
              <P>(6) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a cold top electric furnace that is not equipped with an add-on control device for PM emissions control, must monitor and record the temperature 46 to 61 centimeters (18 to 24 inches) above the molten glass surface to ensure that the maximum temperature does not exceed 120 °C (250 °F).</P>
              <P>(7) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a glass melting furnace (other than a cold top electric furnace) that is not equipped with an add-on control device for PM emissions control, must monitor and record the furnace parameter level, and establish the minimum and/or maximum value(s) that will be used to demonstrate compliance after the initial performance test.</P>
              <P>(8) The owner or operator must conduct a performance test for each rotary spin manufacturing line, subject to this subpart, while producing the building insulation with the highest LOI expected to be produced on that line; and for each flame attenuation manufacturing line, subject to this subpart, while producing the heavy-density product or pipe product with the highest LOI expected to be produced on the affected line.</P>
              <P>(9) The owner or operator of each rotary spin manufacturing line and flame attenuation manufacturing line regulated by this subpart must conduct performance tests using the resin with the highest free-formaldehyde content. During the performance test of each rotary spin manufacturing line and flame attenuation manufacturing line regulated by this subpart, the owner or operator shall monitor and record the free-formaldehyde and free-phenol contents of the resin, the binder formulation used, and the product LOI and density.</P>

              <P>(10) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a rotary spin manufacturing line or flame attenuation manufacturing line who plans to use process modifications to comply with the emission limits in § 63.1382 must monitor and record the process parameter level(s), as specified in the operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan, which will be used to demonstrate compliance after the initial performance test.<PRTPAGE P="542"/>
              </P>
              <P>(11) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a rotary spin manufacturing line or flame attenuation manufacturing line who plans to use a wet scrubbing control device to comply with the emission limits in § 63.1382 must continuously monitor and record the pressure drop across the scrubber, the scrubbing liquid flow rate, and addition of any chemical to the scrubber, including the chemical feed rate, and establish the minimum and/or maximum value(s) that will be used to determine compliance after the initial performance test.</P>
              <P>(12) During the performance test, the owner or operator of a rotary spin manufacturing line or affected flame attenuation manufacturing line shall continuously record the operating temperature of each incinerator and record the average during each 1-hour test; the average operating temperature of the three 1-hour tests shall be used to monitor compliance.</P>
              <P>(13) Unless disapproved by the Administrator, an owner or operator of a rotary spin or flame attenuation manufacturing line regulated by this subpart may conduct short-term experimental production runs using binder formulations or other process modifications where the process parameter values would be outside those established during performance tests without first conducting performance tests. Such runs must not exceed 1 week in duration unless the Administrator approves a longer period. The owner or operator must notify the Administrator and postmark or deliver the notification at least 15 days prior to commencement of the short-term experimental production runs. The Administrator must inform the owner or operator of a decision to disapprove or must request additional information prior to the date of the short-term experimental production runs. Notification of intent to perform an experimental short-term production run shall include the following information:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Startups and shutdowns.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions set forth in this subpart apply at all times.</P>
              <P>(b) You must not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with the provisions of this subpart during times when emissions are being, or are otherwise required to be, routed to such items of equipment.</P>
              <P>(c) Startup begins when the wool fiberglass glass-melting furnace has any raw materials added and reaches 50 percent of its typical operating temperature. Startup ends when molten glass begins to flow from the wool fiberglass glass-melting furnace. For cold-top electric furnaces, startup ends when the batch cover is established and the temperature of the glass batch-cover surface is below 300 °F.</P>
              <P>(d) Shutdown begins when the heat sources to the glass-melting furnace are reduced to begin the glass-melting furnace shut down process. Shutdown ends when the glass-melting furnace is empty or the contents are sufficiently viscous to preclude glass flow from the glass-melting furnace.</P>
              <P>(e) During periods of startup and shutdown in a cold-top furnace that is routed to a baghouse during normal operation, you must establish the batch cover and operate your furnace according to the following requirements during startup and shutdown:</P>
              <P>(1) You must keep records showing that you used only natural gas or other clean fuels to heat each furnace; and</P>
              <P>(2) Except after batch cover is established, you must keep records showing that you used only cullet as a raw material during the startup of each cold-top furnace; and</P>
              <P>(3) Once a batch cover is established and a control device can be safely operated, you must keep records showing that furnace emissions were controlled using air pollution control devices operated at the parameters established by the most recent performance test that showed compliance with the standard.</P>
              <P>(4) During periods of shutdown in a cold-top furnace, until the conditions above the glass reach a point at which the control device may be damaged if it continues to operate, you must keep records showing furnace emissions were controlled using air pollution control devices operated at the parameters established by the most recent performance test that showed compliance with the standard.</P>
              <P>(f) During both periods of startups and shutdowns for all furnace types other than cold-top furnaces, you must operate each furnace according to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) You must record the type of fuel used to heat the furnace during startup and shutdown to demonstrate that you used only natural gas or other clean fuels; and</P>
              <P>(2) You must keep records showing that furnace emissions were controlled using air pollution control devices operated at the parameters established by the most recent performance test that showed compliance with the standard.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Subpart NNN of Part 63—Free Formaldehyde Analysis of Insulation Resins by Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. Scope</HD>
              <P>This method was specifically developed for water-soluble phenolic resins that have a relatively high free-formaldehyde (FF) content such as insulation resins. It may also be suitable for other phenolic resins, especially those with a high FF content.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Principle</HD>

              <P>2.1 a. The basis for this method is the titration of the hydrochloric acid that is liberated when hydroxylamine hydrochloride reacts with formaldehyde to form formaldoxine:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">HCHO + NH2OH:HCl → CH2:NOH + H2O + HCl</FP>
              
              <P>b. Free formaldehyde in phenolic resins is present as monomeric formaldehyde, hemiformals, polyoxymethylene hemiformals, and polyoxymethylene glycols. Monomeric formaldehyde and hemiformals react rapidly with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, but the polymeric forms of formaldehyde must hydrolyze to the monomeric state before they can react. The greater the concentration of free formaldehyde in a resin, the more of that formaldehyde will be in the polymeric form. The hydrolysis of these polymers is catalyzed by hydrogen ions.</P>
              <P>2.2 The resin sample being analyzed must contain enough free formaldehyde so that the initial reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride will produce sufficient hydrogen ions to catalyze the depolymerization of the polymeric formaldehyde within the time limits of the test method. The sample should contain approximately 0.3 grams free formaldehyde to ensure complete reaction within 5 minutes.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Apparatus</HD>
              <P>3.1 Balance, readable to 0.01 g or better.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Affected source.</E> The affected source is:</P>
              <P>(1) The total of all amino/phenolic resin process units (APPU);</P>
              <P>(2) The associated heat exchange systems;</P>
              <P>(3) Equipment required by, or utilized as a method of compliance with, this subpart which may include control devices and recovery devices;</P>
              <P>(4) Equipment that does not contain organic hazardous air pollutants (HAP) and is located within an APPU that is part of an affected source;</P>
              <P>(5) Vessels and equipment storing and/or handling material that contain no organic HAP and/or organic HAP as impurities only;</P>
              <P>(6) Equipment that is intended to operate in organic HAP service for less than 300 hours during the calendar year;</P>
              <P>(7) Each waste management unit; and</P>
              <P>(8) Maintenance wastewater.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Existing affected source.</E> The affected source to which the existing source provisions of this subpart apply is defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">New affected source.</E> The affected source to which the new source provisions of this subpart apply is:<PRTPAGE P="553"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Each affected source defined in paragraph (b) of this section that commences construction or reconstruction after December 14, 1998;</P>
              <P>(2) Each additional group of one or more APPU and associated heat exchange systems that has the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of any organic HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of organic HAP that commences construction after December 14, 1998; or</P>
              <P>(3) Each group of one or more process units and associated heat exchange systems that are converted to APPUs after December 14, 1998, that has the potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of any organic HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any combination of organic HAP.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">APPUs without organic HAP.</E> An APPU that is part of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, but that does not use or manufacture any organic HAP, is not subject to any other provisions of this subpart and is not required to comply with the provisions of subpart A of this part. When requested by the Administrator, the owner or operator shall demonstrate that the APPU does not use or manufacture any organic HAP. Types of information that could document this determination include, but are not limited to, records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exemption from equipment leak provisions.</E> Affected sources with actual annual production of amino/phenolic resin equal to or less than 800 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) for the 12-month period preceding December 14, 1998 are exempt from the equipment leak provisions specified in § 63.1410. The owner or operator utilizing this exemption shall recheck the actual annual production of amino/phenolic resins for each 12-month period following December 14, 1998. The beginning of each 12-month period shall be the anniversary of December 14, 1998. If the actual annual production of amino/phenolic resins is greater than 800 Mg/yr for any 12-month period, the owner or operator shall comply with § 63.1410 for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Primary product determination and applicability.</E> For purposes of this paragraph, amino resins and phenolic resins shall be considered to be the same product and production time or production mass of amino and phenolic resins shall be combined for purposes of determining the primary product under this paragraph (g). If the owner or operator determines that a process unit is not an APPU under paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section, the owner or operator shall, when requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the process unit is not an APPU.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Applicability determinations for process units producing multiple products.</E> A process unit that produces more than one intended product at the same time is an APPU if amino/phenolic resin production accounts for the greatest percent of the annual design capacity on a mass basis. If a process unit has the same annual design capacity on a mass basis for two or more products, the process unit shall be an APPU if amino/phenolic resins are one of those products.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Flexible operations process unit determination based on operating time.</E> A flexible operations process unit is an APPU if amino/phenolic resins will be produced for the greatest operating time over the 5 years following December 14, 1998 at existing process units, or for the first year after the process unit begins production of any product for new process units.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Flexible operations process unit determination based on mass production basis.</E> A flexible operations process unit that will manufacture multiple products equally based on operating time is an APPU if amino/phenolic resins account for the greatest percentage of the expected production on a mass basis over the 5 years following December 14, 1998 at existing process units, or for the first year after the process unit begins production of any product for new process units.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Flexible operations process unit default determination.</E> If the owner or operator cannot determine whether or not amino/phenolic resins are the primary product of a flexible operations <PRTPAGE P="554"/>process unit in accordance with paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section, the flexible operations process unit shall be designated as an APPU if amino/phenolic resins were produced for 5 percent or greater of the total operating time since December 14, 1998 for existing process units. The flexible operations process unit shall be designated as an APPU if the owner or operator anticipates that amino/phenolic resins will be manufactured in the flexible operations process unit at any time in the first year after the date the unit begins production of any product for new process units.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Annual applicability determination for non-APPUs that have produced amino/phenolic resins.</E> Once per year beginning December 14, 2003, the owner or operator of each flexible operations process unit that is not designated as an APPU, but that has produced amino/phenolic resins at any time in the preceding 5-year period or since the date that the unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall perform an evaluation to determine whether the process unit has become an APPU. A flexible operations process unit has become an APPU if amino/phenolic resins were produced for the greatest operating time over the preceding 5-year period or since the date that the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Applicability determination for non-APPUs that have not produced amino/phenolic resins.</E> The owner or operator that anticipates the production of amino/phenolic resins in a process unit that is not designated as an APPU, and in which no amino/phenolic resins have been produced in the previous 5-year period or since the date that the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter, shall determine if the process unit will become an APPU. The owner or operator shall use the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section to determine if the process unit is designated as an APPU, with the following exception: for existing process units, production shall be projected for the 5 years following the date that the owner or operator anticipates initiating the production of amino/phenolic resins, instead of the 5 years following December 14, 1998.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Redetermination of applicability to APPU that are flexible operations process units.</E> Whenever changes in production occur that could reasonably be expected to cause a flexible operations process unit to no longer be an APPU (i.e., amino/phenolic resins will no longer be the primary product according to the determination procedures in paragraphs (g)(2) through (4) of this section), the owner or operator shall reevaluate the status of the process unit as an APPU. A flexible operations process unit has ceased to be an APPU subject to this subpart if the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(i) If amino/phenolic resins were not produced for the greatest operating time over the preceding 5-year period or since the date that the process unit began production of any product, whichever is shorter;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the new primary product, which is not amino/phenolic resins, is subject to another subpart of this part; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If the owner or operator has notified the Administrator of the pending change in status for the flexible operations process unit, as specified in § 63.1417(h)(4).</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">APPU terminating production of all amino/phenolic resins.</E> If an APPU terminates the production of all amino/phenolic resins and does not anticipate the production of any amino/phenolic resins in the future, the process unit is no longer an APPU and is not subject to this subpart after notification is made to the Administrator, as specified in § 63.1417(h)(4).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Storage vessel applicability determination.</E> The owner or operator of a storage vessel at a new affected source shall determine assignment to a process unit as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of part 63 on January 20, 2000, said storage vessel shall continue to be assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.</P>

              <P>(3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the storage vessel <PRTPAGE P="555"/>shall be assigned to that process unit located on the same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into or output from the storage vessel (i.e., said process unit has the predominant use of the storage vessel).</P>
              <P>(4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units, and if one or more of those process units is an APPU subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be assigned to any of the APPUs.</P>
              <P>(5) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the use as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For existing affected sources, use shall be determined based on the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The year preceding January 20, 2000; or</P>
              <P>(B) The expected use for the 5 years following January 20, 2000.</P>
              <P>(ii) For new affected sources, use shall be determined based on the first 5 years after initial start-up.</P>
              <P>(7) Where the storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the assignment of the storage vessel shall be determined according to paragraphs (h)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section. Only those storage vessels where a portion or all of the input into or output from the storage vessel is hardpiped directly to one or more process units are covered by this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(i) The storage vessel is assigned to a process unit if the product or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm without passing through any intervening storage vessel. An intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel connected by hardpiping both to the process unit and to the storage vessel in the tank farm.</P>
              <P>(ii) If there are two or more process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (h)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units according to the provisions of paragraphs (h)(3) through (6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial determination, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) a process unit, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to the storage vessel according to the procedures in paragraphs (h)(3) through (7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Applicability of other subparts to this subpart.</E> Paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) describe the applicability of other subparts to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to and complying with the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, shall continue to comply with 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb. After the compliance dates specified in this section, a storage vessel that is assigned to an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, but the owner or operator has not been required to apply controls as part of complying with 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said storage vessel shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb.</P>
              <P>(2) Affected sources subject to this subpart that are also subject to the provisions of subpart Q of this part shall comply with both subparts.</P>
              <P>(3) After the compliance dates specified in this section, an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, or the provisions of subpart H of this part, is required to comply only with the provisions of this subpart. After the compliance dates specified in this section, said source shall no longer be subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV, or subpart H of this part, as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(4) After the applicable compliance date specified in this subpart, if a heat exchange system subject to this subpart is also subject to a standard identified in paragraph (i)(4)(i) or (ii) of <PRTPAGE P="556"/>this section, compliance with the applicable provisions of the standard identified in paragraph (i)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section shall constitute compliance with the applicable provisions of this subpart with respect to that heat exchange system.</P>
              <P>(i) Subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) A subpart of this part that requires compliance with § 63.104 (e.g., subpart U of this part).</P>
              <P>(5) After the compliance dates specified in this subpart, if any combustion device, recovery device or recapture device subject to this subpart is also subject to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, or CC, or is subject to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 265, subparts AA, BB, or CC, and the owner or operator complies with the periodic reporting requirements under 40 CFR part 264, subparts AA, BB, or CC, that would apply to the device if the facility had final-permitted status, the owner or operator may elect to comply either with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart, or with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, as described in this paragraph, which shall constitute compliance with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this subpart. If the owner or operator elects to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265, the owner or operator shall report all information required by § 63.1417(f), Periodic Reports, as part of complying with the requirements of 40 CFR parts 264 and/or 265.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Applicability of general provisions.</E> Table 1 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A of this part that apply and do not apply to owners and operators of affected sources subject to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Applicability of this subpart.</E> (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(2) The emission limitations set forth in 40 CFR part 63, subpart UU, as referred to in § 63.1410, shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which § 63.1410 applies.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during times when emissions are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">General duty.</E> At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</P>

Surrogate indicators that could be used to develop an acceptable monitoring program are ion specific electrode monitoring, pH, conductivity or other representative indicators.</P>

              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall prepare and implement a monitoring plan that documents the procedures that will be used to detect leaks of process fluids into cooling water. The plan shall require monitoring of one or more surrogate indicators or monitoring of one or more process parameters or other conditions that indicate a leak. Monitoring that is already being conducted for other purposes may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. The plan shall include the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="572"/>

              <P>(ii) The parameter level(s) or conditions(s) that constitute a leak. This shall be documented by data or calculations showing that the selected levels or conditions will reliably identify leaks. The monitoring must be sufficiently sensitive to determine the range of parameter levels or conditions when the system is not leaking. When the selected parameter level or condition is outside that range, a leak is indicated.</P>
              <P>(iii) The monitoring frequency which shall be no less frequent than monthly for the first 6 months and quarterly thereafter to detect leaks.</P>
              <P>(iv) The records that will be maintained to document compliance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If a substantial leak is identified by methods other than those described in the monitoring plan and the method(s) specified in the plan could not detect the leak, the owner or operator shall revise the plan and document the basis for the changes. The owner or operator shall complete the revisions to the plan no later than 180 days after discovery of the leak.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator shall maintain, at all times, the monitoring plan that is currently in use. The current plan shall be maintained on-site, or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. If the monitoring plan is superseded, the owner or operator shall retain the most recent superseded plan at least until 5 years from the date of its creation. The superseded plan shall be retained on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request) for at least 6 months after its creation.</P>
              <P>(d) If a leak is detected according to the criteria of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The leak shall be repaired as soon as practical but not later than 45 calendar days after the owner or operator receives results of monitoring tests indicating a leak. The leak shall be repaired unless the owner or operator demonstrates that the results are due to a condition other than a leak.</P>
              <P>(2) Once the leak has been repaired, the owner or operator shall confirm that the heat exchange system has been repaired within 7 calendar days of the repair or startup, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(e) Delay of repair of heat exchange systems for which leaks have been detected is allowed if the equipment is isolated from the process. Delay of repair is also allowed if repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and any one of the conditions in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section are met. All time periods in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section shall be determined from the date when the owner or operator determines that delay of repair is necessary.</P>
              <P>(1) If a shutdown is expected within the next 2 months, a special shutdown before that planned shutdown is not required.</P>
              <P>(2) If a shutdown is not expected within the next 2 months, the owner or operator may delay repair as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section. Documentation of a decision to delay repair shall state the reasons repair was delayed and shall specify a schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.</P>
              <P>(i) If a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the potential emissions from delaying repair, the owner or operator may delay repair until the next shutdown of the process equipment associated with the leaking heat exchanger. The owner or operator shall document the basis for the determination that a shutdown for repair would cause greater emissions than the emissions likely to result from delaying repair as specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.</P>

              <P>(A) The owner or operator shall calculate the potential emissions from the leaking heat exchanger by multiplying the concentration of total HAP listed in column A of Table 2 of this subpart in the cooling water from the leaking <PRTPAGE P="573"/>heat exchanger by the flowrate of the cooling water from the leaking heat exchanger by the expected duration of the delay. The owner or operator may calculate potential emissions using total organic carbon concentration instead of total HAP listed in column A of Table 2 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(B) The owner or operator shall determine emissions from purging and depressurizing the equipment that will result from the unscheduled shutdown for the repair.</P>
              <P>(ii) If repair is delayed for reasons other than those specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may delay repair up to a maximum of 120 calendar days. The owner shall demonstrate that the necessary parts or personnel were not available.</P>

              <P>(1) If the pressure relief device does not consist of or include a rupture disk, conduct instrument monitoring, as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure relief device returns to organic HAP service following a pressure release to verify that the pressure relief device is operating with an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background, except as provided in § 63.1024(d).</P>
              <P>(2) If the pressure relief device consists of or includes a rupture disk, install a replacement disk as soon as practicable after a pressure release, but no later than 5 calendar days after the pressure release, except as provided in § 63.1024(d).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Pressure release management.</E> Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, emissions of organic HAP to the atmosphere from pressure relief devices in organic HAP service are prohibited, and the owner or operator must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section for all pressure relief devices in organic HAP service.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> For each emission point, the owner or operator shall meet three stages of compliance, with exceptions specified in this subpart. First, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test or design evaluation to demonstrate either the performance of the control device or control technology being used or the uncontrolled total organic HAP emissions rate from a continuous process vent. Second, the owner or operator shall meet the requirements for demonstrating initial compliance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a demonstration that the required percent reduction or emissions limit is achieved). Third, the owner or operator shall meet the requirements for demonstrating continuous compliance through some form of monitoring (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> continuous monitoring of operating parameters).</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Large control devices and small control devices.</E> A large control device is a control device that controls emission points with total emissions of 10 tons of organic HAP per year or more before control. A small control device is a control device that controls emission points with total emissions less than 10 tons of organic HAP per year before control.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Large control devices.</E> Owners or operators are required to conduct a performance test for a large control device. The establishment of parameter monitoring levels shall be based on data obtained during the required performance test.</P>

An owner or operator may choose to conduct a performance test for a small control device and such a performance test shall follow the procedures specified in this section, as appropriate. Whenever a small control device becomes a large control device, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test following the procedures specified in this section, as appropriate. Notification that such a performance test is required, the site-specific test plan, and the results of the performance test shall be provided to the Administrator as specified in § 63.1417. Except as provided in § 63.1415(a)(2), the parameter monitoring levels for small control devices shall be set based on the design evaluation required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Further, when setting the parameter monitoring level(s) based on the design evaluation, the owner or operator shall submit the information specified in § 63.1417(d)(7) for review and approval as part of the Precompliance Report.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Uncontrolled continuous process vents.</E> Owners or operators are required to conduct either a performance test or a design evaluation for continuous process vents that are not controlled through either a large or small control device.</P>

Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests. Data shall be reduced in accordance with the EPA approved methods specified in this subpart or, if other test methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of Appendix A of this part.</P>

              <P>(E) A control device for which a performance test was already conducted for determining compliance with another regulation promulgated by the EPA, provided the test was conducted using the same Methods specified in this section, and either no deliberate process changes have been made since the test, or the owner or operator can demonstrate that the results of the performance test, with or without adjustments, reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes. Parameter monitoring levels established based on such a performance test may be used for purposes of demonstrating continuous compliance with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exceptions to performance test requirements in the General Provisions.</E> (A) Performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions achievable during either the 6-month period ending 2 months before the Notification of Compliance Status required by § 63.1417(e) is due, or during the 6-month period surrounding the date of the performance test (i.e., the period beginning 3 months prior to the performance test and ending 3 months after the performance test). In achieving maximum representative operating conditions, an owner or operator is not required to cause damage to equipment, make a product that does not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer, or make a product in excess of demand.</P>
              <P>(B) When § 63.7(g) references the Notification of Compliance Status requirements in § 63.9(h), the requirements in § 63.1417(e) shall apply for purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(C) Performance tests shall be performed no later than 150 days after the compliance dates specified in this subpart (i.e., in time for the results to be included in the Notification of Compliance Status), rather than according to the time periods in § 63.7(a)(2).</P>

As applicable, a design evaluation shall address the organic HAP emissions rate from uncontrolled continuous process vents, the composition and organic HAP concentration of the vent stream(s) entering a control device or control technology, the operating parameters of the emission point and any control device or control technology, and other conditions or parameters that reflect the performance of the control device or control technology or the organic HAP emission rate from a continuous process vent. A design evaluation also shall address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section, for controlled vent streams, depending on the type of control device that is used. If the vent stream(s) is not the only inlet to the control device, the efficiency demonstration also shall consider all other vapors, gases, and liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.</P>

              <P>(i) For a scrubber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration, temperature, and the reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration level and include the additional information <PRTPAGE P="579"/>in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section for trays and a packed column scrubber:</P>

Under paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, an owner or operator groups together several batch emission episodes and conducts a single performance test for the batch emission episode that is the most challenging, in terms of achieving emission reductions, for the control device or control technology; thereby demonstrating that the achieved emission reduction for the tested batch emission episode is the minimum control device or control technology performance expected for each batch emission episode in the group.

              <P>(B) <E T="03">Testing only the most challenging batch emission episode.</E> Under this paragraph, an owner or operator groups together several batch emission episodes and conducts a single performance test for the batch emission episode that is the most challenging, in terms of achieving emission reductions, for the control device or control technology; thereby demonstrating that the achieved emission reduction for the tested batch emission episode is the minimum control device or control technology performance expected for each batch emission episode in the group. The owner or operator shall use the control device efficiency determined from the performance test for all the other batch emission episodes in that group for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. Performance tests shall be conducted using the testing procedures specified in § 63.1414(a) and (b) and the following procedures:</P>

Previous test results may be used to develop the emission profile provided the results are still relevant to the current batch process vent conditions. The emission profile shall be included in the site-specific test plan required by § 63.1417(h)(2).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Provide rationale for why the control device efficiency for all the other batch emission episodes in the group will be greater than or equal to the control device efficiency achieved during the tested period of the most challenging batch emission episode in the group, as specified in the Notification of Compliance Status Report required by § 63.1417(e).</P>

              <P>(1) An affected source is either an existing affected source or a new affected source. Existing affected source is defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and new affected source is defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) An existing affected source is defined as the group of one or more polyether polyol manufacturing process units (PMPUs) and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that is not part of a new affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and that is located at a plant site that is a major source.</P>
              <P>(3) A new affected source is defined as a source that meets the criteria of paragraph (a)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. The situation described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section is distinct from those situations described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) At a site without organic HAP emission points before September 4, 1997 (i.e., a “greenfield” site), the group of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, that is part of a major source, and on which construction for the PMPU(s) commenced after September 4, 1997;</P>
              <P>(ii) The group of one or more PMPUs meeting the criteria in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(iii) A reconstructed affected source meeting the criteria in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The affected source also includes the emission points and components specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (vi) of this section that are associated with a PMPU (or a group of PMPUs) making up an affected source, as defined in § 63.1423.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">PMPUs without organic HAP.</E> The owner or operator of a PMPU that is part of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, but that does not use or manufacture any organic HAP during the production of one or more products is only subject to the provisions of this subpart as specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. Products or raw material(s) containing organic HAP as impurities only are not considered organic HAP for the purposes of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(1) If an organic HAP is not used or manufactured in the production of polyether polyols, the PMPU is not subject to any provisions of this subpart, except that the owner or operator shall comply with either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. The owner or operator is not required to comply with the provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A (the General Provisions) for that PMPU.</P>
              <P>(i) Retain information, data, and analyses used to document the basis for the determination that the PMPU does not use or manufacture any organic HAP. Types of information that could document this determination include, but are not limited to, records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.</P>
              <P>(ii) When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the PMPU does not use or manufacture any organic HAP.</P>

              <P>(2) If an organic HAP is used or manufactured in the production of polyether polyols, but an organic HAP is not used in the production of one or more products that are not polyether polyols, the PMPU is not subject to any provision of this subpart other than paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this <PRTPAGE P="625"/>section during the production of the non-polyether polyol products that do not use or manufacture any organic HAP.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Emission points included in the affected source but not subject to the provisions of this subpart.</E> The affected source includes the emission points listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (12) of this section, but these emission points are not subject to the requirements of this subpart or the provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.</P>

However, the owner or operator shall continue to operate any existing combustion, recovery, or recapture devices that are required for compliance during the production of polyether polyols, with the exceptions provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section. If extended cookout (ECO) is the control technique chosen for epoxide emission reduction, then ECO or a control technique providing an equivalent reduction in epoxide emissions should continue to be used for epoxide emission reduction, if the non-polyether polyol being produced uses epoxide monomers.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Monitoring requirements.</E> The owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements of this subpart in accordance with paragraphs (e)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, and paragraph (e)(5)(ii)(C) of this section if applicable.</P>
              <P>(A) The owner or operator shall establish a single parameter monitoring level (for each parameter required to be monitored at each device subject to monitoring requirements) in accordance with § 63.1438(a) based on emission point and control technique characteristics when polyether polyol is being produced.</P>
              <P>(B) The owner or operator shall monitor each parameter at each device subject to monitoring requirements at all times (during periods when the PMPU produces polyether polyols, and during periods when the PMPU produces products other than polyether polyols), with the exceptions provided in paragraph (e)(5)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) If ECO is used to reduce epoxide emissions, a parameter monitoring level shall be established for the production of non-polyether polyol products as the average of the established parameter levels for all product classes produced. During periods when products other than polyether polyols are produced, the ECO shall be performed so that the parameter monitoring level established for the production of non-polyether polyol products is maintained when the ECO is used as a control technique.</P>

              <P>(9) <E T="03">PMPUs terminating production of all polyether polyols.</E> If a PMPU terminates the production of all polyether polyols, and the owner or operator does not anticipate the production of any polyether polyols in the future in that PMPU, the process unit is no longer a PMPU and is not subject to this subpart after notification is made to the Administrator. This notification shall be accompanied by a rationale for why it is anticipated that no polyether polyols will be produced in the process unit in the future.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Redetermination of applicability to PMPUs that are flexible operation units.</E> Whenever changes in production occur that could reasonably be expected to change the primary product of a PMPU that is operating as a flexible operation unit from a polyether polyol to a product that would make the process unit subject to another subpart of this part, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the primary product, in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the conditions in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) of this section are met, the flexible operation unit shall no longer be designated as a PMPU after the compliance date of the other subpart, and shall no longer be subject to the provisions of this subpart after the date that the process unit is required to be in compliance with the provisions of the other subpart. If the conditions in paragraphs (e)(10)(i) through (iii) of this section are not met, the flexible operation unit shall continue to be considered a PMPU and subject to the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(1) If a storage vessel is already subject to another subpart of 40 CFR part 63 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories) on June 1, 1999, that storage vessel shall be assigned to the process unit subject to the other subpart, and none of the other provisions in this subpart shall apply to that storage vessel.</P>
              <P>(2) If a storage vessel is dedicated to a single process unit, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.</P>
              <P>(3) If a storage vessel is shared among process units, then the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit located on the same plant site as the storage vessel that has the greatest input into or output from the storage vessel (i.e., the process unit that has the predominant use of the storage vessel.)</P>
              <P>(4) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if only one of those process units is a PMPU subject to this subpart, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that PMPU.</P>
              <P>(5) If predominant use cannot be determined for a storage vessel that is shared among process units and if more than one of the process units are PMPUs that have different primary products and that are subject to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall assign the storage vessel to any one of the PMPUs sharing the storage vessel.</P>

              <P>(6) If the predominant use of a storage vessel varies from year to year, then predominant use shall be determined based on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding June 1, 1999 or based on the expected utilization for the 5 years following June 1, 1999 for existing affected sources, whichever is more representative of the expected operations for that storage vessel, and based on the expected utilization for the 5 years after initial <PRTPAGE P="629"/>start-up for new affected sources. The determination of predominant use shall be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status, as required by § 63.1439(e)(5)(v).</P>
              <P>(7) Where a storage vessel is located at a major source that includes one or more process units which place material into or receive material from the storage vessel, but the storage vessel is located in a tank farm (including a marine tank farm), the applicability of this subpart shall be determined according to the provisions in paragraphs (f)(7)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The storage vessel may only be assigned to a process unit that utilizes the storage vessel and does not have an intervening storage vessel for that product (or raw materials, as appropriate). With respect to any process unit, an intervening storage vessel means a storage vessel connected by hard-piping to both the process unit and the storage vessel in the tank farm so that product or raw material entering or leaving the process unit flows into (or from) the intervening storage vessel and does not flow directly into (or from) the storage vessel in the tank farm.</P>
              <P>(ii) If there is no process unit at the major source that meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, this subpart does not apply to the storage vessel.</P>
              <P>(iii) If there is only one process unit at the major source that meets the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to that process unit.</P>
              <P>(iv) If there are two or more process units at the major source that meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section with respect to a storage vessel, the storage vessel shall be assigned to one of those process units according to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(3) through (6) of this section. The predominant use shall be determined among only those process units that meet the criteria of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) If the storage vessel begins receiving material from (or sending material to) a process unit that was not included in the initial determination, or ceases to receive material from (or send material to) a process unit that was included in the initial determination, the owner or operator shall reevaluate the applicability of this subpart to that storage vessel.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Changes or additions to plant sites.</E> The provisions of this paragraph apply to the owner or operator that changes or adds to their plant site or affected source.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Adding a PMPU to a plant site.</E> The provisions of paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to the owner or operator that adds one or more PMPUs to a plant site. A PMPU may be added to a plant site by constructing or reconstructing a process unit to produce polyether polyols. A PMPU may also be added to a plant site due to changes in production (anticipated production or actual past production) such that a polyether polyol becomes the primary product of a process unit that was not previously a PMPU.</P>
              <P>(i) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, the added group of one or more PMPUs and their associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up or by June 1, 1999, whichever is later, if the added group of one or more PMPUs meets the criteria specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section and either meets the criteria in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) The process units are new process units, as defined in § 63.1423.</P>
              <P>(B) The added group of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, has the potential to emit 10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year) or more of any organic HAP or 25 tons per year (22.7 megagrams per year) or more of any combination of organic HAP, and polyether polyols are currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of an affected source.</P>

              <P>(C) A polyether polyol is not currently produced at the plant site as the primary product of an affected source, and the plant site meets, or after the addition is constructed will meet, the <PRTPAGE P="630"/>General Provisions' definition of a major source in § 63.2.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a group of one or more PMPUs is added to a plant site, and the added group of one or more PMPUs does not meet the criteria specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section and one of the criteria specified in either paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) or (C) of this section, and the plant site meets, or after the addition will meet, the definition of a major source, the owner or operator of the added group of one or more PMPUs and associated equipment, as listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, shall comply with the requirements for an existing affected source in this subpart upon initial start-up; by June 1, 2002; or by 6 months after notifying the Administrator that a process unit has been designated as a PMPU (in accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section), whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Adding emission points or making process changes to existing affected sources.</E> The provisions of paragraphs (g)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section apply to the owner or operator that adds emission points or makes process changes to an existing affected source.</P>
              <P>(i) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, the entire affected source shall be a new affected source and shall comply with the requirements for a new affected source upon initial start-up or by June 1, 1999, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(A) The replacement of components meets the definition of reconstruction in § 63.1423(b). For purposes of determining whether the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct an entire affected source, the equivalent capital cost shall be the entire potentially affected source; and</P>
              <P>(B) Such reconstruction commenced after September 4, 1997.</P>
              <P>(ii) If any components are replaced at an existing affected source such that the criteria specified in paragraphs (g)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are not met and that replacement of components creates one or more emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, heat exchange systems subject to § 63.1435, or equipment leak components subject § 63.1434), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance upon initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 63.1422 (i.e., December 1, 1999 for most equipment leak components subject to § 63.1434, and June 1, 2002 for emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(iii) If an addition or process change (not including a process change that solely replaces components) is made that creates one or more Group 1 emission points (i.e., either newly created Group 1 emission points or emission points that change group status from Group 2 to Group 1) or causes any other emission point to be added (i.e., Group 2 emission points, heat exchange systems subject to § 63.1435, or equipment leak components subject to § 63.1434), the resulting emission point(s) shall be subject to the applicable requirements for an existing affected source. The resulting emission point(s) shall be in compliance by initial start-up or by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 63.1422 (i.e., December 1, 1999 for most equipment leak components subject to § 63.1434, and June 1, 2002 for emission points other than equipment leaks), whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Determining what are and are not process changes.</E> For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, examples of process changes include, but are not limited to, additions in process equipment resulting in changes in production capacity; production of a product outside the scope of the compliance demonstration; or whenever there is a replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, process changes do not include: process upsets, unintentional temporary process changes, and changes that do not alter the equipment configuration and operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Reporting requirements for owners or operators that change or add to their <PRTPAGE P="631"/>plant site or affected source.</E> An owner or operator that changes or adds to their plant site or affected source, as discussed in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, shall submit a report as specified in § 63.1439(e)(7)(iii).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Applicability of this subpart.</E> (1) The emission limitations set forth in this subpart and the emission limitations referred to in this subpart shall apply at all times except during periods of nonoperation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies.</P>
              <P>(2) The emission limitations set forth in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H, as referred to in the equipment leak provisions in § 63.1434, shall apply at all times except during periods of non-operation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) in which the lines are drained and depressurized resulting in cessation of the emissions to which § 63.1434 applies.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner or operator shall not shut down items of equipment that are required or utilized for compliance with this subpart during times when emissions (or, where applicable, wastewater streams or residuals) are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown would contravene requirements applicable to such items of equipment.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">General duty.</E> At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Affirmative defense for violation of emission standards during malfunction.</E> In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart, the owner or operator may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at § 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed if the owner or operator fails to meet their burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Assertion of affirmative defense.</E> To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a standard, the owner or operator must timely meet the reporting requirements in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:</P>
              <P>(i) The violation:</P>
              <P>(A) Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner; and</P>
              <P>(B) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design or better operation and maintenance practices; and</P>
              <P>(C) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and</P>
              <P>(D) Was not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when a violation occurred; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The frequency, amount, and duration of the violation (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable; and</P>
              <P>(iv) If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Process vent requirements for processes using extended cookout as an epoxide emission reduction technique.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability of extended cookout requirements.</E> Owners or operators of affected sources that produce polyether polyols using epoxides, and that are using ECO as a control technique to reduce epoxide emissions in order to comply with percent emission reduction requirements in § 63.1425(b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) shall comply with the provisions of this section. The owner or operator that is using ECO in order to comply with the emission factor requirements in § 63.1425(b)(1)(iii) or § 63.1425(b)(2)(iv) shall demonstrate that the specified emission factor is achieved by following the requirements in § 63.1431. If additional control devices are used to further reduce the HAP emissions from a process vent already controlled by ECO, then the owner or <PRTPAGE P="654"/>operator shall also comply with the testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements associated with the additional control device, as specified in §§ 63.1426, 63.1429, and 63.1430, respectively.</P>
              <P>(1) For each product class, the owner or operator shall determine the batch cycle percent epoxide emission reduction for the most difficult to control product in the product class, where the most difficult to control product is the polyether polyol that is manufactured with the slowest pressure decay curve.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator may determine the batch cycle percent epoxide emission reduction by directly measuring the concentration of the unreacted epoxide, or by using process knowledge, reaction kinetics, and engineering knowledge, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) If the owner or operator elects to use any method other than direct measurement, the epoxide concentration shall be determined by direct measurement for one product from each product class and compared with the epoxide concentration determined using the selected estimation method, with the exception noted in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. If the difference between the directly determined epoxide concentration and the calculated epoxide concentration is less than 25 percent, then the selected estimation method will be considered to be an acceptable alternative to direct measurement for that class.</P>
              <P>(ii) If uncontrolled epoxide emissions prior to the end of the ECO are less than 10 tons per year (9.1 megagrams per year), the owner or operator is not required to perform the direct measurement required in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Uncontrolled epoxide emissions prior to the end of the ECO shall be determined by the procedures in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Define the end of epoxide feed.</E> The owner or operator shall define the end of the epoxide feed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The owner or operator shall determine the concentration of epoxide in the reactor liquid at the point in time when all epoxide has been added to the reactor and prior to any venting. This concentration shall be determined in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section are met, the end of the epoxide feed may be defined by the reactor epoxide partial pressure at the point in time when all epoxide reactants have been added to the reactor. This reactor epoxide partial pressure shall be determined in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) No epoxide is emitted before the end of the ECO;</P>
              <P>(ii) Extended cookout is the only control technique to reduce epoxide emissions; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator elects to determine the percent epoxide emission reduction for the ECO using reactor epoxide partial pressure in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Define the onset of the ECO.</E> The owner or operator shall calculate the uncontrolled emissions for the batch cycle by calculating the epoxide emissions, if any, prior to the onset of the ECO, plus the epoxide emissions at the onset of the ECO. The onset of the ECO is defined as the point in time when the combined unreacted epoxide concentration in the reactor liquid is equal to 25 percent of the concentration of epoxides at the end of the epoxide feed, which was determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The uncontrolled epoxide emissions for the batch cycle shall be determined using Equation 8.</P>

              <P>(a) Performance testing shall be conducted in accordance with § 63.7(a)(1), (a)(3), (d), (e)(2), (e)(4), (g), and (h), with the exceptions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section and the additions specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator or an applicable subpart. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.</P>

              <P>(1) Performance tests shall be conducted according to the general provisions' performance testing requirements in § 63.7(e)(2), except that for all emission sources except process vents from batch unit operations, performance tests shall be conducted during maximum representative operating conditions for the process achievable during one of the time periods described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this <PRTPAGE P="679"/>section, without causing any of the situations described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section to occur. For process vents from batch unit operations, performance tests shall be conducted either at absolute worst-case conditions or hypothetical worst-case conditions, as defined in § 63.1426(c)(3)(i)(B), that are achievable during one of the time periods described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, without causing any of the situations described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section to occur.</P>
              <P>(i) The 6-month period that ends 2 months before the Notification of Compliance Status is due, according to § 63.1439(e)(5); or the 6-month period that begins 3 months before the performance test and ends 3 months after the performance test.</P>
              <P>(ii) Causing damage to equipment; necessitating that the owner or operator make a product that does not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer; or necessitating that the owner or operator make a product in excess of demand.</P>
              <P>(iii) Causing plant or testing personnel to be subject to unsafe conditions. Owners or operators that limit testing based on this paragraph shall maintain documentation that demonstrates the nature of the unsafe conditions and explains measures considered by the owner or operator to overcome these conditions. If requested, this documentation shall be provided to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) When the General Provisions' data analysis, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements in § 63.7(g) refer to the Notification of Compliance Status requirements in § 63.9(h), the Notification of Compliance Status requirements in § 63.1439(e)(5) shall instead apply, for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) Because the General Provisions' site-specific test plan in § 63.7(c)(3) is not required, the General Provisions' requirement for the Administrator to approve or deny site-specific test plans, in § 63.7(h)(4)(ii), is not applicable for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator of an affected source shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, the owner or operator of an affected source shall notify the Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled test date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) by mutual agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) Data shall be reduced in accordance with the EPA approved methods specified in the applicable subpart or, if other test methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according to the protocol in Method 301, 40 CFR part 63, appendix A.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, if an owner or operator of an affected source uses a flare to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart, the owner or operator shall comply with paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section. The owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test to determine percent emission reduction or outlet organic HAP or TOC concentration. If a compliance demonstration has been conducted previously for a flare, using the techniques specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, that compliance demonstration may be used to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if either no deliberate process changes have been made since the compliance demonstration, or the results of the compliance demonstration reliably demonstrate compliance despite process changes.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Process vents from continuous unit operations.</E> During initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be continuously monitored during the required 1-hour runs for process vents from continuous unit operations. The monitoring level(s) shall then be established as the average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from the three 1-hour test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be used when establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum values shall be used when establishing a minimum level.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Process vents from batch unit operations.</E> For process vents from batch unit operations, during initial compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be monitored continuously during the entire test period.

              <P>(A) When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over the time during which the storage vessel is being filled (i.e., when the liquid level in the storage vessel is being raised), is above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given parameters.</P>
              <P>(B) When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available, due to monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments, for at least 75 percent of the specific intervals at which parameters are to be monitored and recorded, according to the storage vessel's monitoring plan, during which the storage vessel is being filled.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating requirement.</P>
              <P>(3) With respect to process vents from batch unit operations, an excursion means one of the two cases listed in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</P>

Monitoring data shall be considered insufficient when measured values are not available, due to monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments, for at least 75 percent of the 15-minute periods when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device during the operating day, using the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to the control device.</P>
              <P>(B) Subtract the time during the periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies, from the total amount of time determined above in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, to obtain the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient.</P>
              <P>(C) Determine the total number of 15-minute periods in the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General recordkeeping and reporting provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Data retention.</E> Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, the owner or operator of an affected source shall keep copies of all applicable records and reports required by this subpart for at least 5 years. All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours after a request. The remaining 4 and one-half years of records may be retained offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable form including, but not limited to, on microfilm, computer, floppy disk, magnetic <PRTPAGE P="683"/>tape, or microfiche. If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the applicable EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the requirement of § 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Subpart A requirements.</E> The owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A (the General Provisions) as specified in Table 1 of this subpart. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Malfunction recordkeeping and reporting.</E> (i) <E T="03">Records of malfunctions.</E> The owner or operator shall keep the records specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) In the event that an affected unit fails to meet an applicable standard, record the number of failures. For each failure record the date, time, and duration of each failure.</P>
              <P>(B) For each failure to meet an applicable standard, record and retain a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.</P>
              <P>(C) Record actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.1420(h)(4), and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reports of malfunctions.</E> If a source fails to meet an applicable standard, report such events in the Periodic Report. Report the number of failures to meet an applicable standard. For each instance, report the date, time, and duration of each failure. For each failure the report must include a list of the affected sources or equipment, an estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any emission limit, and a description of the method used to estimate the emissions.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for approval of construction or reconstruction.</E> For new affected sources, the owner or operator shall comply with the General Provisions' requirements for the application for approval of construction or reconstruction, as specified in § 63.5, excluding the provisions specified in § 63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(2), and (d)(3)(ii).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Subpart H requirements.</E> The owner or operator of an affected source shall comply with the HON equipment leak reporting and recordkeeping requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H, except as specified in § 63.1434(b) through (h).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Recordkeeping and documentation.</E> The owner or operator required to keep continuous records shall keep records as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (10) of this section, unless an alternative recordkeeping system has been requested and approved as specified in paragraph (g) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. If a monitoring plan for storage vessels pursuant to § 63.1432(i) requires continuous records, the monitoring plan shall specify which provisions, if any, of paragraphs (d)(1) through (10) of this section apply. As described in § 63.1432(i), certain storage vessels are not required to keep continuous records as specified in this paragraph. The owner or operator of such storage vessels shall keep records as specified in the monitoring plan required by § 63.1432(i).</P>
              <P>(1) The monitoring system shall measure data values at least once during approximately equal 15-minute intervals.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator shall record either each measured data value or block average values for 1 hour or shorter periods calculated from all measured data values during each period. If values are measured more frequently than once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate the hourly (or shorter period) block average instead of all measured values. The owner or operator of process vents from batch unit operations shall record each measured data value.</P>

              <P>(3) Daily average values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be calculated for each operating day as specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (ii) of this section, except as specified <PRTPAGE P="684"/>in paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The daily average value shall be calculated as the average of all parameter values recorded during the operating day, except as specified in paragraph (d)(7) of this section. The calculated average shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous. If intermittent emissions episodes occur resulting in emissions being vented to a combustion, recapture, or recovery device for a period of less than 24 hours in the operating day, the daily average shall be calculated based only on the period when emissions are being vented to the combustion, recapture, or recovery device. For example, if a batch unit operation operates such that emissions are vented to a combustion device for 6 hours, then the daily average is the average of the temperature measurements taken during those 6 hours.</P>
              <P>(ii) The operating day shall be the 24-hour period that the owner or operator specifies in the operating permit or the Notification of Compliance Status, for purposes of determining daily average values.</P>
              <P>(4)-(5) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(6) If all recorded values for a monitored parameter during an operating day are above the minimum level or below the maximum level established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating permit, the owner or operator may record that all values were above the minimum level or below the maximum level rather than calculating and recording a daily average for that operating day.</P>
              <P>(7) Monitoring data recorded during periods identified in paragraphs (d)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section shall not be included in any average computed under this subpart. Records shall be kept of the times and durations of all such periods and any other periods during process or combustion, recovery, or recapture device operation when monitors are not operating.</P>
              <P>(i) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the monitoring applies.</P>
              <P>(8) For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this subpart, records documenting the completion of calibration checks, and records documenting the maintenance of continuous monitoring systems that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or that are specified in other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.</P>
              <P>(9) The owner or operator of an affected source granted a waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements under the General Provisions' recordkeeping and reporting requirements in § 63.10(f) shall maintain the information, if any, specified by the Administrator as a condition of the waiver of recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
              <P>(10) For pressure relief devices in organic HAP service, keep records of the information specified in paragraphs (d)(10)(i) through (v) of this section, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(i) A list of identification numbers for pressure relief devices that the owner or operator elects to equip with a closed-vent system and control device, subject to the provisions in § 63.1434(c)(4).</P>
