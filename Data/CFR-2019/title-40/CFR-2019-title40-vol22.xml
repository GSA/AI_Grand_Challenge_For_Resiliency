      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>This section describes the emission standards that apply for Tier 6 and Tier 8 engines. The standards of this section apply for aircraft engines manufactured on or after July 18, 2012, except where we specify that they apply differently by year, or where the engine is exempt from one or more standards of this section. Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, these standards apply based on the date the engine is manufactured. Where a gaseous emission standard is specified by a formula, calculate and round the standard to three significant figures or to the nearest 0.1 g/kN (for standards at or above 100 g/kN). Where a smoke <PRTPAGE P="11"/>standard is specified by a formula, calculate and round the standard to the nearest 0.1 SN. Engines comply with an applicable standard if the testing results show that the engine type certificate family's characteristic level does not exceed the numerical level of that standard, as described in § 87.60. The tier of standards identified for an engine relates to NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions and that the specified standards for HC, CO, and smoke emissions apply independent of the changes to the NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standards.</P>

              <P>(a) New turboprop aircraft engines with rated output at or above 1,000 kilowatts must comply with a smoke standard of 187 · rO<E T="51">−0.168</E>.</P>

              <P>(d) This paragraph (d) specifies phase-in provisions that allow continued production of certain engines after the Tier 6 and Tier 8 standards begin to apply.</P>

              <P>(1) Engine type certificate families certificated with characteristic levels at or below the Tier 4 NO<E T="52">X</E> standards of § 87.21 (as applicable based on rated output and rated pressure ratio) and introduced before July 18, 2012 may be produced through December 31, 2012 without meeting the Tier 6 NO<E T="52">X</E> standards of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This also applies for engines that are covered by the same type certificate and are determined to be derivative engines for emissions certification purposes under the requirements of this part. Note that after this production cutoff date for the Tier 6 NO<E T="52">X</E> standards, such engines may be produced only if they are covered by an exemption under § 87.50. This production cutoff does not apply to engines installed (or delivered for installation) on military aircraft.</P>

              <P>(2) Engine type certificate families certificated with characteristic levels at or below the Tier 6 NO<E T="52">X</E> standards of paragraph (c)(2) of this section with an introduction date before January 1, 2014 may continue to be produced. This also applies for engines that are covered by the same type certificate and are determined to be derivative engines for emissions certification purposes under the requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(3) An engine manufacturer may produce up to six newly manufactured Tier 4 engines on or after July 18, 2012, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (d)(3). Tier 4 engines meeting the criteria of this paragraph (d)(3) are excepted without request from the otherwise applicable Tier 6 NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standard. To be eligible for this exception the engines must have a date of manufacture prior to August 31, 2013 and be fully compliant with all requirements applicable to Tier 4 engines. The manufacturer must include these engines in the report required by § 87.50. This exception is void for any manufacturer that produces more than six excepted engines under this paragraph.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Derivative engines for emissions certification purposes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A type certificate holder may request from the FAA a determination that an engine configuration is considered a derivative engine for emissions certification purposes. This would mean that the engine configuration is determined to be similar in design to a previously certificated engine (the “original” engine) for purposes of compliance with exhaust emission standards (gaseous and smoke). In order for the engine configuration to be considered a derivative engine for emission purposes under this part, it must have been derived from an original engine that was certificated to the requirements of 14 CFR part 33, and one of the following conditions must be met:</P>
              <P>(1) The FAA determined that a safety issue exists that requires an engine modification.</P>
              <P>(2) Emissions from the derivative engines are determined to be similar. In general, this means the emissions must meet the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section. FAA may adjust these criteria in unusual circumstances, consistent with good engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(3) All of the regulated emissions from the derivative engine are lower than the original engine.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Emissions similarity.</E> (1) The type certificate holder must demonstrate that the proposed derivative engine model's emissions meet the applicable standards and differ from the original model's emission rates only within the following ranges:</P>
              <P>(i) ±3.0 g/kN for NO<E T="52">X</E>.</P>
              <P>(ii) ±1.0 g/kN for HC.</P>
              <P>(iii) ±5.0 g/kN for CO.</P>
              <P>(iv) ±2.0 SN for smoke.</P>

              <P>(2) If the characteristic level of the original certificated engine model (or any other sub-models within the emission type certificate family tested for certification) before modification is at or above 95% of the applicable standard for any pollutant, you must measure the proposed derivative engine model's emissions for all pollutants to demonstrate that the derivative engine's resulting characteristic levels will not exceed the applicable emission standards. If the characteristic levels of the originally certificated engine model (and all other sub-models within the emission type certificate family tested for certification) are below 95% of the applicable standard for each pollutant, then, you may use engineering analysis to demonstrate that the derivative engine will not exceed the applicable emission standards, consistent with <PRTPAGE P="15"/>good engineering judgment. The engineering analysis must address all modifications from the original engine, including those approved for previous derivative engines.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Continued production allowance.</E> Where we allow continued production of an engine model after new standards begin to apply, you may also produce engine derivatives if they conform to the specifications of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Non-derivative engines.</E> If the FAA determines that an engine model does not meet the requirements for a derivative engine for emissions certification purposes, the type certificate holder is required to demonstrate that the engine complies with the emissions standards applicable to a new engine type.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions and exceptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This section specifies provisions related to exempting/excepting engines from some or all of the standards and requirements of this part 87. Exempted/excepted engines must conform to regulatory conditions specified for an exemption in this section and other applicable regulations. Exempted/excepted engines are deemed to be “subject to” the standards of this part even though they are not required to comply with the otherwise applicable requirements. Engines exempted/excepted with respect to certain standards must comply with other standards. Exemption requests under paragraph (a) of this section must be approved by the FAA, with the written concurrence of EPA, to be effective. Exemption requests under paragraph (b) of this section must be approved only by the FAA to be effective. Exceptions do not require a case-by-case FAA approval.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Engines installed in new aircraft.</E> Type certificate holders may request an exemption to produce a limited number of newly manufactured engines through December 31, 2016, to be installed in new aircraft as specified in this paragraph (a). This exemption is limited to NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions from engines that are covered by a valid type certificate issued by FAA.</P>
              <P>(1) Submit your request for an exemption to the FAA before producing the engines to be exempted, who will provide a copy to the Designated EPA Program Officer. Exemption by an authority outside the United States does not satisfy this requirement. Unless EPA and FAA allow otherwise, all requests must include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Your corporate name and an authorized representative's contact information.</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of the engines for which you are requesting the exemption including the type certificate number and date it was issued by the FAA. Include in your description the engine model and sub-model names and the types of aircraft in which the engines are expected to be installed. Specify the number of engines that you would produce under the exemption and the period during which you would produce them.</P>
              <P>(iii) Information about the aircraft in which the engines will be installed. Specify the airframe models and expected first purchasers/users of the aircraft. Identify all countries in which you expect the aircraft to be registered. Specify how many aircraft will be registered in the United States and how many will be registered in other countries; you may estimate this if it is not known.</P>
              <P>(iv) A justification of why the exemption is appropriate. Justifications must include a description of the environmental impact of granting the exemption. Include other relevant information such as the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Technical issues, from an environmental and airworthiness perspective, which may have caused a delay in compliance with a production cutoff.</P>
              <P>(B) Economic impacts on the manufacturer, operator(s), and aviation industry at large.</P>
              <P>(C) Environmental effects. This should consider the amount of additional air pollutant emissions that will result from the exemption. This could include consideration of items such as:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The amount that the engine model exceeds the standard, taking into account any other engine models in the engine type certificate family <PRTPAGE P="16"/>covered by the same type certificate and their relation to the standard.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The amount of the applicable air pollutant that would be emitted by an alternative engine for the same application.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The impact of changes to reduce the applicable air pollutant on other environmental factors, including emission rates of other air pollutants, community noise, and fuel consumption.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The degree to which the adverse impact would be offset by cleaner engines produced in the same time period (unless we decide to consider earlier engines).</P>
              <P>(D) Impact of unforeseen circumstances and hardship due to business circumstances beyond your control (such as an employee strike, supplier disruption, or calamitous events).</P>
              <P>(E) Projected future production volumes and plans for producing a compliant version of the engine model in question.</P>
              <P>(F) Equity issues in administering the production cutoff among economically competing parties.</P>
              <P>(G) List of other certificating authorities from which you have requested (or expect to request) exemptions, and a summary of the request.</P>
              <P>(H) Any other relevant factors.</P>
              <P>(v) A statement signed by your authorized representative attesting that all information included in the request is accurate.</P>
              <P>(2) In consultation with the EPA, the FAA may specify additional conditions for the exemption.</P>
              <P>(3) You must submit the annual report specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The permanent record for each engine exempted under this paragraph (a) must indicate that the engine is an exempted new engine.</P>
              <P>(5) Engines exempted under this paragraph (a) must be labeled with the following statement: “EXEMPT NEW”.</P>
              <P>(6) You must notify the FAA if you determine after submitting your request that the information is not accurate, either from an error or from changing circumstances. If you believe the new or changed information could have affected approval of your exemption (including information that could have affected the number of engines we exempt), you must notify the FAA promptly. The FAA will consult with EPA as needed to address any concerns related to this new or corrected information.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary exemptions based on flights for short durations at infrequent intervals.</E> The emission standards of this part do not apply to engines which power aircraft operated in the United States for short durations at infrequent intervals. Such operations are limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Flights of an aircraft for the purpose of export to a foreign country, including any flights essential to demonstrate the integrity of an aircraft prior to its flight to a point outside the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) Flights to a base where repairs, alterations or maintenance are to be performed, or to a point of storage, and flights for the purpose of returning an aircraft to service.</P>
              <P>(3) Official visits by representatives of foreign governments.</P>
              <P>(4) Other flights the Secretary determines to be for short durations at infrequent intervals. A request for such a determination shall be made before the flight takes place.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Spare engines.</E> Newly manufactured engines meeting the definition of “spare engine” are excepted as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) This exception allows production of a newly manufactured engine for installation on an in-service aircraft. It does not allow for installation of a spare engine on a new aircraft.</P>
              <P>(2) Each spare engine must be identical to a sub-model previously certificated to meet all requirements applicable to Tier 4 engines or later requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) Spare engines excepted under this paragraph (c) may be used only where the emissions of the spare engines are certificated to equal to or lower emission standards than those of the engines they are replacing, for all regulated pollutants.</P>
              <P>(4) No prior approval is required to produce spare engines. Engine manufacturers must include information about their production of spare engines in the annual report specified in paragraph (d) of this section</P>

              <P>(5) The permanent record for each engine excepted under this paragraph (c) <PRTPAGE P="17"/>must indicate that the engine was produced as an excepted spare engine.</P>
              <P>(6) Engines excepted under this paragraph (c) must be labeled with the following statement: “EXCEPTED SPARE”.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Annual reports.</E> If you produce engines with an exemption/exception under this section, you must submit an annual report with respect to such engines.</P>
              <P>(1) You must send the Designated EPA Program Officer a report describing your production of exempted/excepted engines for each calendar year in which you produce such engines by February 28 of the following calendar year. You may include this information in the certification report described in § 87.42. Confirm that the information in your initial request is still accurate, or describe any relevant changes.</P>
              <P>(2) Provide the information specified in this paragraph (d)(2). For purposes of this paragraph (d), treat spare engine exceptions separate from other new engine exemptions. Include the following for each exemption/exception and each engine model and sub-model:</P>
              <P>(i) Engine model and sub-model names.</P>
              <P>(ii) Serial number of each engine.</P>
              <P>(iii) Use of each engine (for example, spare or new installation).</P>
              <P>(iv) Types of aircraft in which the engines were installed (or are intended to be installed for spare engines).</P>
              <P>(v) Serial number of the new aircraft in which engines are installed (if known), or the name of the air carriers (or other operators) using spare engines.</P>
              <P>(3) Include information in the report only for engines having a date of manufacture within the specific calendar year.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Testing engines.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 3, Appendix 5, and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16 (incorporated by reference in § 87.8), as applicable, to demonstrate whether engines meet the gaseous emission standards specified in subpart C of this part. Measure the emissions of all regulated gaseous pollutants. Similarly, use the equipment and procedures specified in Appendix 2 and Appendix 6 of ICAO Annex 16 to determine whether engines meet the smoke standard specified in subpart C of this part. The compliance demonstration consists of establishing a mean value from testing some number of engines, then calculating a “characteristic level” by applying a set of statistical factors that take into account the number of engines tested. Round each characteristic level to the same number of decimal places as the corresponding emission standard. For turboprop engines, use the procedures specified for turbofan engines, consistent with good engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(b) Use a test fuel meeting the specifications described in Appendix 4 of ICAO Annex 16 (incorporated by reference in § 87.8). The test fuel must not have additives whose purpose is to suppress smoke, such as organometallic compounds.</P>
              <P>(c) Prepare test engines by including accessories that are available with production engines if they can reasonably be expected to influence emissions. The test engine may not extract shaft power or bleed service air to provide power to auxiliary gearbox-mounted components required to drive aircraft systems.</P>
              <P>(d) Test engines must reach a steady operating temperature before the start of emission measurements.</P>
              <P>(e) In consultation with the EPA, the FAA may approve alternate procedures for measuring emissions as specified in this paragraph (e). This might include testing and sampling methods, analytical techniques, and equipment specifications that differ from those specified in this part. Manufacturers and operators may request this approval by sending a written request with supporting justification to the FAA and to the Designated EPA Program Officer.

              <SUBJECT>California Pilot Test Program Credits Program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The Administrator shall administer this credit program to enable vehicle manufacturers who are required to participate in the California Pilot Test Program to meet the clean-fuel vehicle sales requirements through the use of credits. Participation in this credit program is voluntary.</P>
              <P>(2) All credit-generating vehicles must meet the applicable emission standards and other requirements contained in subpart A of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Credit generation.</E> (1) Credits may be generated by any of the following means:</P>
              <P>(i) Sale of qualifying clean-fuel vehicles earlier than required. Manufacturers may earn these credits starting with the 1992 model year, contingent upon the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Sale of a greater number of qualifying clean-fuel vehicles than required.</P>
              <P>(iii) Sale of qualifying clean-fuel vehicles that meet more stringent emission standards than those required.</P>
              <P>(2) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, credit values shall be determined in accordance with the following:</P>
              <P>(i) For model-years through 2000, credit values shall be determined in accordance with table B-1 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the 2001 and subsequent model-years, credit values shall be determined according to table B-2 of this subpart. The sale of light-duty vehicles classified as Transitional Low-Emission Vehicles shall not receive credits starting in model year 2001.</P>
              <P>(iii) For the calculation of credits for the sale of more clean-fuel vehicles than required, the manufacturer shall designate which sold vehicles count toward compliance with the sales requirement. The remaining balance of vehicles will be considered as sold beyond the sales requirement for credit calculations.</P>
              <P>(3) Vehicles greater than 8500 lbs gvwr may not generate credits.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit use.</E> (1) All credits generated in accordance with these provisions may be freely averaged, traded, or banked for later use. Credits may not be used to remedy any nonconformity determined by enforcement testing.</P>
              <P>(2) There is one averaging and trading group containing all light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.</P>
              <P>(3) A vehicle manufacturer desiring to demonstrate full or partial compliance with the sales requirements by the redemption of credits, shall surrender sufficient credits, as established in this paragraph (c). In lieu of selling a clean-fuel vehicle, a manufacturer shall surrender credits equal to the credit value for the corresponding vehicle class and model year found in table B-1.3 or table B-2.3 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Participation in the credit program.</E> (1) During certification, the manufacturer shall calculate the projected credits, if any, based on required sales projections.</P>

              <P>(2) Based on information from paragraph (d)(1) of this section, each manufacturer's certification application under this section must demonstrate:<PRTPAGE P="27"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) That at the end of the model-year production, there is a net vehicle credit balance of zero or more with any credits obtained from averaging, trading, or banking.</P>
              <P>(ii) It is recommended but not required that the source of the credits to be used to comply with the minimum sales requirements be stated. All such reports should include all credits involved in averaging, trading, or banking.</P>
              <P>(3) During the model year, manufacturers must:</P>
              <P>(i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that compliance with the sales requirement is achieved at the end of the model year.</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide the end of model year reports required under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(iii) Maintain the records required under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) Projected credits based on information supplied in the certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any other verification steps deemed appropriate by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be determined at the end of the model year.</P>
              <P>(6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be recalculated.</P>
              <P>(i) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates an inadvertent credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to purchase the necessary credits to bring the credit balance to zero.</P>
              <P>(ii) If within 90 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's favor (i.e., resulting in a positive credit balance) or if the manufacturer discovers such an error within 90 days of EPA receipt of the end-of-year report, the credits will be restored for use by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Averaging.</E> Averaging will only be allowed between clean-fuel vehicles under 8500 lbs gvwr.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Banking</E>—(1) <E T="03">Credit deposits.</E> (i) Under this program, credits can be banked starting in the 1992 model year.</P>
              <P>(ii) A manufacturer may bank credits only after the end of the model year and after EPA has reviewed its end-of-year report. During the model year and before submittal of the end-of-year report, credits originally designated in the certification process for banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for trading or averaging.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Credit withdraws.</E> (i) After being generated, banked/reserved credits shall be available for use and shall maintain their original value for an infinite period of time.</P>
              <P>(ii) A manufacturer withdrawing banked credits shall indicate so during certification and in its credit reports.</P>
              <P>(3) Banked credits may be used in averaging, trading, or in any combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits declared for banking from the previous model year but unreviewed by EPA may also be used. However, they may be revoked at a later time following EPA review of the end-of-year report or any subsequent audit actions.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Early credits.</E> Beginning in model year 1992 appropriate credits, as determined from the given credit table, will be given for the sale of vehicles certified to the clean-fuel vehicle standards for TLEVs, LEVs, ULEVs, and ZEVs, where appropriate. For LDVs and light LDTs (&lt;6000 lbs GVWR), early credits can be earned from model year 1992 to the beginning of the Pilot Program sales requirements in 1996. For heavy LDTs (&gt;6000 lbs GVWR), early credits can be earned from model years 1992 through 1997. The actual calculation of early credits shall not begin until model year 1996.</P>

              <P>(ii) The state shall submit a SIP revision before May 15, 1994 to the Administrator stipulating the specific mechanism by which the CFFV program is to be administered and enforced. The credit program shall commence upon EPA approval of the SIP in accordance with CAA section 246(f)(5).</P>
              <P>(2) A fleet owner who purchases/leases a CFFV only to generate CFFV credit shall be subject to the same requirements of the state's CFFV program as a covered fleet owner who purchases/leases a CFFV to demonstrate compliance with covered fleet purchase requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) While in the covered area, a dual-fuel/flexible-fuel vehicle which a fleet owner purchases to comply with covered fleet purchase requirements must be operated at all times on the fuel(s) on which it was certified as a CFFV. If the fleet owner receives credit for a dual-fuel/flexible-fuel vehicle purchase, the vehicle must be operated at the same emission level for which the vehicle generated CFFV credit.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit generation.</E> (1) States shall grant CFFV credits to a covered fleet owner for any of the following qualifying CFFV purchases:</P>
              <P>(i) Purchase of a CFFV during any period subsequent to the approval of the SIP revision but prior to the effective date for commencement of a state's CFFV purchase requirement if the purchase meets all other CFFV requirements applicable to such purchases, including the statutory requirement to use only the fuel on which the vehicle was certified as a CFFV;</P>

              <P>(2) A state may retroactively grant CFFV credit(s) to a fleet owner for the purchase of a CFFV prior to the approval of the state's SIP revision if the purchase met all CFFV credit program requirements applicable to such purchases, including:</P>
              <P>(i) The vehicle purchased would have to have been certified to CFFV emission standards;</P>
              <P>(ii) The vehicle purchased would have to have been a dedicated-fuel vehicle;</P>

              <P>(iii) If the vehicle purchased was not a dedicated-fuel vehicle, then the fleet owner would have to show that the vehicle had been operated only on the <PRTPAGE P="33"/>clean alternative fuel on which the vehicle had been certified as a CFFV.</P>
              <P>(3) For LDVs and LDTs, credit values shall be determined in accordance with Table C94-1. The state shall use Table C94-1 exclusively in determining LDV and LDT CFFV credit values.

              <P>(4) In lieu of determining credit values in accordance with Table C94-1, a state may specify in its SIP revision that Table C94-2 will be used to determine LDV and LDT CFFV credit values in one or more affected nonattainment areas. Any state choosing to do so must provide adequate justification, based on air quality benefits, at the time the SIP revision is submitted. If the use of Table C94-2 is approved by EPA, the State shall use Table C94-2 exclusively in determining LDV and LDT CFFV credit values for vehicles in the subject area or areas. Table C94-2.1 applies to paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii) and (iv) of this section; Table C94-2.2 applies to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) In lieu of determining credit values in accordance with Table C94-1, a state containing a carbon monoxide nonattainment area(s) having a design value above 16.0 parts per million may specify in its SIP revision that Table C94-3 will be used to determine LDV and LDT CFFV credit values in one or more affected nonattainment areas. Any state choosing to do so must provide adequate justification, based on air quality benefits, at the time the SIP revision is submitted. If the use of Table C94-3 is approved by EPA, the state shall use Table C94-3 exclusively in determining LDV and LDT CFFV credit values for vehicles in the subject area or areas.

              <P>(6) For HDVs, credit values shall be determined in accordance with Table C94-4. The state shall use Table C94-4 exclusively in determining heavy-duty vehicle CFFV credit values. Table C94-4.1 applies to paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii) and (iv) of this section, and Table C94-4.2 applies to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) In lieu of determining credit values in accordance with Table C94-4, a state containing a carbon monoxide nonattainment area(s) having a design value above 16 parts per million may specify in its SIP revision that Table C94-5 will be used to determine heavy-duty vehicle CFFV credit values in one or more affected nonattainment areas. Any state choosing to do so must provide adequate justification, based on air quality benefits, at the time the SIP revision is submitted. If the use of Table C94-5 is approved by EPA, the State shall use Table C94-5 exclusively in determining heavy-duty vehicle CFFV credit values for vehicles in the subject area or areas. Table C94-5.1 applies to paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii) and (iv) of this section; Table C94-5.2 applies to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) Credit values shall be rounded to two decimal places.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Heavy heavy-duty vehicles.</E> (i) States must allow purchase of any clean-fuel single-unit or combination HDV with a GVWR greater than 26,000 pounds (11,800 kilograms) to generate CFFV credit for the fleet vehicle purchaser.</P>
              <P>(ii) States must exclude from generating CFFV credit the purchase of any combination HDV with a GVWR greater than 26,000 pounds (11,800 kilograms) which pays all or a portion of its fuel taxes, as evidenced by fuel tax stickers on the combination HDV, to a state(s) which is not part of that covered nonattainment area.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Light-duty CFFV credits.</E> Credits generated by the purchase of a qualifying clean-fuel fleet LDV or a LDT shall be designated at the time of issuance as light-duty CFFV credits.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements for a converted vehicle to qualify as a clean-fuel fleet vehicle.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of meeting the requirements of section 246 of the Clean Air Act or the SIP revisions, conversions of engines or vehicles which satisfy the requirements of this section shall be treated as a purchase of a clean-fuel vehicle under subpart C of this part.</P>

              <P>(b) The engine or vehicle must be converted using a conversion configuration which has been certified according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 86 using applicable emission standards and other provisions from part 88 for clean-fuel engines and vehicles. The following requirements will also apply:<PRTPAGE P="35"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) If the installation of the certified conversion configuration is performed by an entity other than aftermarket conversion certifier, the aftermarket conversion certifier shall submit a list of such installers to the Administrator. Additional installers must be added to this list and the revised list submitted to the Administrator within 5 working days from the time they are authorized to perform conversion installations by the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier.</P>
              <P>(2) If the installation of the certified conversion configuration is performed by an entity other than the certificate holder, the certificate holder shall provide instructions for installation of the aftermarket conversion system to installers listed on the certificate, and ensure that the systems are properly installed.</P>
              <P>(3) For the purpose of determining whether certification under the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 86.094-14 is permitted, the 10,000 sales volume limit in 40 CFR 86.094-14(b)(1) is waived for a certifier of a clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion.</P>
              <P>(4) Clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifiers that are subject to the post-installation emissions testing requirements in paragraph (c) of this section and who will satisfy these requirements by using the two speed idle test procedure detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section must conduct the following testing at the time of certification in order to generate the required certification CO emissions reference values. The certification CO emissions reference values generated must be submitted to the Administrator at the time of application for certification.</P>
              <P>(i) For dual and flexible fuel vehicles, certification reference values must be generated for each certification test fuel required for exhaust emissions testing pursuant to 40 CFR 86.113 or 40 CFR 86.1313.</P>
              <P>(ii) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the test fuels used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR 86.113. For heavy-duty engines the test fuels used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR 86.1313.</P>
              <P>(iii) Single, consecutive idle mode and high-speed mode segments of the two speed idle test must be conducted pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 85.2215 and as modified by the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and this paragraph to determine the required certification CO emission reference values.</P>
              <P>(A) The certification CO emission reference value for the idle mode of the test will be the simple average of all emissions measurements taken during an idle mode of 90 seconds duration pursuant to the requirements in 40 CFR 85.2215(a).</P>
              <P>(B) The certification CO emission reference value for the high-speed mode of the test will be the simple average of all emissions measurements taken during a high-speed mode of 180 seconds duration pursuant to the requirements in 40 CFR 85.2215(a).</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each converted vehicle manufactured by a clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with aggregate sales of less than 10,000 converted vehicles within a given calendar year must satisfy the post-installation emissions testing requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If a vehicle fails to satisfy the emissions testing requirements such vehicle may not be considered a clean- fuel vehicle until such noncompliance is rectified and compliance is demonstrated.</P>

              <P>(1) A clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with estimated sales of 300 or fewer engines and vehicles in a calendar year and which sells or converts vehicles outside of a non-attainment area (as classified under subpart D of Title I) which has an inspection and maintenance program that includes a test of carbon monoxide emissions may submit a request to the Administrator for an exemption from the post-installation emission test requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. If granted, such an exemption would apply to converted vehicles that <PRTPAGE P="36"/>have the conversion installation performed outside of a nonattainment area which has an inspection and maintenance program that includes a test of carbon monoxide emissions.</P>
              <P>(i) The request for exemption submitted to the Administrator must include the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The estimated number of engines and vehicles that will be converted in the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(B) Sufficient information to demonstrate that complying with the post-installation emission test requirement represents a severe financial hardship.</P>
              <P>(C) A description of any emission related quality control procedures used.</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 120 days of receipt of the application for exemption, the Administrator will notify the applicant either that an exemption is granted or that sufficient cause for an exemption has not been demonstrated and that all of the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier's vehicles are subject to the post-installation test requirement of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier granted an exemption originally estimates that 300 or fewer conversions would be performed in the calendar year, and then later revises the estimate to more than 300 for the year, the certifier shall inform the Administrator of such revision. A post-installation emissions test for each conversion performed after the estimate is revised is required pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The estimated number of conversions from such a clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier must be greater than 300 in the following calendar year.</P>
              <P>(2) A clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with aggregate sales less than 10,000 converted vehicles within a given calendar year shall conduct post-installation emissions testing using either of the following test methods:</P>
              <P>(i) The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the converted vehicle must be determined in the manner in which CO emissions are determined according to the inspection and maintenance requirements applicable in the area in which the vehicle is converted or is expected to be operated.</P>
              <P>(A) For dual-fuel vehicles, a separate test is required for each fuel on which the vehicle is capable of operating. For flexible fuel vehicles, a single test is required on a fuel that falls within the range of fuel mixtures for which the vehicle was designed. The test fuel(s) used must be commercially available.</P>
              <P>(B) A converted vehicle shall be considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph if the vehicle's measured exhaust CO concentration(s) is lower than the cutpoint(s) used to determine CO pass/fail under the inspection and maintenance program in the area in which the conversion is expected to be operated.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If CO pass/fail criteria are not available for a vehicle fuel type then pass/fail criteria specific to gasoline use are to be used for vehicles of that fuel type.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(ii) The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the converted vehicle must be determined in the manner specified in the two speed idle test-EPA 91 found in 40 CFR 85.2215. All provisions in the two speed idle test must be observed except as detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) For dual and flexible fuel vehicles, a separate test is required for each certification test fuel required for exhaust emissions testing pursuant to 40 CFR 86.113 or 40 CFR 86.1313.</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Testing of hydrocarbon emissions and equipment associated solely with hydrocarbon emissions testing is not required.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The CO emissions pass/fail criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215(a)(2), (c)(1)(ii)(A), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>), (c)(2)(iii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>), and (d)(3)(i) are to be replaced with the pass/fail criteria detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. All HC pass/fail criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215 do not apply.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The void test criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215(a)(3) and (b)(2)(iv) associated with maintaining the measured concentration of CO plus CO<E T="52">2</E> above six percent does not apply. However, the Administrator may reconsider requiring that the void test criteria in 40 CFR 85.2215(a)(3) and (b)(2)(iv) be applied, and may issue an advisory memorandum to this effect in the future.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4)</E> The ambient temperature levels encountered by the vehicle during testing must comply with the specifications in 40 CFR 86.130 or 40 CFR 86.1330.</P>
              <P>(d) The clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier shall be considered a manufacturer for purposes of Clean Air Act sections 206 and 207 and related enforcement provisions, and must accept liability for in-use performance of all the vehicles produced under the certificate of conformity as outlined in 40 CFR part 85.</P>
              <P>(1) The useful life period for the purposes of determining the in-use liability of the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier shall be the original useful life of the vehicle prior to conversion.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Inherently Low-Emission Vehicle labeling.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Label design.</E> (1) Label design shall consist of either of the following specifications:</P>
              <P>(i) The label shall consist of a white rectangular background, approximately 12 inches (30 centimeters) high by 18 inches (45 centimeters) wide, with “CLEAN AIR VEHICLE” printed in contrasting block capital letters at least 4.3 inches (10.6 centimeters) tall and 1.8 inches (4.4 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 0.5 inches (1.3 centimeters). In addition, the words “INHERENTLY LOW-EMISSION VEHICLE” must be present in lettering no smaller than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which impairs readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification number; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The label shall consist of a white truncated-circular background, approximately 10 inches (25 centimeters) in diameter by 7 inches (17.5 centimeters) in height. The bottom edge of the truncated-circular background shall be approximately 2 inches (5 centimeters) from the center. The acronym “ILEV” shall be printed on the label in contrasting block capital letters at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) tall and 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 0.4 inches (1.0 centimeter). In addition, the words “CLEAN AIR VEHICLE” must be present in lettering no smaller than 0.8 inches (2.0 centimeters) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which impairs readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification number.</P>
              <P>(2) The ILEV label shall be fabricated or affixed to a vehicle in such a manner that its removal from the vehicle cannot be accomplished without defacing or destroying the label in whole or in part.</P>
              <P>(3) Along with the manufacturer's application to certify a particular ILEV engine class, the manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent shall submit to EPA ILEV labels or reasonable facsimiles of the types which may be mounted on a certified ILEV vehicle of that class.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> Vehicle manufacturers or their agents must install ILEV labels on a certified ILEV vehicle at the time of its sale to an eligible fleet owner if the vehicle is to be eligible for expanded TCM exemptions. An eligible fleet owner is one who is in a covered area and owns a total of at least ten motor vehicles (including the ILEV(s) being purchased) which operate in the owner's fleet. All of the following shall be provided to demonstrate eligibility: Photocopies of no less than nine motor vehicle registrations indicating registration in the ILEV purchaser's name, a signed statement by the ILEV purchaser that these vehicles are operational in the purchaser's fleet and that the ILEV being purchased will also be operated in this fleet, and a signed statement by the ILEV purchaser that the ILEV labels will be removed and disposed of when the vehicle is sold, given, leased (except as part of a daily rental fleet), or offered for long-term loan to someone who has not demonstrated eligibility for expanded TCMs available to ILEVs according to these criteria.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">ILEV Label installation.</E> (1) Except as provided for in this paragraph (c), no person shall attach an ILEV label or any facsimile of an ILEV label to any vehicle.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) The manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent shall attach three labels on the vehicle in plain sight: One on the rear of the vehicle and one on each of two sides of the vehicle. Each label shall conform to the specifications of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case that an ILEV label of the proportions specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section cannot be attached to the rear of the ILEV, the manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent shall attach to the rear of the vehicle an ILEV label of either of the following proportions:</P>

              <P>(A) The label shall consist of a white rectangular background, approximately 4 inches (10 centimeters) high by 24 inches (60 centimeters) wide, with “CLEAN AIR VEHICLE” printed in contrasting block capital letters at least 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) tall and 1.3 inches (3.3 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 0.3 inches (0.8 centimeter). In addition, the words “INHERENTLY LOW-EMISSION VEHICLE” must be present in lettering <PRTPAGE P="41"/>no smaller than 0.6 inches (1.5 centimeters) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which impairs readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification number; or</P>
              <P>(B) The label shall consist of a white truncated-circular background, approximately 5 inches (12.5 centimeters) in diameter by 3.5 inches (8.8 centimeters) in height. The bottom edge of the truncated-circular background shall be approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from the center. The acronym “ILEV” shall be printed on the label in contrasting block capital letters at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) tall and 0.8 inches (2.0 centimeters) wide with a stroke width not less than 0.3 inches (0.8 centimeters). In addition, the words “CLEAN AIR VEHICLE” must be present in lettering no smaller than 0.4 inches (1.0 centimeter) high. Nothing shall be added to the label which impairs readability. Labels shall include a serialized identification number.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Label removal.</E> Fleet ILEV owners shall remove and dispose of the ILEV labels on a vehicle before selling or transferring ownership of an ILEV or offering it for lease (unless the ILEV is part of a daily rental fleet) or long-term loan. This provision shall not apply if the person who is receiving the vehicle demonstrates eligibility for expanded TCM exemptions under the federal ILEV program as described in paragraph (b) of this section, or is otherwise qualified under state regulations which expressly expand ILEV label eligibility.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Label replacement.</E> (1) The manufacturer shall make replacement ILEV labels available to the fleet owner of a qualifying ILEV to replace any ILEV label which has been lost or removed due to vehicle damage, repair, sale, or lease. The fleet owner's request shall include proof of ownership of the ILEV in question and proof of the fleet owner's eligibility for ILEV TCM exemptions, as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section. Each label shall be imprinted with the same serial number as initially assigned to the damaged/missing ILEV label(s) for that vehicle. Any portion of a damaged label remaining on the ILEV shall be removed from the vehicle and submitted with the request as proof of loss.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon receipt of the replacement ILEV label(s), the fleet owner shall attach the new ILEV label(s) only to the vehicle for which replacement ILEV label(s) were requested.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Incentives for the purchase of Inherently Low-Emission Vehicles.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Administration.</E> (1) The incentives granted to ILEVs provided in this section are not effective outside of nonattainment areas for which states are required to establish CFFV programs under section 246 of the CAA, unless specifically added by states for qualifying vehicles.</P>
              <P>(2) Incentives for purchasing ILEVs shall not be transferred between vehicles within the same fleet nor shall they be sold or traded.</P>
              <P>(3) No vehicle over 26,000 pounds (11,800 kilograms) GVWR shall be eligible for the following ILEV incentives.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemption from temporal TCMs.</E> A fleet vehicle which has been certified and labeled as an ILEV according to the provisions of this section and which continues to be in compliance with applicable emissions standards and other ILEV program requirements shall be exempted from TCMs existing for air quality reasons included in approved state implementation plans which restrict vehicle usage based primarily on temporal considerations, such as time-of-day and day-of-week exemptions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemption from high-occupancy vehicle lane restrictions.</E> (1) A fleet vehicle which has been certified and labeled as an ILEV according to the provisions of §§ 88.311 and 88.312 and which continues to be in compliance with applicable emissions standards and other ILEV program requirements shall be exempt from TCMs which restrict a vehicle's access to certain roadway lanes based on the number of occupants in that vehicle, usually known as high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. These exemptions shall not apply if they would create a clear and direct safety hazard.<PRTPAGE P="42"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) In a state containing a covered area, or areas, the governor may petition the Administrator for a waiver from the exemption from HOV lane restrictions for ILEVs for any section of HOV lane in the covered area(s) that can be shown to be congested primarily due to the operation or projected operation of ILEVs. The waiver application shall demonstrate the infeasibility of other means of alleviating HOV/CAV lane congestion, such as adding an additional HOV/CAV lane, further increasing vehicle occupancy requirements and reducing the use of the lane by noneligible vehicles.</P>

              <P>This appendix sets forth the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) interpretation of the Clean Air Act regarding the authority of states to regulate the use and operation of nonroad engines.</P>
              <P>EPA believes that states are not precluded under section 209 from regulating the use and operation of nonroad engines, such as regulations on hours of usage, daily mass emission limits, or sulfur limits on fuel; nor are permits regulating such operations precluded, once the engine is no longer new. EPA believes that states are precluded from requiring retrofitting of used nonroad engines except that states are permitted to adopt and enforce any such retrofitting requirements identical to California requirements which have been authorized by EPA under section 209 of the Clean Air Act.</P>

              <P>(c) Engines meeting the voluntary standards described in § 89.112(f) may be designated as Blue Sky Series engines through the 2004 model year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Implementation flexibility for equipment and vehicle manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers.</E> Nonroad equipment and vehicle manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers may take any of the otherwise prohibited actions identified in § 89.1003(a)(1) and (b)(4) with respect to nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines, subject to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. The following allowances apply separately to each engine power category subject to standards under § 89.112:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Percent-of-production allowances </E>— (i) <E T="03">Equipment rated at or above 37 kW.</E> For nonroad equipment and vehicles with engines rated at or above 37 kW, a manufacturer may take any of the actions identified in § 89.1003(a)(1) for a portion of its U.S.-directed production volume of such equipment and vehicles during the seven years immediately following the date on which Tier 2 engine standards first apply to engines used in such equipment and vehicles, provided that the seven-year sum of <PRTPAGE P="54"/>these portions in each year, as expressed as a percentage for each year, does not exceed 80, and provided that all such equipment and vehicles or equipment contain Tier 1 or Tier 2 engines;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Equipment rated under 37 kW.</E> For nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines with engines rated under 37 kW, a manufacturer may take any of the actions identified in § 89.1003(a)(1) for a portion of its U.S.-directed production volume of such equipment and vehicles during the seven years immediately following the date on which Tier 1 engine standards first apply to engines used in such equipment and vehicles, provided that the seven-year sum of these portions in each year, as expressed as a percentage for each year, does not exceed 80.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Small volume allowances.</E> A nonroad equipment or vehicle manufacturer or post-manufacture marinizer may exceed the production percentages in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, provided that in each regulated power category the manufacturer's total of excepted nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines:</P>
              <P>(i) Over the years in which the percent-of-production allowance applies does not exceed 100 units times the number of years in which the percent-of-production allowance applies; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Does not exceed 200 units in any year; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Does not use engines from more than one engine family, or, for excepted equipment vehicles, and marine diesel engines using engines not belonging to any engine family, from more than one engine manufacturer. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii), engine family refers to engines that have common characteristics as described in § 89.116.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Inclusion of previous-tier engines.</E> Nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines built with previous tier or noncertified engines under the existing inventory provisions of § 89.1003(b)(4) need not be included in determining compliance with paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Recordkeeping and calculation to verify compliance.</E> The following shall apply to nonroad equipment or vehicle manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers who produce excepted equipment or vehicles or marine diesel engines under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) For each power category in which excepted nonroad equipment or vehicles or marine diesel engines are produced, a calculation to verify compliance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section shall be made by the nonroad equipment or vehicle manufacturer or post-manufacture marinizer. This calculation shall be made no later than December 31 of the year following the last year in which allowances are used, and shall be based on actual production information from the subject years. If both the percent-of-production and small volume allowances have been exceeded, then the manufacturer is in violation of section 203 of the Act and § 89.1003, except as provided under paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) A nonroad equipment or vehicle manufacturer or post-manufacture marinizer shall keep records of all nonroad equipment and vehicles and marine diesel engines excepted under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, for each power category in which exceptions are taken. These records shall include equipment and engine model numbers, serial numbers, and dates of manufacture, and engine rated power. In addition, the manufacturer shall keep records sufficient to demonstrate the verifications of compliance required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. All records shall be kept until at least two full years after the final year in which allowances are available for each power category, and shall be made available to EPA upon request.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Hardship relief.</E> Nonroad equipment and vehicle manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers may take any of the otherwise prohibited actions identified in § 89.1003(a)(1) if approved by the Administrator, and subject to the following requirements:</P>

              <P>(1) Application for relief must be submitted to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of the EPA in writing prior to the earliest date in which the applying manufacturer would be in violation of § 89.1003. The manufacturer must submit evidence <PRTPAGE P="55"/>showing that the requirements for approval have been met.</P>
              <P>(2) The applying manufacturer must not be the manufacturer of the engines used in the equipment for which relief is sought. This requirement does not apply to post-manufacture marinizers.</P>
              <P>(3) The conditions causing the impending violation must not be substantially the fault of the applying manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(4) The conditions causing the impending violation must be such that the applying manufacturer will experience serious economic hardship if relief is not granted.</P>
              <P>(5) The applying manufacturer must demonstrate that no allowances under paragraph (d) of this section will be available to avoid the impending violation.</P>
              <P>(6) Any relief granted must begin within one year after the implementation date of the standard applying to the engines being used in the equipment, or to the marine diesel engines, for which relief is requested, and may not exceed one year in duration.</P>
              <P>(7) The Administrator may impose other conditions on the granting of relief including provisions to recover the lost environmental benefit.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Allowance for the production of engines.</E> Engine manufacturers may take any of the otherwise prohibited actions identified in § 89.1003(a)(1) with regard to uncertified engines, Tier 1 engines, or Tier 2 engines, as appropriate, if the engine manufacturer has received written assurance from the equipment manufacturer that the engine is required to meet the demand for engines created under paragraph (d), (f), or (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Alternative Flexibility for Post-Manufacture Marinizers.</E> Post-manufacture marinizers may elect to delay the effective date of the Tier 1 standards in § 89.112 for marine diesel engines rated under 37 kW by one year, instead of using the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section. Post-manufacture marinizers wishing to take advantage of this provision must inform the Director of the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of their intent to do so in writing before the date that the standards would otherwise take effect.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Additional exemptions for technical or engineering hardship.</E> You may request additional engine allowances under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for 56-560 kW power categories or, if you are a small equipment manufacturer, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for engines at or above 37 and below 75 kW. However, you may use these extra allowances only for those equipment models for which you, or an affiliated company, do not also produce the engine. After considering the circumstances, we may permit you to introduce into U.S. commerce equipment with such engines that do not comply with Tier 3 emission standards, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) We may approve additional exemptions if extreme and unusual circumstances that are clearly outside your control and that could not have been avoided with reasonable discretion have resulted in technical or engineering problems that prevent you from meeting the requirements of this part. You must show that you exercised prudent planning and have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the scope of your request for additional allowances.</P>
              <P>(2) To apply for exemptions under this paragraph (i), send the Designated Compliance Officer and the Designated Enforcement Officer a written request as soon as possible before you are in violation. In your request, include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Describe your process for designing equipment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Describe how you normally work cooperatively or concurrently with your engine supplier to design products.</P>
              <P>(iii) Describe the engineering or technical problems causing you to request the exemption and explain why you have not been able to solve them. Describe the extreme and unusual circumstances that led to these problems and explain how they were unavoidable.</P>

              <P>(iv) Describe any information or products you received from your engine supplier related to equipment design—such as written specifications, performance data, or prototype engines—and when you received it.<PRTPAGE P="56"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) Compare the design processes of the equipment model for which you need additional exemptions and that for other models for which you do not need additional exemptions. Explain the technical differences that justify your request.</P>
              <P>(vi) Describe your efforts to find and use other compliant engines, or otherwise explain why none is available.</P>
              <P>(vii) Describe the steps you have taken to minimize the scope of your request.</P>
              <P>(viii) Include other relevant information. You must give us other relevant information if we ask for it.</P>
              <P>(ix) Estimate the increased percent of production you need for each equipment model covered by your request, as described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. Estimate the increased number of allowances you need for each equipment model covered by your request, as described in paragraph (i)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) We may approve your request to increase the allowances under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, subject to the following limitations:</P>
              <P>(i) The additional allowances will not exceed 50 percent for each power category.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must use up the allowances under paragraph (d)(1) of this section before using any additional allowance under this paragraph (i).</P>
              <P>(iii) Any allowances we approve under this paragraph (i)(3) expire 24 months after the provisions of this section start for a given power category. You may use these allowances only for the specific equipment models covered by your request.</P>
              <P>(4) We may approve your request to increase the allowances for the 37-75 kW power category under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, subject to the following limitations:</P>
              <P>(i) You are eligible for additional allowances under this paragraph (i)(4) only if you are a small equipment manufacturer and you do not use the provisions of paragraph (i)(3) of this section to obtain additional allowances for the 37-75 kW power category.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must use up all the available allowances for the 37-75 kW power category under paragraph (d)(2) of this section in a given year before using any additional allowances under this paragraph (i)(4).</P>
              <P>(iii) Base your request only on equipment you produce with engines at or above 37 kW and below 75 kW. You may use any additional allowances only for equipment you produce with engines at or above 37 kW and below 75 kW.</P>
              <P>(iv) Any allowances we approve under this paragraph (i)(4) expire 24 months after the provisions of this section start for this power category. These additional allowances are not subject to the annual limits specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. You may use these allowances only for the specific equipment models covered by your request.</P>
              <P>(v) The total allowances under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the 37-75 kW power category will not exceed 700 units. The total allowances under this paragraph (i)(4) follow the requirements under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for the 37-75 kW power category and will not exceed 200 units. Therefore, the total maximum allowances for the 37-75 kW power category will not exceed 900 units.</P>
              <P>(5) For purposes of this paragraph (i), small equipment manufacturer means an equipment manufacturer that had annual U.S.-directed production volume of equipment using nonroad diesel engines between 37 and 75 kW of no more than 3,000 units in 2002 and all earlier calendar years, and has 750 or fewer employees (500 or fewer employees for nonroad equipment manufacturers that produce no construction equipment or industrial trucks). For manufacturers owned by a parent company, the production limit applies to the production of the parent company and all its subsidiaries and the employee limit applies to the total number of employees of the parent company and all its subsidiaries.</P>
              <P>(6) The following provisions for adjusted flexibilities for Tier 4 engines apply to equipment manufacturers that are granted additional exemptions for technical or engineering hardship:</P>

              <P>(i) If you use the additional allowance under this paragraph (i) you shall forfeit percent of production flexibility plus technical or engineering hardship exemptions available for Tier 4 engines <PRTPAGE P="57"/>in the amounts shown in Table 1 of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Table 1 of this section shows the percent of production flexibility and technical or engineering hardship exemptions that you must forfeit for Tier 4 engines. The amount of Tier 4 flexibility forfeited by each equipment manufacturer depends on the percent of production flexibility used for Tier 2 engines and the technical or engineering hardship exemptions granted for Tier 3 engines in the proportions shown in Table 1. For example, if you used 45 percent of your production flexibility for Tier 2 engines, you must forfeit 2 percent of your production flexibility for Tier 4 engines for every 1 percent of technical or engineering hardship flexibility granted for Tier 3 engines. In addition you must also forfeit 1 percent of any technical or engineering hardship exemptions available for Tier 4 engines for every 1 percent technical or engineering hardship exemptions available for Tier 3 engines. If you use the Tier 3 technical or engineering hardship allowances for 5 percent of your equipment in each of two different years, you have used a total allowance of 10 percent. Therefore you must forfeit a total of 20 percent of production flexibility for Tier 4 engines plus 10 percent of any technical or engineering hardship exemptions available for Tier 4 engines.</P>

              <P>(iii) Because the Tier 3 and Tier 4 rules have different power category ranges, the availability of technical relief will be further adjusted based on the sales volume by power category. Table 2 of this section shows the applicable power categories for Tier 3 and Tier 4. The Tier 3 power categories of 37kW to 75kW and 75kW to 130kW correspond to the Tier 4 power category of 56kW to 130kW. For the Tier 3 equipment in the 37 to 75kW category, you must only use the sales volume for equipment that uses engines with a rated power greater than 56kW. For example, if you have a Tier 3 piece of equipment that uses a 40 kW engine, the sales of the equipment are counted in the Tier 4 power category of 19kW to 56kW. If you have a Tier 3 piece of equipment that uses a 60kW engine, the sales of the equipment are counted in the Tier 4 power category of 56kW to 130kW. The Tier 3 power categories of 130kW to 225kW, 225kW to 450kW and 450kW to 560kW correspond to the Tier 4 power category of 130kW to 560kW. You will need to sum the sales of the Tier 3 power categories that correspond to the Tier 4 power category during each calendar year in which Tier 3 technical relief is used. The sum of all the Tier 3 units that are produced and exempted by the technical relief divided by the sum of all the Tier 3 units sold in the corresponding Tier 4 power category will determine the percentage of Tier 4 flexibility affected. For example, if you produce 50 units using Tier 3 technical relief in the range of 130kW to 225kW, and you produce 50 units using Tier 3 technical relief in the range of 225 to 450kW, and no units are produced in the 450kW to 560kW range, and your overall sales volume for the power ranges of 130kW to 560kW in Tier 3 is 400 units, the amount of Tier 3 technical relief used is 100/400 or 25 percent. Because you forfeit 1 percent of your Tier 4 technical relief for every 1 percent of Tier 3 technical relief used, then you will lose 25 percent of your Tier 4 technical relief in the 130kW to 560kW power range category. If you used 45 percent of your production flexibility for Tier 2 engines, you must forfeit 2 percent of production flexibility for Tier 4 engines for every 1 percent of Tier 3 technical relief. Therefore, you will forfeit 50 percent of your Tier 4 production allowance in the 130kW to 560kW power range category.</P>

              <P>(a) The manufacturer must furnish or cause to be furnished to the ultimate purchaser of each new nonroad engine subject to standards under this part written instructions for the maintenance needed to ensure proper functioning of the emission control system. Paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section do not apply to Tier 1 engines with rated power at or above 37 kW.</P>
              <P>(b) Maintenance performed on equipment, engines, subsystems or components used to determine exhaust emission deterioration factors is classified as either emission-related or nonemission-related and each of these can be classified as either scheduled or unscheduled. Further, some emission-related maintenance is also classified as critical emission-related maintenance.</P>
              <P>(c) This paragraph (c) specifies emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of obtaining durability data for nonroad engines. The maintenance intervals specified below are minimum intervals:</P>
              <P>(1) All emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of obtaining durability data must occur at the same or longer hours of use intervals as those specified in the manufacturer's maintenance instructions furnished to the ultimate purchaser of the engine under paragraph (a) of this section. This maintenance schedule may be updated as necessary throughout the testing of the engine, provided that no maintenance operation is deleted from the maintenance schedule after the operation has been performed on the test equipment or engine.</P>

              <P>(2) Any emission-related maintenance which is performed on equipment, engines, subsystems, or components must be technologically necessary to ensure in-use compliance with the emission standards. The manufacturer must submit data which demonstrate to the Administrator that <PRTPAGE P="61"/>all of the emission-related scheduled maintenance which is to be performed is technologically necessary. Scheduled maintenance must be approved by the Administrator prior to being performed or being included in the maintenance instructions provided to the purchasers under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The Administrator may require longer maintenance intervals than those listed in paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section where the listed intervals are not technologically necessary.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator may allow manufacturers to specify shorter maintenance intervals than those listed in paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section where technologically necessary for engines rated under 19 kW, or for constant speed engines rated under 37 kW with rated speeds greater than or equal to 3,000 rpm.</P>
              <P>(3) The adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of items listed in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this section shall occur at 1,500 hours of use and at 1,500-hour intervals thereafter.</P>

              <P>(vi) Catalytic convertor.</P>
              <P>(vii) Any other add-on emission-related component (i.e., a component whose sole or primary purpose is to reduce emissions or whose failure will significantly degrade emission control and whose function is not integral to the design and performance of the engine).</P>
              <P>(d) Scheduled maintenance not related to emissions which is reasonable and technologically necessary (e.g., oil change, oil filter change, fuel filter change, air filter change, cooling system maintenance, adjustment of idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, injector lash, timing, lubrication of the exhaust manifold heat control valve, etc.) may be performed on durability vehicles at the least frequent intervals recommended by the manufacturer to the ultimate purchaser, (e.g., not the intervals recommended for severe service).</P>
              <P>(e) Adjustment of engine idle speed on emission data engines may be performed once before the low-hour emission test point. Any other engine, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on emission data vehicles shall be performed only with advance approval of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(f) Equipment, instruments, or tools may not be used to identify malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools will be available to dealerships and other service outlets and:</P>
              <P>(1) Are used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such components; or</P>
              <P>(2) Are used subsequent to the identification of a vehicle or engine malfunction, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section for emission data engines; or</P>
              <P>(3) Specifically authorized by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(g) All test data, maintenance reports, and required engineering reports shall be compiled and provided to the Administrator in accordance with § 89.124.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) The components listed in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(vi) of this section are defined as critical emission-related components.</P>

              <P>(v) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system.</P>
              <P>(vi) Any other add-on emission-related component (i.e., a component whose sole or primary purpose is to reduce emissions or whose failure will significantly degrade emission control and whose function is not integral to the design and performance of the engine).</P>
              <P>(2) All critical emission-related scheduled maintenance must have a reasonable likelihood of being performed in use. The manufacturer must show the reasonable likelihood of such maintenance being performed in-use. Critical emission-related scheduled maintenance items which satisfy one of the conditions defined in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (h)(2)(vi) of this section will be accepted as having a reasonable likelihood of being performed in use.</P>
              <P>(i) Data are presented which establish for the Administrator a connection between emissions and vehicle performance such that as emissions increase due to lack of maintenance, vehicle performance will simultaneously deteriorate to a point unacceptable for typical operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Survey data are submitted which adequately demonstrate to the Administrator with an 80 percent confidence level that 80 percent of such engines already have this critical maintenance item performed in-use at the recommended interval(s).</P>
              <P>(iii) A clearly displayed visible signal system approved by the Administrator is installed to alert the equipment operator that maintenance is due. A signal bearing the message “maintenance needed” or “check engine,” or a similar message approved by the Administrator, shall be actuated at the appropriate usage point or by component failure. This signal must be continuous while the engine is in operation and not be easily eliminated without performance of the required maintenance. Resetting the signal shall be a required step in the maintenance operation. The method for resetting the signal system shall be approved by the Administrator. The system must not be designed to deactivate upon the end of the useful life of the engine or thereafter.</P>
              <P>(iv) A manufacturer may desire to demonstrate through a survey that a critical maintenance item is likely to be performed without a visible signal on a maintenance item for which there is no prior in-use experience without the signal. To that end, the manufacturer may in a given model year market up to 200 randomly selected vehicles per critical emission-related maintenance item without such visible signals, and monitor the performance of the critical maintenance item by the owners to show compliance with paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section. This option is restricted to two consecutive model years and may not be repeated until any previous survey has been completed. If the critical maintenance involves more than one engine family, the sample will be sales weighted to ensure that it is representative of all the families in question.</P>
              <P>(v) The manufacturer provides the maintenance free of charge, and clearly informs the customer that the maintenance is free in the instructions provided under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) The manufacturer uses any other method which the Administrator approves as establishing a reasonable likelihood that the critical maintenance will be performed in-use.</P>
              <P>(3) Visible signal systems used under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section are considered an element of design of the emission control system. Therefore, disabling, resetting, or otherwise rendering such signals inoperative without also performing the indicated maintenance procedure is a prohibited act.</P>

              <P>(a) If all test engines representing an engine family have emissions less than or equal to each emission standard, that family complies with the emission standards.</P>
              <P>(b) If any test engine representing an engine family has emissions greater than each emission standard, that family will be deemed not in compliance with the emission standard(s).</P>
              <P>(c) For each nonroad engine family, except Tier 1 engine families with rated power at or above 37 kW that do not employ aftertreatment, a deterioration factor must be determined and applied.</P>
              <P>(1) The applicable exhaust emission standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) for nonroad compression-ignition engines apply to the emissions of engines for their useful life.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(3)(i) This paragraph (c)(3) describes the procedure for determining compliance of an engine with emission standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), based on deterioration factors supplied by the manufacturer. The NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> deterioration factors shall be established based on the sum of the pollutants, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. When establishing deterioration factors for NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>. a negative deterioration (emissions decrease from the official emissions test result) for one pollutant may not offset deterioration of the other pollutant.</P>

              <P>(ii) Separate emission deterioration factors, determined by the manufacturer according to the requirements of § 89.118, shall be provided in the certification application for each engine-system combination. Separate deterioration factors shall be established for each regulated pollutant, except that a combined NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> deterioration factor shall be established for compression-ignition nonroad engines not utilizing aftertreatment technology. For smoke testing, separate deterioration factors shall also be established for the acceleration mode (designated as “A”), the lugging mode (designated as “B”), and peak opacity (designated as “C”).</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Compression-ignition nonroad engines not utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., particulate traps).</E> For CO, NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>. and particulate, the official exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at the selected test point shall be adjusted by addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Compression-ignition nonroad engines utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., particulate traps).</E> For CO, NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>. and particulate, the official exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at the selected test point shall be adjusted by multiplication by the appropriate deterioration factor. Separate NMHC and NO<E T="52">X</E> deterioration factors shall be applied to the results for these pollutants prior to combining the results. If the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(iv).</P>

              <P>(v) For acceleration smoke (“A”), lugging smoke (“B”), and peak opacity (“C”), the official exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at <PRTPAGE P="73"/>the selected test point shall be adjusted by the addition of the appropriate deterioration factor. However if the deterioration supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(v).</P>
              <P>(vi) The emission values to compare with the standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted emission values of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) through (v) of this section, rounded to the same number of significant figures as contained in the applicable standard in accordance with ASTM E29-93a, for each emission data engine. This procedure has been incorporated by reference at § 89.6.</P>
              <P>(4) Every test engine of an engine family must comply with all applicable standards (or family emission limits, as appropriate), as determined in paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section, before any engine in that family will be certified.</P>
              <P>(d) For engine families included in the averaging, banking, and trading program, the families' emission limits (FELs) are used in lieu of the applicable federal emission standard.</P>
              <P>(e) For the purposes of setting an NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> certification level or FEL, one of the following options shall be used for the determination of NMHC for an engine family. The manufacturer must declare which option is used in its application for certification of that engine family.</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer may assume that up to two percent of the measured THC is methane (NMHC = 0.98 × THC).</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer may measure NMHC emissions using a method approved by the Administrator prior to the start of testing. This option allows the determination of NMHC emissions by subtracting measured methane emissions from measured THC emissions.</P>

              <P>(1) To inspect and monitor any part or aspect of such procedures, activities, and testing facilities, including, but not limited to, monitoring engine preconditioning, emission tests and service accumulation, maintenance, and engine storage procedures, and to verify correlation or calibration of test equipment;</P>
              <P>(2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, designs, or other documents; and</P>
              <P>(3) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any such certification engine and any components to be used in the construction thereof.</P>

              <P>(c) To allow the Administrator to determine whether production engines conform in all material respects to the design specifications applicable to those engines, as described in the application for certification for which a certificate of conformity has been issued, any manufacturer shall admit any EPA <PRTPAGE P="78"/>enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative on presentation of credentials to:</P>
              <P>(1) Any facility where any document, design, or procedure relating to the translation of the design and construction of engines and emission-related components described in the application for certification or used for certification testing into production engines is located or carried on; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any facility where any engines to be introduced into commerce are manufactured or assembled.</P>
              <P>(d) On admission to any such facility referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative shall be allowed:</P>
              <P>(1) To inspect and monitor any aspects of such manufacture or assembly and other procedures;</P>
              <P>(2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, documents or designs; and</P>

              <P>(e) Any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative shall be furnished by those in charge of a facility being inspected with such reasonable assistance as he or she may request to help the enforcement officer or authorized representative discharge any function listed in this paragraph. Each applicant for or recipient of certification is required to cause those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without charge to EPA whether or not the applicant controls the facility.</P>
              <P>(1) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services; the making available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform the EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative of how the facility operates and to answer the officer's questions; and the performance on request of emission tests on any engine which is being, has been, or will be used for certification testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may require appropriate service accumulation.</P>
              <P>(2) A manufacturer may be compelled to cause any employee at a facility being inspected to appear before an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative. The request for the employee's appearance shall be in writing, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, and served on the manufacturer. Any employee who has been instructed by the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel.</P>
              <P>(f) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative applies whether or not the applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to domestic and to foreign manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to do what is necessary to ensure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no informed judgment that an engine is certifiable or is covered by a certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to locate its testing and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not arise.</P>
              <P>(g) Any entry without 24 hours prior written or oral notification to the affected manufacturer shall be authorized in writing by the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement.</P>

              <P>(a) The averaging, banking, and trading programs for NO<E T="52">X</E>. NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>. and PM emissions from eligible nonroad engines are described in this subpart. Participation in these programs is voluntary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements for Tier 1 engines rated at or above 37 kW.</E> (1) A nonroad engine family is eligible to participate in the averaging, banking, and trading program for NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions and the banking and trading program for PM emissions if it is subject to regulation under subpart B of this part with certain exceptions specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. No averaging, banking, and trading program is available for meeting the Tier 1 HC, CO, or smoke emission standards specified in subpart B of this part. No averaging program is available for meeting the Tier 1 PM emission standards specified in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Nonroad engines may not participate in the averaging, banking, and trading programs if they are exported or are sold as Blue Sky Series engines as described in § 89.112(f). Nonroad engines certified on a special test procedure under § 89.114(a), may not participate in the averaging, banking and trading programs unless the manufacturer has requested that the engines be included in the averaging, banking, and trading programs at the time the request for the special test procedure is made and has been granted approval by the Administrator for inclusion in the averaging, banking, and trading programs.</P>

              <P>(3) A manufacturer may certify one or more nonroad engine families at NO<E T="52">X</E> family emission limits (FELs) above or below the Tier 1 NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standard, provided the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all NO<E T="52">X</E> credit transactions in a given model year is greater than or equal to zero, as determined under § 89.207(a). A manufacturer may certify one or more nonroad engine families at PM FELs below the Tier 2 PM emission <PRTPAGE P="80"/>standard that will be applicable to those engine families.</P>
              <P>(i) FELs for NO<E T="52">X</E> may not exceed the Tier 1 upper limit specified in § 89.112(d).</P>
              <P>(ii) An engine family certified to an FEL is subject to all provisions specified in this part, except that the applicable FEL replaces the emission standard for the family participating in the averaging, banking, and trading program.</P>
              <P>(iii) A manufacturer of an engine family with a NO<E T="52">X</E> FEL exceeding the Tier 1 NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standard must obtain NO<E T="52">X</E> emission credits sufficient to address the associated credit shortfall via averaging, banking, or trading.</P>
              <P>(iv) An engine family with a NO<E T="52">X</E> FEL below the applicable Tier 1 standard may generate emission credits for averaging, banking, trading, or a combination thereof. An engine family with a PM FEL below the Tier 2 standard that will be applicable to that engine family may generate emission credits for banking, trading, or a combination thereof. Emission credits may not be used to offset an engine family's emissions that exceed its applicable FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) or by recall (in-use) testing. However, in the case of an SEA failure, credits may be used to allow subsequent production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.</P>
              <P>(4) NO<E T="52">X</E> credits generated in a given model year may be used to address credit shortfalls with other engines during that model year or in any subsequent model year except as noted under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. PM credits may be used to address credit shortfalls with Tier 2 and later engines greater than or equal to 37 kW and Tier 1 and later engines less than 37 kW and greater than or equal to 19 kW. Credits generated in one model year may not be used for prior model years.</P>

              <P>(5) The following provisions apply to the use of Tier 1 NO<E T="52">X</E> credits for showing compliance with the Tier 2 or Tier 3 NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> standards.</P>
              <P>(i) A manufacturer may use NO<E T="52">X</E> credits from engines subject to the Tier 1 NO<E T="52">X</E> standard to address NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> credit shortfalls with engines in the same averaging set subject to Tier 1 NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> or Tier 2 NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standards.</P>
              <P>(ii) A manufacturer may not use NO<E T="52">X</E> credits from engines subject to the Tier 1 standards to address NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> credit shortfalls with engines subject to the Tier 3 NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standards.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for Tier 2 and later engines rated at or above 37 kW and Tier 1 and later engines rated under 37 kW.</E> (1) A nonroad engine family is eligible to participate in the averaging, banking, and trading programs for NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions and PM emissions if it is subject to regulation under subpart B of this part with certain exceptions specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. No averaging, banking, and trading program is available for meeting the CO or smoke emission standards specified in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Nonroad engines may not participate in the averaging, banking, and trading programs if they are exported or are sold as Blue Sky Series engines as described in § 89.112(f). Nonroad engines certified on a special test procedure under § 89.114(a), may not participate in the averaging, banking and trading programs unless the manufacturer has requested that the engines be included in the averaging, banking, and trading programs at the time the request for the special test procedure is made and has been granted approval by the Administrator for inclusion in the averaging, banking, and trading programs.</P>

              <P>(3)(i) A manufacturer may certify one or more nonroad engine families at FELs above or below the applicable NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standard and PM emission standard, provided the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> credit transactions and the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all PM credit transactions in a given model year in a given averaging set is greater than or equal to zero, as determined under § 89.207(b).</P>
              <P>(A) FELs for NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and FELs for PM may not exceed the upper limits specified in § 89.112(d).<PRTPAGE P="81"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) An engine family certified to an FEL is subject to all provisions specified in this part, except that the applicable FEL replaces the emission standard for the family participating in the averaging, banking, and trading program.</P>

              <P>(D) An engine family with an FEL below the applicable standard may generate emission credits for averaging, banking, trading, or a combination thereof. Emission credits may not be used to offset an engine family's emissions that exceed its applicable FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) or by recall (in-use) testing. However, in the case of an SEA failure, credits may be used to allow subsequent production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.</P>

              <P>(ii)(A) In lieu of generating credits under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a manufacturer may certify one or more nonroad engine families rated under 37 kW at family emission limits (FELs) above or below the applicable NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standard and PM emission standard. The summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> credit transactions and the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all PM credit transactions in a given model year, as determined under § 89.207(b), are each allowed to be less than zero. Separate calculations shall be required for the following two categories of engines: engines rated under 19 kW and engines rated at or above 19 kW and under 37 kW.</P>
              <P>(B) For each calendar year a negative credit balance exists as of December 31, a penalty equal to ten percent of the negative credit balance as of December 31 of the calendar year shall be added to the negative credit balance. The resulting negative credit balance shall be carried into the next calendar year.</P>

              <P>(C) For engines rated under 19 kW, a manufacturer will be allowed to carry over a negative credit balance until December 31, 2003. For engines rated at or above 19 kW and under 37 kW, a manufacturer will be allowed to carry over a negative credit balance until December 31, 2002. As of these dates, the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> credit transactions and the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all PM credit transactions must each be greater than or equal to zero.</P>
              <P>(D) FELs for NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and FELs for PM may not exceed the upper limits specified in § 89.112(d).</P>

              <P>(E) An engine family certified to an FEL is subject to all provisions specified in this part, except that the applicable NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FEL or PM FEL replaces the NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standard or PM emission standard for the family participating in the averaging and banking program.</P>
              <P>(F) A manufacturer of an engine family with an FEL exceeding the applicable emission standard must obtain emission credits sufficient to address the associated credit shortfall via averaging or banking. The exchange of emission credits generated under this program with other nonroad engine manufacturers in trading is not allowed.</P>
              <P>(G) An engine family with an FEL below the applicable standard may generate emission credits for averaging, banking, or a combination thereof. Emission credits may not be used to offset an engine family's emissions that exceed its applicable FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) or by recall (in-use) testing. However, in the case of an SEA failure, credits may be used to allow subsequent production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.</P>

              <P>(4)(i) Except as noted in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii), (c)(4)(iii), and (c)(4)(iv) of this section, credits generated in a given model year may be used during that model year or used in any subsequent model year. Except as allowed under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="82"/>credits generated in one model year may not be used for prior model years.</P>
              <P>(ii) Credits generated from engines rated under 19 kW prior to the implementation date of the applicable Tier 2 standards, shall expire on December 31, 2007.</P>
              <P>(iii) Credits generated from engines rated under 19 kW under the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) shall expire on December 31, 2003.</P>
              <P>(iv) Credits generated from engines rated at or above 19 kW and under 37 kW under the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section shall expire on December 31, 2002.</P>
              <P>(5) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, engine families may not generate credits for one pollutant while also using credits for another pollutant in the same model year.</P>
              <P>(6) Model year 2008 and 2009 engines rated under 8 kW that are allowed to certify under this part because they meet the criteria in 40 CFR 1039.101(c) may not generate emission credits.</P>
              <P>(d) Manufacturers must demonstrate compliance under the averaging, banking, and trading programs for a particular model year within 270 days of the end of the model year. Except as allowed under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, manufacturers that have certified engine families to FELs above the applicable emission standards and do not have sufficient emission credits to offset the difference between the emission standards and the FEL for such engine families will be in violation of the conditions of the certificate of conformity for such engine families. The certificates of conformity may be voided ab initio under § 89.126(c) for those engine families.</P>

              <P>(d) Failure by a manufacturer participating in the averaging, banking, or <PRTPAGE P="87"/>trading program to submit any end-of-year or final reports in the specified time for all engines is a violation of sections 203(a)(1) and 213 of the Clean Air Act for each engine.</P>
              <P>(e) A manufacturer generating credits for deposit only who fails to submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (90 days after the end of the model year) may not use the credits until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits pending EPA review is not permitted in these circumstances.</P>
              <P>(f) Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in the end-of-year report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected in the final report up to 270 days from the end of the model year.</P>
              <P>(g) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an end-of-year or final report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Erroneous negative credit balances may be adjusted by EPA.</P>
              <P>(h) If within 270 days of the end of the model year, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the manufacturer discovers such an error within 270 days of the end of the model year, the credits shall be restored for use by the manufacturer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Analyzer interference checks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Gases present in the exhaust other than the one being analyzed can interfere with the reading in several ways. Positive interference occurs in NDIR and PMD instruments when the interfering gas gives the same effect as the gas being measured, but to a lesser degree. Negative interference occurs in NDIR instruments by the interfering gas broadening the absorption band of the measured gas and in CLD instruments by the interfering gas quenching the radiation. The interference checks described in this section are to be made initially and after any major repairs that could affect analyzer performance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedure overview.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases, generated raw or dilute during engine operation, are sampled for specific component analysis through the analytical train. The test is applicable to engines equipped with catalytic or direct-flame afterburners, induction system modifications, or other systems, or to uncontrolled engines.</P>
              <P>(b) The test is designed to determine the brake-specific emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter. For more information on particulate matter sampling see § 89.112(c). The test cycles consist of various steady-state operating modes that include different combinations of engine speeds and loads. These procedures require the determination of the concentration of each pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow (raw analysis), and the power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and used to calculate the grams of each pollutant emitted per kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr).</P>
              <P>(c)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions, the complete engine shall be tested with all emission control devices installed and functioning.</P>
              <P>(2) On air-cooled engines, the fan shall be installed.</P>
              <P>(3) Additional accessories (for example, oil cooler, alternators, or air compressors) may be installed but such accessory loading will be considered parasitic in nature and observed power shall be used in the emission calculation.</P>
              <P>(d) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the application must be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. In cases of component malfunction or failure, maintenance to correct component failure or malfunction must be authorized in accordance with § 86.094-25 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The exhaust gas sampling system described in this section is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in the exhaust of petroleum-fueled nonroad compression-ignition engines. This system utilizes the CVS concept (described in 40 CFR part 1065, subparts A and B) of measuring mass emissions of HC, CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>. A continuously integrated system is required for HC and NO<E T="52">X</E> measurement and is allowed for all CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> measurements. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement of CO<E T="52">2</E>. General requirements are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) This sampling system requires the use of a PDP-CVS and a heat exchanger or a CFV-CVS with either a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation. Figure 2 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the PDP-CVS system. Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the CFV-CVS system.</P>
              <P>(2) The HC analytical system for petroleum-fueled compression-ignition engines requires a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) and heated sample system (191 ±11 °C).</P>
              <P>(i) The HFID sample must be taken directly from the diluted exhaust stream through a heated probe and integrated continuously over the test cycle. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, the HFID must be used with a constant flow system to ensure a representative sample.</P>
              <P>(ii) The heated probe shall be located in the primary dilution tunnel and far enough downstream of the mixing chamber to ensure a uniform sample distribution across the CVS duct at the point of sampling.</P>
              <P>(3) The CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> analytical system requires:</P>
              <P>(i) Bag sampling (see 40 CFR part 1065) and analytical capabilities (see 40 CFR part 1065), as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, a constant flow system must be used to ensure a representative sample.</P>
              <P>(4) The NO<E T="52">X</E> analytical system requires a continuously integrated measurement of diluted NO<E T="52">X</E> meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, a constant flow system must be used to ensure a representative sample.</P>

              <P>(5) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. Other components, such as snubbers, which are not needed to maintain <PRTPAGE P="117"/>accuracy on some systems, may be excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(6) Other sampling and/or analytical systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Component description.</E> The components necessary for exhaust sampling shall meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exhaust dilution system.</E> The PDP-CVS shall conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas PDP-CVS in 40 CFR part 1065. The CFV-CVS shall conform to all the requirements listed for the exhaust gas CFV-CVS in 40 CFR part 1065. In addition, the CVS must conform to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream at or below the temperature required for the measurement of hydrocarbon emissions noted in the following paragraph and to prevent condensation of water at any point in the dilution tunnel.</P>
              <P>(ii) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream in the primary dilution tunnel at a temperature of 191 °C or less at the sampling zone for hydrocarbon measurement and as required to prevent condensation at any point in the dilution tunnel. Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from this sampling point.</P>
              <P>(iii) For the CFV-CVS, either a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation is required (see Figure 3 in appendix A to this subpart).</P>
              <P>(iv) For the CFV-CVS when a heat exchanger is used, the gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately ahead of the critical flow venturi, shall be within ±11 °C) of the average operating temperature observed during the test with the simultaneous requirement that condensation does not occur. The temperature measuring system (sensors and readout) shall have an accuracy and precision of ±2 °C. For systems utilizing a flow compensator to maintain proportional flow, the requirement for maintaining constant temperature is not necessary.</P>
              <P>(v) The primary dilution air shall have a temperature of 25 °C ±5 °C.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Continuous HC measurement system.</E> (i) The continuous HC sample system (as shown in Figure 2 or 3 in appendix A to this subpart) uses an “overflow” zero and span system. In this type of system, excess zero or span gas spills out of the probe when zero and span checks of the analyzer are made. The “overflow” system may also be used to calibrate the HC analyzer according to 40 CFR part 1065, subpart F, although this is not required.</P>
              <P>(ii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC sample probe, line or system, unless a common sample pump is used for all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good engineering practice.</P>
              <P>(iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line shall be at least 105 percent of the sample system flow rate.</P>
              <P>(iv) The overflow gases shall enter the heated sample line as close as practical to the outside surface of the CVS duct or dilution tunnel.</P>
              <P>(v) The continuous HC sampling system shall consist of a probe (which must raise the sample to the specified temperature) and, where used, a sample transfer system (which must maintain the specified temperature). The continuous hydrocarbon sampling system (exclusive of the probe) shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Maintain a wall temperature of 191 °C ±11 °C as measured at every separately controlled heated component (that is, filters, heated line sections), using permanent thermocouples located at each of the separate components.</P>

              <P>(B) Have a wall temperature of 191 °C ±11 °C over its entire length. The temperature of the system shall be demonstrated by profiling the thermal characteristics of the system where possible at initial installation and after any major maintenance performed on the system. The profiling shall be accomplished using the insertion thermocouple probing technique. The system temperature will be monitored continuously during testing at the locations and temperature described in 40 CFR 1065.145.<PRTPAGE P="118"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) Maintain a gas temperature of 191 °C ±11 °C immediately before the heated filter and HFID. These gas temperatures will be determined by a temperature sensor located immediately upstream of each component.</P>
              <P>(vi) The continuous hydrocarbon sampling probe shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Be defined as the first 25 cm to 76 cm of the continuous hydrocarbon sampling system.</P>
              <P>(B) Have a 0.48 cm minimum inside diameter.</P>
              <P>(C) Be installed in the primary dilution tunnel at a point where the dilution air and exhaust are well mixed (that is, approximately 10 tunnel diameters downstream of the point where the exhaust enters the dilution tunnel).</P>
              <P>(D) Be sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the tunnel wall so as to be free from the influence of any wakes or eddies.</P>
              <P>(E) Increase the gas stream temperature to 191 °C ±11 °C at the exit of the probe. The ability of the probe to accomplish this shall be demonstrated using the insertion thermocouple technique at initial installation and after any major maintenance. Compliance with the temperature specification shall be demonstrated by continuously recording during each test the temperature of either the gas stream or the wall of the sample probe at its terminus.</P>
              <P>(vii) The response time of the continuous measurement system shall be no greater than:</P>
              <P>(A) 1.5 seconds from an instantaneous step change at the port entrance to the analyzer to within 90 percent of the step change.</P>
              <P>(B) 20 seconds from an instantaneous step change at the entrance to the sample probe or overflow span gas port to within 90 percent of the step change. Analysis system response time shall be coordinated with CVS flow fluctuations and sampling time/test cycle offsets if necessary.</P>
              <P>(C) For the purpose of verification of response times, the step change shall be at least 60 percent of full-scale chart deflection.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Primary dilution tunnel.</E> (i) The primary dilution tunnel shall be:</P>
              <P>(A) Small enough in diameter to cause turbulent flow (Reynolds Number greater than 4000) and of sufficient length to cause complete mixing of the exhaust and dilution air;</P>
              <P>(B) At least 46 cm in diameter; (engines below 110 kW may use a dilution tunnel that is 20 cm in diameter or larger)</P>
              <P>(C) Constructed of electrically conductive material which does not react with the exhaust components; and</P>
              <P>(D) Electrically grounded.</P>
              <P>(ii) The temperature of the diluted exhaust stream inside of the primary dilution tunnel shall be sufficient to prevent water condensation.</P>
              <P>(iii) The engine exhaust shall be directed downstream at the point where it is introduced into the primary dilution tunnel.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Continuously integrated NO</E>
                <E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>
                <E T="03">measurement systems.</E> (i) The sample probe shall:</P>
              <P>(A) Be in the same plane as the continuous HC probe, but shall be sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the tunnel wall so as to be free from the influences of any wakes or eddies.</P>
              <P>(B) Heated and insulated over the entire length, to prevent water condensation, to a minimum temperature of 55 °C. Sample gas temperature immediately before the first filter in the system shall be at least 55 °C.</P>
              <P>(ii) The continuous NO<E T="52">X</E>, CO, or CO<E T="52">2</E> sampling and analysis system shall conform to the specifications of 40 CFR 1065.145 with the following exceptions and revisions:</P>
              <P>(A) The system components required to be heated by 40 CFR 1065.145 need only be heated to prevent water condensation, the minimum component temperature shall be 55 °C.</P>
              <P>(B) The system response shall meet the specifications in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart C.</P>
              <P>(C) Alternative NO<E T="52">X</E> measurement techniques outlined in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart D, are not permitted for NO<E T="52">X</E> measurement in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(D) All analytical gases must conform to the specifications of § 89.312.</P>
              <P>(E) Any range on a linear analyzer below 155 ppm must have and use a calibration curve conforming to § 89.310.</P>

              <P>(iii) The chart deflections or voltage output of analyzers with non-linear <PRTPAGE P="119"/>calibration curves shall be converted to concentration values by the calibration curve(s) specified in § 89.313 before flow correction (if used) and subsequent integration takes place.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Background sample.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Background samples are produced by continuously drawing a sample of dilution air during the exhaust collection phase of each test cycle mode.</P>
              <P>(1) Individual background samples may be produced and analyzed for each mode. Hence, a unique background value will be used for the emission calculations for each mode.</P>
              <P>(2) Alternatively, a single background sample may be produced by drawing a sample during the collection phase of each of the test cycle modes. Hence, a single cumulative background value will be used for the emission calculations for each mode.</P>
              <P>(b) For analysis of the individual sample described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized period is stored. All readings taken during the 10-second interval must be stable at the final value to within ±1 percent of full scale.</P>
              <P>(c) Measure HC, CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> exhaust and background concentrations in the sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow rates and pressures used during calibration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exhaust gas analytical system; CVS bag sample.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Schematic drawings.</E> Figure 4 in appendix A to this subpart is a schematic drawing of the exhaust gas analytical system used for analyzing CVS bag samples from compression- ignition engines. Since various configurations can produce accurate results, exact conformance with the drawing is not required. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and switches may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. Other components such as snubbers, which are not needed to maintain accuracy in some systems, may be excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Major component description.</E> The analytical system, Figure 4 in appendix A to this subpart, consists of a flame ionization detector (FID) (heated for petroleum-fueled compression-ignition engines to 191 °C ±6 °C) for the measurement of hydrocarbons, nondispersive infrared analyzers (NDIR) for the measurement of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and a chemiluminescence detector (CLD) (or HCLD) for the measurement of oxides of nitrogen. The exhaust gas analytical system shall conform to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The CLD (or HCLD) requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in the sample be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of analyzers may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) If CO instruments are used which are essentially free of CO<E T="52">2</E> and water vapor interference, the use of the conditioning column may be deleted. (See 40 CFR part 1065, subpart D.)</P>

              <P>(3) A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of CO<E T="52">2</E> and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture of 3 percent CO<E T="52">2</E> in N2, which has been bubbled through water at room temperature, produces an equivalent CO response, as measured on the most sensitive CO range, which is less than 1 percent of full scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or less than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale.

              <SUBJECT>Dilute sampling procedures—CVS calibration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor valve.</P>
              <P>(1) The flowmeter calibration must be traceable to NIST measurements, and will serve as the reference value (NIST “true” value) for the CVS calibration. (Note: In no case should an upstream screen or other restriction which can affect the flow be used ahead of the flowmeter unless calibrated throughout the flow range with such a device.)</P>
              <P>(2) The CVS calibration procedures are designed for use of a “metering venturi” type flowmeter. Large radius or ASME flow nozzles are considered equivalent if traceable to NIST measurements. Other measurement systems may be used if shown to be equivalent under the test conditions in this section and traceable to NIST measurements.</P>
              <P>(3) Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are recorded and related to flow through the CVS.</P>
              <P>(4) Procedures used by EPA for both PDP-CVS and CFV-CVS are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of the entire system may be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of the system (for example, analyzer calibration, leaks, or HC hangup). A verification procedure is found in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PDP-CVS calibration.</E> (1) The following calibration procedure outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the PDP-CVS pump.</P>
              <P>(i) All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump.</P>
              <P>(ii) The calculated flow rate, in</P>
              <FP>(cm<SU>3</SU>/s), (at pump inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of pump parameters.</FP>
              <P>(iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is then determined.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range used must be performed.</P>
              <P>(2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Two conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve:</P>
              <P>(i) The temperature stability must be maintained during calibration. (Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations; this can cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes in temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes.)</P>
              <P>(ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of leakage.</P>
              <P>(3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the calibration equation.</P>
              <P>(4) Connect a system as shown in Figure 5 in appendix A to this subpart. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the system indicated, the following measurements and accuracies are required:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test orders.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A test order addressed to the manufacturer is required for any testing under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) The test order is signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or his or her designee. The test order must be delivered in person by an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative to a company representative or sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the manufacturer's representative who signed the application for certification submitted by the manufacturer, pursuant to the requirements of the applicable section of subpart B of this part. Upon receipt of a test order, the manufacturer must comply with all of the provisions of this subpart and instructions in the test order.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Information included in test order.</E> (1) The test order will specify the engine family to be selected for testing, the manufacturer's engine assembly plant or associated storage facility or port facility (for imported engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time and location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure by which engines of the specified family must be selected. The test order may specify the configuration to be audited and/or the number of engines to be selected per day. Engine manufacturers are required to select a minimum of four engines per day unless an alternate selection procedure is approved pursuant to § 89.507(a), or unless total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day, the manufacturer selects the actual number of engines produced per day.</P>
              <P>(2) The test order may include alternate families to be selected for testing at the Administrator's discretion in the event that engines of the specified family are not available for testing because those engines are not being manufactured during the specified time or are not being stored at the specified assembly plant, associated storage facilities, or port of entry.</P>
              <P>(3) If the specified family is not being manufactured at a rate of at least two engines per day in the case of manufacturers specified in § 89.508(g)(1), or one engine per day in the case of manufacturers specified in § 89.508(g)(2), over the expected duration of the audit, the Assistant Administrator or her or his designated representative may select engines of the alternate family for testing.</P>
              <P>(4) In addition, the test order may include other directions or information essential to the administration of the required testing.</P>
              <P>(d) A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families and the corresponding assembly plants, associated storage facilities, or (in the case of imported engines) port facilities from which the manufacturer prefers to have engines selected for testing in response to a test order. In order that a manufacturer's preferred location be considered for inclusion in a test order for a particular engine family, the list must be submitted prior to issuance of the test order. Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the list, the Administrator may order selection at other than a preferred location.</P>
              <P>(e) Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer must proceed in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) During a given model year, the Administrator may not issue to a manufacturer more Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) test orders than an annual limit determined to be the larger of the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Production factor, determined by dividing the projected nonroad engine sales in the United States for that model year, as declared by the manufacturer under § 89.505(c)(1), by 16,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number. If the projected sales are less than 8,000, this factor is one.</P>
              <P>(ii) Family factor, determined by dividing the manufacturer's total number of certified engine families by five and rounding to the nearest whole number.</P>

              <P>(2) If a manufacturer submits to EPA in writing prior to or during the model year a reliable sales projection update or adds engine families or deletes engine families from its production, that information is used for recalculating <PRTPAGE P="137"/>the manufacturer's annual limit of SEA test orders.</P>
              <P>(3) Any SEA test order for which the family fails under § 89.510 or for which testing is not completed is not counted against the annual limit.</P>
              <P>(4) When the annual limit has been met, the Administrator may issue additional test orders to test those families for which evidence exists indicating noncompliance. An SEA test order issued on this basis will include a statement as to the reason for its issuance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Testing by the Administrator.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Administrator may require by test order under § 89.503 that engines of a specified family be selected in a manner consistent with the requirements of § 89.507 and submitted to the Administrator at the place designated for the purpose of conducting emission tests. These tests will be conducted in accordance with § 89.508 to determine whether engines manufactured by the manufacturer conform with the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designating official data.</E> (1) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test engine or the Administrator and manufacturer each conduct a test on the same test engine, the results of the Administrator's test comprise the official data for that engine.</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever the manufacturer conducts all tests on a test engine, the manufacturer's test data is accepted as the official data, provided that if the Administrator makes a determination based on testing conducted under paragraph (a) of this section that there is a substantial lack of agreement between the manufacturer's test results and the Administrator's test results, no manufacturer's test data from the manufacturer's test facility will be accepted for purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) If testing conducted under § 89.503 is unacceptable under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Administrator must:</P>
              <P>(1) Notify the manufacturer in writing of the Administrator's determination that the test facility is inappropriate for conducting the tests required by this subpart and the reasons therefor; and</P>
              <P>(2) Reinstate any manufacturer's data upon a showing by the manufacturer that the data acquired under § 89.503 was erroneous and the manufacturer's data was correct.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer may request in writing that the Administrator reconsider the determination in paragraph (b)(2) of this section based on data or information which indicates that changes have been made to the test facility and these changes have resolved the reasons for disqualification.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sample selection.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at the location and in the manner specified in the test order. If a manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be selected in the manner specified in the test order, an <PRTPAGE P="140"/>alternative selection procedure may be employed, provided the manufacturer requests approval of the alternative procedure prior to the start of test sample selection, and the Administrator approves the procedure.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer must assemble the test engines of the family selected for testing using its normal mass production process for engines to be distributed into commerce. If, between the time the manufacturer is notified of a test order and the time the manufacturer finishes selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any change(s) in its production processes, including quality control, which may reasonably be expected to affect the emissions of the engines selected, then the manufacturer must, during the audit, inform the Administrator of such changes. If the test engines are selected at a location where they do not have their operational and emission control systems installed, the test order will specify the manner and location for selection of components to complete assembly of the engines. The manufacturer must assemble these components onto the test engines using normal assembly and quality control procedures as documented by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used on the test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the production and assembly of all other engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the modification in assembly procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement officer(s) or authorized representative(s), rather than the manufacturer, select the test engines according to the method specified in the test order.</P>
              <P>(e) The order in which test engines are selected determines the order in which test results are to be used in applying the sampling plan in accordance with § 89.510.</P>
              <P>(f) The manufacturer must keep on hand all untested engines, if any, comprising the test sample until a pass or fail decision is reached in accordance with § 89.510(e). The manufacturer may ship any tested engine which has not failed the requirements as set forth in § 89.510(b). However, once the manufacturer ships any test engine, it relinquishes the prerogative to conduct retests as provided in § 89.508(i).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) For nonroad engines subject to the provisions of this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are the nonroad engine 8-mode test procedure as described in subpart E of this part, the federal smoke test as described in part 86, subpart I of this chapter, and the particulate test procedure as adopted in the California Regulations for New 1996 and Later Heavy-Duty Off-Road Diesel Cycle Engines. This procedure is incorporated by reference. See § 89.6.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other than those specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any nonroad engine he or she determines is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify the engines selected for testing and may not perform any emission tests on engines selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are documented in the manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing in accordance with § 89.108, to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with § 89.108, prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the <PRTPAGE P="141"/>Administrator may not adjust it to any setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use engines.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Service Accumulation.</E> Prior to performing exhaust emission testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service equal to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission data engine corresponding to the family specified in the test order.</P>
              <P>(1) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of normal production engines. This service accumulation must be consistent with the new engine break-in instructions contained in the applicable owner's manual.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer must accumulate service at a minimum rate of 16 hours per engine during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(i) The first 24-hour period for service begins as soon as authorized checks, inspections, and preparations are completed on each engine.</P>
              <P>(ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate does not apply on weekends or holidays.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the manufacturer's service or target is less than the minimum rate specified (16 hours per day), then the minimum daily accumulation rate is equal to the manufacturer's service target.</P>
              <P>(3) Service accumulation must be completed on a sufficient number of test engines during consecutive 24-hour periods to assure that the number of engines tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on test engines after selection for testing, nor may the Administrator allow deletion of any engine from the test sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator before any engine maintenance or deletion.</P>
              <P>(e) The manufacturer must expeditiously ship test engines from the point of selection to the test facility. If the test facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point of selection, the manufacturer must assure that test engines arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection. The Administrator may approve more time for shipment based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</P>
              <P>(f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence.</P>
              <P>(g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer must notify the Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order as to which test facility will be used to comply with the test order. If no test cells are available at a desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(1) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the United States market for the applicable year of 7,500 or greater must complete emission testing at a minimum rate of two engines per 24-hour period, including each voided test and each smoke test.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and failing criteria for selective enforcement audits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.</P>
              <P>(b) A failed engine is one whose final test results pursuant to § 89.509(b), for one or more of the applicable pollutants, exceed the applicable emission standard or family emission level.</P>
              <P>(c) The manufacturer must test engines comprising the test sample until a pass decision is reached for all pollutants or a fail decision is reached for one pollutant. A pass decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for each pollutant is less than or equal to the pass decision number, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the cumulative number of engines tested. A fail decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed engines for one or more pollutants is greater than or equal to the fail decision number, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the cumulative number of engines tested.</P>
              <P>(d) The pass and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of engines tested are determined by using the tables in appendix A to this subpart, “Sampling Plans for Selective Enforcement Auditing of Nonroad Engines,” appropriate to the projected sales as made by the manufacturer in its report to EPA under § 89.505(c)(1). In the tables in appendix A to this subpart, sampling plan “stage” refers to the cumulative number of engines tested. Once a pass or fail decision has been made for a particular pollutant, the number of engines with final test results exceeding the emission standard for that pollutant shall not be considered any further for the purposes of the audit.</P>
              <P>(e) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision is made on the last engine required to make a decision under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any engine failing pursuant to paragraph (b) of § 89.510 effective from the time that testing of that engine is completed.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for a family which does not pass an SEA, pursuant to paragraph § 89.510(c), based on the first test or all tests conducted on each engine. This suspension will not occur before ten days after failure of the audit, unless the manufacturer requests an earlier suspension.</P>
              <P>(c) If the results of testing pursuant to these regulations indicate that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.</P>

              <P>(d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the application may be covered by a certificate of conformity, the Administrator may suspend such certificate immediately in whole or in part if the Administrator finds any one of the following infractions to be substantial:<PRTPAGE P="144"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test order issued by the Administrator under § 89.503.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized representative(s) is denied the opportunity to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this subpart and a warrant or court order is presented to the manufacturer or the party in charge of a facility in question.</P>
              <P>(6) An EPA enforcement officer(s) or EPA authorized representative(s) is unable to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in § 89.506 because a manufacturer has located a facility in a foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits those activities.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator must notify the manufacturer in writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in part; a suspension or revocation is effective upon receipt of the notification or ten days, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for a family when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as reported by the manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as described in the application for certification of the affected family.</P>
              <P>(g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine:</P>
              <P>(1) Remedy the nonconformity.</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine conforms to applicable standards or family emission levels by retesting the engine in accordance with these regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other information that may be required by this part.</P>
              <P>(h) Once a certificate for a failed family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate:</P>
              <P>(1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies will be implemented.</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family, at the plant(s), port facility(ies) or associated storage facility(ies) specified by the Administrator, in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for an engine actually determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards or family emission levels through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) Once the certificate for a family has been revoked under paragraph (f) of this section and the manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before the Administrator may consider issuing a certificate for that modified family:<PRTPAGE P="145"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (g) of this section, whether subsequent testing under this subpart is sufficient to evaluate the proposed change or changes or whether additional testing is required; and</P>
              <P>(2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the modified engine family does in fact conform with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that modified engine family in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order. If the subsequent audit results in passing of the audit, the Administrator will reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family, provided that the manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this subpart are limited to the family affected by the test order.</P>
              <P>(j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than 15 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.</P>
              <P>(k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph (d) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) will be in writing and will include the offer of an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with §§ 89.512, 89.513, and 89.514 and</P>
              <P>(2) need not apply to engines no longer in the hands of the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section and prior to the commencement of a hearing under § 89.512, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the Administrator will reinstate the certificate.</P>
              <P>(m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines when conducting an audit of a family subsequent to a failure of an SEA and while reauditing of the failed family, it may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition that the manufacturer consents to recall all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the family fails the subsequent audit at the level of the standard and to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request for public hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision under § 89.511 (b), (c), (d), or (f) to suspend or revoke a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to § 89.511 (a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing.</P>

              <P>(b) The manufacturer's request must be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of the decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer must simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Director of the Engine Programs and Compliance Division and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, at her or his discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a <PRTPAGE P="146"/>hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.</P>
              <P>(c) The manufacturer's request for a public hearing must include:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement as to which engine configuration(s) within a family is to be the subject of the hearing;</P>
              <P>(2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing requested under § 89.511(j), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether tests have been properly conducted, specifically, whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning;</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether sampling plans have been properly applied, specifically, whether sampling procedures specified in appendix A of this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines produced at plants other than the one from which engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's decision under § 89.511(c);</P>
              <P>(3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and</P>
              <P>(4) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's position on each of the issues raised.</P>
              <P>(d) A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available to the public during Agency business hours.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Except where otherwise indicated, this subpart is applicable to nonroad engines for which the Administrator has promulgated regulations under this part prescribing emission standards <PRTPAGE P="150"/>and nonroad vehicles and equipment containing such nonroad engines that are offered for importation or imported into the United States, but which engines, at the time of conditional importation, are not covered by certificates of conformity issued under section 213 and section 206(a) of the Clean Air Act as amended (that is, which are nonconforming nonroad engines as defined in § 89.602), and this part. Compliance with regulations under this subpart does not relieve any person or entity from compliance with other applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Regulations prescribing further procedures for the importation of nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles and equipment into the customs territory of the United States, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1202, are set forth in U.S. Bureau of Customs regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purposes of this subpart, the term “nonroad engine” includes all nonroad engines incorporated into nonroad equipment or nonroad vehicles at the time they are imported or offered for import into the United States.</P>

              <P>(d) Importers must complete the appropriate EPA declaration form before importing an engine. These forms are available on the Internet at <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/OTAQ/imports/</E> or by phone at 734-214-4100. Importers must keep the forms for five years and make them available upon request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General requirements for importation of nonconforming nonroad engines.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A nonconforming nonroad engine offered for importation into the United States is to be imported only by an Independent Commercial Importer (ICI) who is a holder of a currently valid certificate of conformity unless an exemption or exclusion is granted by the Administrator under § 89.611 of this subpart. For a nonroad engine imported pursuant to § 89.605, the ICI must hold a currently valid certificate of conformity for that specific nonroad engine model.</P>
              <P>(b) Any nonroad engine imported into the United States must have a legible unique engine identification number permanently affixed to or engraved on the engine.</P>
              <P>(c) Final admission may not be granted unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The nonroad engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued under subpart B of this part in the name of the ICI and the ICI has complied with all requirements of § 89.605; or</P>
              <P>(2) The nonroad engine is modified and emission tested in accordance with the provisions of § 89.609 and the ICI has complied with all other requirements of § 89.609; or</P>
              <P>(3) The nonroad engine is exempted or excluded under § 89.611.</P>
              <P>(d) The ICI must submit to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of EPA a copy of all approved applications for certification used to obtain certificates of conformity for the purpose of importing nonconforming nonroad engines pursuant to § 89.605 or § 89.609. In addition, the ICI must submit to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division a copy of all approved production changes implemented pursuant to § 89.605 or subpart B of this part. Documentation submitted pursuant to this paragraph (d) must be provided to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division within 10 working days of approval of the certification application (or production change) by EPA.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) The applicable emission standards for engines imported by an ICI under this subpart are the emission standards applicable to the Original Production (OP) year of the engine.</P>
              <P>(2) Where engine manufacturers have choices in emission standards for one or more pollutants in a given model year, the standard that applies to the ICI is the least stringent standard for that pollutant applicable to the OP year for the appropriate power category.</P>
              <P>(3) ICIs may not generate, use or trade emission credits or otherwise participate in any way in the averaging, banking and trading program.</P>
              <P>(4) An ICI may import no more than a total of five engines under this part for any given model year, except as allowed by paragraph (e)(5) of this section. For ICIs owned by a parent company, the importation limit includes importation by the parent company and all its subsidiaries.</P>

              <P>(5) An ICI may exceed the limit outlined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, provided that any engines in excess of the limit meet the emission standards and other requirements outlined in the applicable provisions of Part 89 or 1039 of this chapter for the model year in which the engine is modified (instead <PRTPAGE P="152"/>of the emission standards and other requirements applicable for the OP year of the vehicle/engine).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Conditional admission.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A nonroad engine offered for importation under § 89.605 or § 89.609 may be conditionally admitted into the United States. These engines are refused final admission, unless at the time of conditional admission the importer has submitted to the Administrator a written report that the subject nonroad engine has been permitted conditional admission pending EPA approval of its application for final admission under § 89.605 or § 89.609. This written report is to contain the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Identification of the importer of the nonroad engine and the importer's address, telephone number, and taxpayer identification number;</P>
              <P>(2) Identification of the nonroad engine owner, the owner's address, telephone number, and taxpayer identification number;</P>
              <P>(3) Identification of the nonroad engine including make, model, identification number, and original production year;</P>
              <P>(4) Information indicating under what provision of these regulations the nonroad engine is to be imported;</P>
              <P>(5) Identification of the place where the subject nonroad engine is to be stored until EPA approval of the importer's application to the Administrator for final admission;</P>
              <P>(6) Authorization for EPA enforcement officers to conduct inspections or testing otherwise permitted by the Act or regulations thereunder;</P>
              <P>(7) Identification of the Independent Commercial Importer's (ICI) certificate of conformity that permits the ICI to import that nonroad engine (for importation under § 89.605 or § 89.609); and</P>
              <P>(8) Such other information as is deemed necessary by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) EPA will not require a U.S. Customs Service bond for a nonconforming nonroad engine which is imported under § 89.605 or § 89.609. The period of conditional admission may not exceed 120 days. Nonroad engines imported under § 89.605 or § 89.609 may not be operated during the period of conditional admission except for that operation necessary to comply with the requirements of this subpart. During the period of conditional admission applicable to § 89.605 or § 89.609, the importer must store the nonroad engine at a location where the Administrator has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for inspection.</P>
              <P>(c) During the period of conditional admission under § 89.605 or § 89.609, an ICI may transfer responsibility of a nonroad engine to another qualified ICI for the purposes of complying with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The transferee ICI must be a holder of a currently valid certificate of conformity for the specific nonroad engine being transferred or be authorized to import the nonroad engine pursuant to § 89.609 as of the transfer date. The transferee ICI must comply with all the requirements of § 89.603, § 89.604, and either § 89.605 or § 89.609, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purpose of this subpart, the transferee ICI has “imported” the nonroad engine as of the transfer date as designated in a written record that is signed by both ICIs.</P>
              <P>(3) The ICI that originally imported the nonroad engine is responsible for all requirements of this subpart from the actual date of importation until the date of transfer as designated in the written record. The transferee ICI is responsible for all requirements of this subpart beginning on the date of transfer.</P>
              <P>(4) A copy of the written record is to be submitted to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of EPA within five working days of the transfer date.</P>

              <P>(d) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart or U.S. Customs Service regulations, an ICI may also assume responsibility for the modification and testing of a nonconforming nonroad engine which was previously imported by another party. The ICI must be a holder of a currently valid certificate of conformity for that specific nonroad engine or authorized to import it pursuant to § 89.609 at the time of assuming such responsibility. <PRTPAGE P="153"/>The ICI must comply with all the requirements of § 89.603, § 89.604, and either § 89.605 or § 89.609, as applicable. For the purposes of this subpart, the ICI has “imported” the nonroad engine as of the date the ICI assumes responsibility for the modification and testing of the nonroad engine. The ICI must submit written notification to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of EPA within 10 working days of the assumption of that responsibility.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Final admission of certified nonroad engines.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A nonroad engine may be finally admitted into the United States upon approval of the ICI's application to the Administrator. The application is made by completing EPA forms in accordance with EPA instructions. The application contains:</P>
              <P>(1) The information required in § 89.604(a);</P>
              <P>(2) Information demonstrating that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with a valid certificate of conformity. Demonstration is made in one of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(i) The ICI attests that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with the provisions of the ICI's certificate of conformity; presents to EPA a statement written by the applicable Original Engine Manufacturer that the Original Engine Manufacturer must provide to the ICI, and to EPA, information concerning production changes to the class of nonroad engines described in the ICI's application for certification; delivers to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of EPA notification by the ICI of any production changes already implemented by the Original Engine Manufacturer at the time of application and their effect on emissions; and obtains from EPA written approval to use this demonstration option; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The ICI attests that the nonroad engine has been modified in accordance with the provisions of the ICI's certificate of conformity. The ICI also attests that it has conducted, within 120 days of entry, an applicable and valid emission test on every third nonroad engine imported under that certificate of conformity to demonstrate compliance with Federal emission requirements. The test is to be conducted at a laboratory located within the United States. Sequencing of the tests is determined by the date of importation of each nonroad engine beginning with the prototype nonroad engine used to obtain the applicable certificate of conformity. Should the ICI exceed a threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity without adjustments or other changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the amount of required testing is reduced to every fifth nonroad engine.</P>
              <P>(3) The results of every emission test which the ICI conducted on the nonroad engine pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Should a subject nonroad engine fail an emission test at any time, the following procedures are applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) The ICI may either:</P>
              <P>(A) Conduct one retest that involves no adjustment of the nonroad engine from the previous test (for example, adjusting the RPM, timing, air-to-fuel ratio, and so forth) other than adjustments to adjustable parameters that, upon inspection, were found to be out of tolerance. When such an allowable adjustment is made, the parameter may be reset only to the specified (that is, nominal) value (and not any other value within the tolerance band); or</P>
              <P>(B) Initiate a change in production (production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal emission requirements.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the ICI chooses to retest in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section:</P>
              <P>(A) The retests are to be completed no later than five working days subsequent to the first emission test;</P>
              <P>(B) Should the subject nonroad engine fail the second emission test, then the ICI must initiate a change in production (a production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad engine to meet federal emission requirements.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the ICI chooses to initiate a change in production (a production change) under the provisions of subpart B of this part that causes the nonroad <PRTPAGE P="154"/>engine to meet federal requirements, a change involving adjustments of adjustable nonroad engine parameters (for example, adjusting the RPM, timing, air/fuel ratio) represents a change in the specified (that is, nominal) value to be deemed acceptable by EPA.</P>
              <P>(iv) A production change made in accordance with this section is to be implemented on all subsequent nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity after the date of importation of the nonroad engine which gave rise to the production change.</P>
              <P>(v) Commencing with the first nonroad engine receiving the production change, every third nonroad engine imported under the certificate of conformity is to be emission tested to demonstrate compliance with federal emission requirements until, as in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a threshold of 300 nonroad engines imported under the certificate of conformity is exceeded without adjustments or other changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, at which time the amount of required emission testing is reduced to every fifth nonroad engine.</P>
              <P>(vi) A report concerning these production changes is to be made to the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of EPA within ten working days of initiation of the production change. The cause of any failure of an emission test is to be identified, if known;</P>
              <P>(4) The applicable deterioration factor, if any;</P>
              <P>(5) The emission test results adjusted by the deterioration factor;</P>
              <P>(6) Other information that may be specified by applicable regulations or on the certificate of conformity under which the nonroad engine has been modified in order to assure compliance with requirements of the Act;</P>
              <P>(7) All information required under § 89.610 related to maintenance, warranties, and labeling;</P>
              <P>(8) An attestation by the ICI that the ICI is responsible for the nonroad engine's compliance with federal emission requirements, regardless of whether the ICI owns the nonroad engine imported under this section;</P>
              <P>(9) The name, address, and telephone number of the person who the ICI prefers to receive EPA notification under § 89.605(c);</P>
              <P>(10) An attestation by the ICI that all requirements of § 89.607 and § 89.610 have been met; and</P>
              <P>(11) Other information as is deemed necessary by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is to be presumed not to have been granted if a requirement of this subpart has not been met. This includes, but is not limited to, properly modifying the nonroad engine to be in conformity in all material respects with the description in the application for certification or not complying with the provisions of § 89.605(a)(2) or if the final emission test results, adjusted by the deterioration factor, if applicable, do not comply with applicable emission standards.</P>
              <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, EPA approval for final admission of a nonroad engine under this section is presumed to have been granted if the ICI does not receive oral or written notice from EPA to the contrary within 15 working days of the date that the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of EPA receives the ICI's application under paragraph (a) of this section. EPA notice of nonapproval may be made to any employee of the ICI. It is the responsibility of the ICI to ensure that the Engine Programs and Compliance Division of EPA receives the application and to confirm the date of receipt. During this 15 working day hold period, the nonroad engine is to be stored at a location where the Administrator has reasonable access to the nonroad engine for the Administrator's inspection. The storage is to be within 50 miles of the ICI's testing facility to allow the Administrator reasonable access for inspection and testing. A storage facility not meeting this criterion must be approved in writing by the Administrator prior to the submittal of the ICI's application under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

A copy of the warranties and evidence that the warranties are paid and in effect is to be maintained in a file containing the records for each nonroad engine prior to submitting each application for final admission pursuant to § 89.605(a) or § 89.609(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Emission labeling.</E> (1) For each nonroad engine imported pursuant to § 89.605 or § 89.609, the ICI must affix a permanent legible label which identifies each nonroad engine and also satisfies the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The label meets all the requirements of § 89.110 and contains the following statement “This nonroad engine was originally produced in (month and year of original production). It has been imported and modified by (ICI's name, address, and telephone number) to conform to United States emission regulations applicable to the (year) model year.”</P>
              <P>(ii) If the nonroad engine is owned by the ICI at the time of importation, the label also states “This nonroad engine is warranted for five years or 3000 hours of operation from the date of purchase, whichever first occurs.”</P>
              <P>(iii) If the nonroad engine is not owned by the ICI at the time of importation, the label states “This nonroad engine is warranted for five years or 3000 hours of operation from the date of release to the owner, whichever first occurs.”</P>
              <P>(iv) For nonroad engines imported under § 89.609, the label clearly states in bold letters that “This nonroad engine has not been manufactured under a certificate of conformity but conforms to United States emission regulations under a modification/test program.” For all nonroad engines imported pursuant to § 89.605 or § 89.609, the label contains the vacuum hose routing diagram applicable to the nonroad engines.</P>
              <P>(2) As part of the application to the Administrator for final admission of each individual nonroad engine under § 89.609, the ICI must maintain a copy of the labels for each nonroad engine in a file containing the records for that nonroad engine prior to submitting each application for final admission. ICIs importing under § 89.605 or § 89.609 must attest to compliance with the preceding labeling requirements of this section in each application for final admission.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 89.611</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Exemptions and exclusions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Individuals, as well as ICIs, are eligible for importing nonroad engines into the United States under the provisions of this section, unless otherwise specified.</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, a nonroad engine entitled to one of the temporary exemptions of this paragraph may be conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written approval for the conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission is to be under bond. The Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request for approval from the Administrator is to contain the identification required in § 89.604(a) (except for § 89.604(a)(5)) and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption. Noncompliance with provisions of this section may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond or exportation of the nonroad engine. The following temporary exemptions are permitted by this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exemption for repairs or alterations.</E> A person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming engine solely for purpose of repairs or alterations. The engine may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of repair or alteration or shipment to the point of repair or alteration and to the port of export. It <PRTPAGE P="160"/>may not be sold or leased in the United States and is to be exported upon completion of the repairs or alterations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Testing exemption.</E> A test nonroad engine may be conditionally imported by a person subject to the requirements of § 89.905. A test nonroad engine may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a request is made by the appropriate importer concerning the nonroad engine in accordance with § 89.905(f) for a subsequent one-year period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Precertification exemption.</E> A prototype nonroad engine for use in applying to EPA for certification pursuant to this subpart may be conditionally imported subject to applicable provisions of § 89.906 and the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) No more than one prototype nonroad engine for each engine family for which an importer is seeking certification is to be imported.</P>
              <P>(ii) The granting of precertification exemptions by the Administrator is discretionary. Normally, no more than three outstanding precertification exemptions are allowed for each importer. No precertification exemption is allowed if the importer requesting the exemption is in noncompliance with any requirement of this subpart until the noncompliance is corrected.</P>
              <P>(iii) Unless a certificate of conformity is issued for the prototype nonroad engine and the nonroad engine is finally admitted pursuant to the requirements of § 89.605 within 180 days from the date of entry, the total amount of the bond is to be forfeited or the nonroad engine exported unless an extension is granted by the Administrator. A request for an extension is to be in writing and received by the Administrator prior to the date that the precertification exemption expires.</P>
              <P>(iv) Such precertification nonroad engine may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of the precertification exemption.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Display exemptions.</E> (i) A nonroad engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported subject to the requirements of § 89.907.</P>
              <P>(ii) A display nonroad engine may be imported by any person for purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, display of a nonroad engine at a dealership, private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for display exemptions. A display nonroad engine may not be sold in the United States and may not be operated in the United States except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</P>
              <P>(iii) A temporary display exemption is granted for 12 months or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Two extensions of up to 12 months each are available upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption exceed 36 months. The U.S. Customs Service bonds a temporary display exemption.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, a nonroad engine may be finally admitted into the United States under this paragraph if prior written approval for such final admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission of these nonroad engines under this subpart is not permitted for the purpose of obtaining such written approval from the Administrator. A request for approval is to contain the identification information required in § 89.604(a) (except for § 89.604(a)(5)) and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption or exclusion. The following exemptions or exclusions are permitted by this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">National security exemption.</E> A nonroad engine may be imported under the national security exemption found at § 89.908.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Hardship exemption.</E> The Administrator may exempt on a case-by-case basis a nonroad engine from federal emission requirements to accommodate unforeseen cases of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Exemption for nonroad engines identical to United States certified versions.</E> (i) <PRTPAGE P="161"/>A person (including businesses) is eligible for importing a nonroad engine into the United States under the provisions of this paragraph. An exemption will be granted if the nonroad engine:</P>
              <P>(A) is owned by the importer;</P>
              <P>(B) is not offered for importation for the purpose of resale; and</P>
              <P>(C) is proven to be identical, in all material respects, to a nonroad engine certified by the Original Engine Manufacturer (OEM) for sale in the United States or is proven to have been modified to be identical, in all material respects, to a nonroad engine certified by the OEM for sale in the United States according to complete written instructions provided by the OEM's United States representative, or his/her designee.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Proof of conformity.</E> (A) Documentation submitted pursuant to this section for the purpose of proving conformity of individual nonroad engines is to contain sufficiently organized data or evidence demonstrating that the nonroad engine identified pursuant to § 89.604(a) is identical, in all material respects, to a nonroad engine identified in an OEM's application for certification.</P>
              <P>(B) If the documentation does not contain all the information required by this part, or is not sufficiently organized, EPA notifies the importer of any areas of inadequacy, and that the documentation does not receive further consideration until the required information or organization is provided.</P>
              <P>(C) If EPA determines that the documentation does not clearly or sufficiently demonstrate that a nonroad engine is eligible for importation, EPA notifies the importer in writing.</P>
              <P>(D) If EPA determines that the documentation clearly and sufficiently demonstrates that a nonroad engine is eligible for importation, EPA grants approval for importation and notifies the importer in writing. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, the notice constitutes approval for final admission into the United States.</P>
              <P>(d) Foreign diplomatic and military personnel may import a nonconforming nonroad engine without bond. At the time of admission, the importer must submit to the Administrator the written report required in § 89.604(a) (except for information required by § 89.604(a)(5)) and a statement from the U.S. Department of State confirming qualification for this exemption. The nonroad engine may not be sold in the United States and must be exported if the individual's diplomatic status is no longer applicable, as determined by the Department of State, unless subsequently brought into conformity in accordance with §§ 89.605, 89.609, or 89.611(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Competition exclusion.</E> A nonconforming engine may be imported by any person provided the importer demonstrates to the Administrator that the engine is used to propel a vehicle used solely for competition and obtains prior written approval from the Administrator. A nonconforming engine imported pursuant to this paragraph may not be operated in the United States except for that operation incident and necessary for the competition purpose, unless subsequently brought into conformity with United States emission requirements in accordance with §§ 89.605, 89.609, or 89.611(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exclusions/exemptions based on date of original manufacture.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subpart, the following nonroad engines are excluded, as determined by the engine's gross power output, from the requirements of the Act in accordance with section 213 of the Act and may be imported by any person:</P>
              <P>(i) All nonroad engines greater than or equal to 37 kW but less than 75 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 1998.</P>
              <P>(ii) All nonroad engines greater than or equal to 75 kW but less than 130 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 1997.</P>
              <P>(iii) All nonroad engines greater than or equal to 130 kW but less than or equal to 560 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 1996.</P>
              <P>(iv) All nonroad engines greater than 560 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 2000.</P>

              <P>(v) All nonroad engines greater than or equal to 19 kW but less than 37 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 1999.<PRTPAGE P="162"/>
              </P>
              <P>(vi) All nonroad engines less than 19 kW originally manufactured prior to January 1, 2000.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, a nonroad engine not subject to an exclusion under § 89.611(f)(1) but greater than 20 original production (OP) years old is entitled to an exemption from the requirements of the Act, provided that it has not been modified in those 20 OP years and it is imported into the United States by an ICI. At the time of admission, the ICI must submit to the Administrator the written report required in § 89.604(a) (except for information required by § 89.604(a)(5)).</P>
              <P>(g) An application for exemption and exclusion provided for in paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section is to be mailed to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources, Engine Programs and Compliance Division (6405-J), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Imports.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prohibited acts; penalties.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The importation of a nonroad engine, including a nonroad engine incorporated into a nonroad vehicle or nonroad equipment, which is not covered by a certificate of conformity other than in accordance with this subpart and the entry regulations of the U.S. Customs Service is prohibited. Failure to comply with this section is a violation of section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise permitted by this subpart, during a period of conditional admission, the importer of a nonroad engine may not:</P>
              <P>(1) Register, license, or operate the nonroad engine in the United States;</P>
              <P>(2) Sell or offer the nonroad engine for sale;</P>
              <P>(3) Store the nonroad engine on the premises of a dealer (unless approved by the Administrator), owner, or purchaser;</P>
              <P>(4) Relinquish control of the nonroad engine to the owner or purchaser; or</P>
              <P>(5) Cause a nonroad engine to be altered in any manner subsequent to modification and testing, if applicable, for which an application for final admission is based and submitted to the Administrator, unless approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) A nonroad engine conditionally admitted pursuant to § 89.604 and not granted final admission within 120 days of such conditional admission, or within such additional time as the Administrator and the U.S. Customs Service may allow, is deemed to be unlawfully imported into the United States in violation of section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act, unless the nonroad engine has been delivered to the U.S. Customs Service for export or other disposition under applicable Customs laws and regulations. A nonroad engine not so delivered is subject to seizure by the U.S. Customs Service.</P>
              <P>(d) An importer who violates section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act is subject to the provisions of section 209 of the Act and is also subject to a civil penalty under section 205 of the Act of not more than $32,500 for each nonroad engine subject to the violation.</P>
              <P>In addition to the penalty provided in the Act, where applicable, a person or entity who imports an engine under the exemption provisions of § 89.611(b) and, who fails to deliver the nonroad engine to the U.S. Customs Service is liable for liquidated damages in the amount of the bond required by applicable Customs laws and regulations. The maximum penalty value listed in this paragraph (d) is shown for calendar year 2004. Maximum penalty limits for later years may be adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index. The specific regulatory provisions for changing the maximum penalties, published in 40 CFR part 19, reference the applicable U.S. Code citation on which the prohibited action is based.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) An ICI whose nonroad engines imported under § 89.605 or § 89.609 fail to conform to federal emission requirements after modification and/or testing or who fails to comply with applicable provisions of this subpart, may, in addition to any other applicable sanctions and penalties, be subject to any, or all, of the following sanctions:</P>

              <P>(i) The ICI's currently held certificates of conformity may be revoked or suspended;<PRTPAGE P="163"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The ICI may be deemed ineligible to apply for new certificates of conformity for up to three years; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The ICI may be deemed ineligible to import nonroad engines under § 89.609 in the future and be placed on a list of ICIs ineligible to import nonroad engines under the provisions of § 89.609.</P>
              <P>(2) Grounds for the actions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Action or inaction by the ICI or the laboratory performing the emission test on behalf of the ICI, which results in fraudulent, deceitful, or grossly inaccurate representation of any fact or condition which affects a nonroad engine's eligibility for admission to the United States under this subpart;</P>
              <P>(ii) Failure of a significant number of imported nonroad engines to comply with federal emission requirements upon EPA inspection or retest; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Failure by an ICI to comply with requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) The following procedures govern any decision to suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue certificates of conformity under this subpart:</P>
              <P>(i) When grounds appear to exist for the actions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Administrator must notify the ICI in writing of any intended suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity, proposed ineligibility to apply for new certificates of conformity, or intended suspension of eligibility to conduct modification/testing under § 89.609, and the grounds for such action.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided by paragraph (e)(3)(iv), the ICI must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider withdrawing notice of intent to suspend or revoke the ICI's certificate of conformity or to deem the ICI ineligible to apply for new certification or to deem the ICI ineligible to perform modification/testing under § 89.609:</P>
              <P>(A) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the nonroad engine, describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the ICI to prevent the future occurrence of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies are to be implemented or</P>
              <P>(B) Demonstrate that the nonroad engine does in fact comply with applicable regulations in this chapter by retesting, if applicable, the nonroad engine in accordance with the applicable emission test specified in subpart E of this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) An ICI may request, within 15 calendar days of the Administrator's notice of intent to suspend or revoke the ICI's certificate of conformity or to deem the ICI ineligible to apply for new certificates or to deem the ICI ineligible to perform modification/testing under § 89.609, that the Administrator grant such ICI a hearing:</P>
              <P>(A) As to whether the tests, if applicable, have been properly conducted,</P>
              <P>(B) As to any substantial factual issue raised by the Administrator's proposed action.</P>
              <P>(iv) If, after the Administrator notifies an ICI of the intent to suspend or revoke the ICI's certificate of conformity or to deem the ICI ineligible to apply for new certificates or to deem the ICI ineligible to perform modification/testing under § 89.609 and prior to any final suspension or revocation, the ICI demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to initiate suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity or eligibility to perform modification/testing under § 89.609 was based on erroneous information, the Administrator will withdraw the notice of intent.</P>
              <P>(4) Hearings on suspensions and revocations of certificates of conformity or of eligibility to apply for new certificates or of eligibility to perform modification/testing under § 89.609 will be held in accordance with the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The procedures prescribed by this section will apply whenever an ICI requests a hearing pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) Hearings under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) will be held in accordance with the procedures outlined in § 86.614 of this chapter, where applicable, provided that where § 86.612 is referred to in § 86.614: § 86.612(a) is replaced by § 89.612(e)(2); and § 86.612(i) is replaced by § 89.612(e)(3)(iii).<PRTPAGE P="164"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) When a hearing is requested under this section and it clearly appears from the data or other information contained in the request for a hearing, or submitted at the hearing, that no genuine and substantial question of fact exists with respect to the issue of whether the ICI failed to comply with this subpart, the Administrator will enter an order denying the request for a hearing, or terminating the hearing, and suspending or revoking the certificate of conformity and/or deeming the ICI ineligible to apply for new certificates or to perform modification/testing under § 89.609.</P>
              <P>(6) In lieu of requesting a hearing under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, an ICI may respond in writing to EPA's charges in the notice of intent to suspend or revoke. An ICI's written response must be received by EPA within 30 days of the date of EPA's notice of intent. No final decision to suspend or revoke will be made before that time.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Testing exemption.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the following:</P>
              <P>(1) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance with this section;</P>
              <P>(2) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption;</P>
              <P>(3) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; and</P>

              <P>(4) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control consonant <PRTPAGE P="166"/>with the purpose of the test program and EPA's monitoring requirements.</P>
              <P>(5) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each of the four identified elements.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item of information.</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under § 89.1003. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.</P>
              <P>(d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) An estimate of the program's duration, and</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum number of nonroad engines involved.</P>
              <P>(e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) The technical nature of the test;</P>
              <P>(2) The site of the test;</P>
              <P>(3) The time or mileage duration of the test;</P>
              <P>(4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in the test;</P>
              <P>(5) The intended final disposition of the engines;</P>
              <P>(6) The manner in which the engine identification numbers will be identified, recorded, and made available; and</P>
              <P>(7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.</P>
              <P>(f) A manufacturer of new nonroad engines may request a testing exemption to cover nonroad engines intended for use in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. Unless otherwise required by the Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the record-keeping and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) Be affixed in a readily visible portion of the engine,</P>
              <P>(ii) Be attached in such a manner that cannot be removed without destruction or defacement,</P>
              <P>(iii) State in the English language and in block letters and numerals of a color that contrasts with the background of the label, the following information:</P>

              <P>(A) The label heading “Emission Control Information;”<PRTPAGE P="167"/>
              </P>

              <P>(D) The statement “This nonroad engine is exempt from the prohibitions of 40 CFR 89.1003.”</P>
              <P>(4) No provision of paragraph (a)(3) of this section prevents a manufacturer from including any other information it desires on the label.</P>
              <P>(b) Any independent commercial importer that desires a precertification exemption pursuant to § 89.611(b)(3) and is in the business of importing, modifying, or testing uncertified nonroad engines for resale under the provisions of subpart G of this part, must apply to the Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division. The Director may require such independent commercial importer to submit information regarding the general nature of the fleet activities, the number of nonroad engines involved, and a demonstration that adequate record-keeping procedures for control purposes will be employed.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Any nonroad engine, otherwise subject to this part, which is used in a vehicle that exhibits substantial features ordinarily associated with military combat such as armor and/or permanently affixed weaponry and which will be owned and/or used by an agency of the federal government with responsibility for national defense, will be considered exempt from these regulations for purposes of national security. No request for exemption is necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) Manufacturers may request a national security exemption for any nonroad engine, otherwise subject to this part, which does not meet the conditions described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A manufacturer requesting a national security exemption must state the purpose for which the exemption is required and the request must be endorsed by an agency of the federal government charged with responsibility for national defense.</P>
              <P>(b) EPA will maintain a list of models of nonroad engines (and the vehicles which use them) that have been granted a national security exemption under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

              <P>(a) A new nonroad engine intended solely for export, and so labeled or tagged on the outside of the container and on the engine itself, is subject to the provisions of § 89.1003, unless the importing country has new nonroad engine emission standards which differ from EPA standards.<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section, a country having no standards, whatsoever, is deemed to be a country having emission standards which differ from EPA standards.</P>
              <P>(c) EPA will maintain a list of foreign countries that have in force nonroad emission standards identical to EPA standards and have so notified EPA. This list may be obtained by writing to the following address: Chief, Selective Enforcement Auditing Section, Manufacturers Operations Division (6405-J), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. New nonroad engines exported to such countries must comply with EPA certification regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) It is a condition of any exemption for the purpose of export under paragraph (a) of this section, that such exemption is void ab initio with respect to a new nonroad engine intended solely for export, where such nonroad engine is sold, or offered for sale, to an ultimate purchaser or otherwise distributed or introduced into commerce in the United States for purposes other than export.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 89.910</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Granting of exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made pursuant to § 89.905 or § 89.908, EPA determines it is appropriate to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption is to be prepared and submitted to the person requesting the exemption. The memorandum is to set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and such terms and conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and conditions generally include, but are not limited to, agreements by the applicant to conduct the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, create and maintain adequate records accessible to EPA at reasonable times, employ labels for the exempt engines setting forth the nature of the exemption, take appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the exemption are met, and advise EPA of the termination of the activity and the ultimate disposition of the engines.</P>
              <P>(b) Any exemption granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is deemed to cover any subject engine only to the extent that the specified terms and conditions are complied with. A breach of any term or condition causes the exemption to be void ab initio with respect to any engine. Consequently, the causing or the performing of an act prohibited under § 89.1003(a)(1) or (a)(3), other than in strict conformity with all terms and conditions of this exemption, renders the person to whom the exemption is granted, and any other person to whom the provisions of § 89.1003(a) are applicable, liable to suit under sections 204 and 205 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) Manufacturers may ask EPA to apply the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.201(i) to engines exempted or excluded under this subpart.</P>

              <P>(1) Nothing in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is to be construed to require the use of manufacturer parts in maintaining or repairing a nonroad engine.</P>
              <P>(2) Actions for the purpose of repair or replacement of a device or element of design or any other item are not considered prohibited acts under § 89.1003(a) if the action is a necessary and temporary procedure, the device or element is replaced upon completion of the procedure, and the action results in the proper functioning of the device or element of design.</P>
              <P>(3) Actions for the purpose of a conversion of a nonroad engine for use of a clean alternative fuel (as defined in Title II of the Act) are not considered prohibited acts under § 89.1003(a) if:</P>
              <P>(i) the vehicle complies with the applicable standard when operating on the alternative fuel, and the device or element is replaced upon completion of the conversion procedure, and</P>
              <P>(ii) in the case of engines converted to dual fuel or flexible use, the action results in proper functioning of the device or element when the nonroad engine operates on conventional fuel.</P>
              <P>(4) Certified nonroad engines shall be used in all vehicles and equipment manufactured on or after the applicable model years in § 89.112 that are self-propelled, portable, transportable, or are intended to be propelled while performing their function, unless the manufacturer of the vehicle or equipment can prove that the vehicle or equipment will be used in a manner consistent with paragraph (2) of the definition of nonroad engine in § 89.2. After the date on which a new standard takes effect, nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers may continue to use nonroad engines built prior to this date that are not certified to the standard until inventories of those engines are depleted; however, stockpiling of such nonroad engines will be considered a violation of this section.</P>
              <P>(5)-(6) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(7) A new nonroad engine intended solely to replace a nonroad engine in a piece of nonroad equipment, where the engine requiring replacement is not certified or is certified to emission standards that are less stringent than those in effect when the replacement engine is built, shall not be subject to the prohibitions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section or to the requirements of <PRTPAGE P="171"/>§ 89.105 and paragraph (b)(4) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The engine manufacturer has ascertained that no engine produced by itself or by the manufacturer of the engine that is being replaced, if different, and certified to the requirements of this subpart, is available with the appropriate physical or performance characteristics to repower the equipment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The engine manufacturer or its agent takes ownership and possession of the engine being replaced or confirms that the engine has been destroyed; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If the engine being replaced was not subject to any emission standards under this part, the replacement engine must have a permanent label with your corporate name and trademark and the following language, or similar alternate language approved by the Administrator: THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH FEDERAL NONROAD OR ON-HIGHWAY EMISSION REQUIREMENTS. SALE OR INSTALLATION OF THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN AS A REPLACEMENT ENGINE FOR AN ENGINE MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1 [INSERT APPROPRIATE YEAR] IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the engine being replaced was subject to emission standards less stringent than those in effect when you produce the replacement engine, the replacement engine must have a permanent label with your corporate name and trademark and the following language, or similar alternate language approved by the Administrator:</P>
              <P>THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA NONROAD EMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR [Identify the appropriate emission standards (by model year, tier, or emission levels) for the replaced engine] ENGINES UNDER 40 CFR 89.1003(b)(7). SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO REPLACE A [Identify the appropriate emission standards (by model year, tier, or emission levels) for the replaced engine] ENGINE MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.</P>
              <P>(v) If the old engine was subject to emission standards less stringent than those in effect when you produce the replacement engine, you must make the replacement engine in a configuration identical in all material respects to the old engine. You may alternatively make the replacement engine in a configuration identical in all material respects to another certified engine of the same or later model year, as long as the engine is not certified with a family emission limit higher than that of the engine being replaced.</P>
              <P>(vi) Engines sold pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (b)(7) will neither generate nor use emission credits and will not be part of any accounting under the averaging, banking and trading program.</P>
              <P>(vii) In cases where an engine is to be imported for replacement purposes under the provisions of this paragraph (b)(7), the term “engine manufacturer” shall not apply to an individual or other entity that does not possess a current Certificate of Conformity issued by EPA under this part; and</P>
              <P>(viii) The provisions of this section may not be used to circumvent emission standards that apply to new engines under this part.</P>

The manufacturer shall <PRTPAGE P="172"/>comply in all respects with the requirements of subpart I of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of enforcement of this part, an officer or employee duly designated by the Administrator, upon presenting appropriate credentials, is authorized:</P>
              <P>(i) To enter, at reasonable times, any establishment of the manufacturer, or of any person whom the manufacturer engaged to perform any activity required under paragraph (a) (1) of this section, for the purposes of inspecting or observing any activity conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and</P>
              <P>(ii) To inspect records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities used in performing an activity required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, by the manufacturer or by a person whom the manufacturer engaged to perform the activity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemption provision.</E> The Administrator may exempt a new nonroad engine from § 89.1003 upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator may find necessary for the purpose of export, research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, or for reasons of national security.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Importation provision.</E> (1) A new nonroad engine, vehicle, or equipment offered for importation or imported by a person in violation of § 89.1003 is to be refused admission into the United States, but the Secretary of the Treasury and the Administrator may, by joint regulation, provide for deferring a final determination as to admission and authorizing the delivery of such a nonroad engine offered for import to the owner or consignee thereof upon such terms and conditions (including the furnishing of a bond) as may appear to them appropriate to insure that the nonroad engine will be brought into conformity with the standards, requirements, and limitations applicable to it under this part.</P>
              <P>(2) If a nonroad engine is finally refused admission under this paragraph, the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause disposition thereof in accordance with the customs laws unless it is exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of notice of the refusal or additional time as may be permitted pursuant to the regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) Disposition in accordance with the customs laws may not be made in such manner as may result, directly or indirectly, in the sale, to the ultimate consumer, of a new nonroad engine that fails to comply with applicable standards of the Administrator under this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Export provision.</E> A new nonroad engine intended solely for export, and so labeled or tagged on the outside of the container and on the engine itself, shall be subject to the provisions of § 89.1003, except that if the country that is to receive the engine has emission standards that differ from the standards prescribed under subpart B of this part, then the engine must comply with the standards of the country that is to receive the engine.</P>

              <P>(1) A person who violates § 89.1003(a)(1), (a)(4), or (a)(6), or a manufacturer or dealer who violates § 89.1003(a)(3)(i), is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $32,500 for each violation.</P>
              <P>(2) A person other than a manufacturer or dealer who violates § 89.1003(a)(3)(i) or any person who violates § 89.1003(a)(3)(ii) is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $2,750 for each violation.</P>

              <P>(3) A violation with respect to § 89.1003 (a)(1), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4), or (a)(6) constitutes a separate offense with respect to each nonroad engine.<PRTPAGE P="173"/>
              </P>

              <P>(5) A person who violates § 89.1003(a)(2) or (a)(5) is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $32,500 per day of violation.</P>
              <P>(6) The maximum penalty values listed in this section are shown for calendar year 2004. Maximum penalty limits for later years may be adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index. The specific regulatory provisions for changing the maximum penalties, published in 40 CFR part 19, reference the applicable U.S. Code citation on which the prohibited action is based.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Civil actions.</E> The Administrator may commence a civil action to assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the defendant resides or has the Administrator's principal place of business, and the court has jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under this paragraph, the court is to take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(3) In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative assessment of certain penalties</E>—(1) Administrative penalty authority. In lieu of commencing a civil action under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator may assess any civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty assessment proceeding shall not exceed $270,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty shall be by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions, any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determining amount.</E> In determining the amount of any civil penalty assessed under this paragraph, the Administrator shall take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of administrator's action.</E> (i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph does not affect or limit the Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of the Act; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this paragraph, or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this paragraph shall not be the subject of a civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) No action by the Administrator under this paragraph shall affect a person's obligation to comply with a section of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Finality of order.</E> An order issued under this subsection is to become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this subsection may seek review of the assessment in the <PRTPAGE P="174"/>United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principal place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. The person shall simultaneously send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the court within 30 days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Collection.</E> (i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the date of the final order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty is not subject to review.</P>
              <P>(ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section shall be required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to ten percent of the aggregate amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Warranty provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The manufacturer of each nonroad engine must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the engine is designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and is free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period (as determined under § 89.104).</P>
              <P>(b) In the case of a nonroad engine part, the manufacturer or rebuilder of the part may certify according to § 85.2112 that use of the part will not result in a failure of the engine to comply with emission standards promulgated in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any nonroad engine warranted under this part is responsible for the proper maintenance of the engine. Proper maintenance includes replacement and service, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, of all parts, items, or devices related to emission control (but not designed for emission control) under the terms of the last sentence of section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is covered by any warranty not mandated by this Act.</P>

              <P>(a) Effective with respect to nonroad vehicles, equipment, and engines manufactured during model years 1996 and after:</P>

              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that a substantial number of any class <PRTPAGE P="175"/>or category of engines, although properly maintained and used, do not conform to the regulations prescribed under section 213 of the Act when in actual use throughout their recall period (as defined under § 89.104(b)), the Administrator shall immediately notify the manufacturer of such nonconformity and require the manufacturer to submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity of the engines with respect to which such notification is given.</P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer's plan shall provide that the nonconformity of any such engines which are properly used and maintained will be remedied at the expense of the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the manufacturer disagrees with such determination of nonconformity and so advises the Administrator, the Administrator shall afford the manufacturer and other interested persons an opportunity to present their views and evidence in support thereof at a public hearing. Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing, order the manufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The manufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of subpart G of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to any class or category of engines shall be given to dealers, ultimate purchasers, and subsequent purchasers (if known) in such manner and containing such information as required in subparts H and I of this part.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The manufacturer shall furnish with each new nonroad engine written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the engine by the ultimate purchaser as required under § 89.109. The manufacturer shall provide in boldface type on the first page of the written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance, replacement, or repair of the emission control devices and systems may be performed by any nonroad engine repair establishment or individual using any nonroad engine part which has been certified as provided in § 89.1007(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) The instruction under paragraph (3)(i) of this section must not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's using, in connection with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Subject instructions also must not directly or indirectly distinguish between service performed by the franchised dealers of such manufacturer, or any other service establishments with which such manufacturer has a commercial relationship, and service performed by independent nonroad engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer has no commercial relationship.</P>
              <P>(iii) The prohibition of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may be waived by the Administrator if:</P>
              <P>(A) The manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the engine will function properly only if the component or service so identified is used in connection with such engine, and</P>
              <P>(B) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(iv) In addition, the manufacturer shall indicate by means of a label or tag permanently affixed to the engine that the engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued for the purpose of assuring achievement of emission standards prescribed under section 213 of the Act. This label or tag shall also contain information relating to control of emissions as prescribed under § 89.110.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer bears all cost obligation a dealer incurs as a result of a requirement imposed by paragraph (a) of this section. The transfer of any such cost obligation from a manufacturer to a dealer through franchise or other agreement is prohibited.</P>

              <P>(c) If a manufacturer includes in an advertisement a statement respecting the cost or value of emission control devices or systems, the manufacturer shall set forth in the statement the cost or value attributed to these devices or systems by the Secretary of Labor (through the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The Secretary of Labor, <PRTPAGE P="176"/>and his or her representatives, has the same access for this purpose to the books, documents, papers, and records of a manufacturer as the Comptroller General has to those of a recipient of assistance for purposes of section 311 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(d) Any inspection of a nonroad engine for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, after its sale to the ultimate purchaser, is to be made only if the owner of such vehicle or engine voluntarily permits such inspection to be made, except as may be provided by any state or local inspection program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part applies to new nonroad spark-ignition engines and vehicles with gross power output at or below 19 kilowatts (kW) used for any purpose, unless we exclude them under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) In certain cases, the regulations in this part 90 also apply to new engines with a gross power output above 19 kW that would otherwise be covered by 40 CFR part 1048 or 1051. See 40 CFR 1048.615 or 1051.145(a)(3) for provisions related to this allowance.</P>
              <P>(c) In certain cases, the regulations in this part 90 apply to new engines below 50 cc used in motorcycles that are motor vehicles. See 40 CFR 86.447-2006 for provisions related to this allowance.</P>
              <P>(d) The following nonroad engines and vehicles are not subject to the provisions of this part:</P>

              <P>(1) Engines that are certified to meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 1051 or are otherwise subject to 40 CFR part 1051 (for example, engines used in snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles). This part nevertheless applies to engines used in recreational vehicles if the manufacturer uses the provisions of 40 CFR 1051.145(a)(3) to exempt them from the requirements of 40 CFR part 1051. Compliance with the provisions of this part is a required condition of that exemption.<PRTPAGE P="179"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Engines used in highway motorcycles. See 40 CFR part 86, subpart E.</P>
              <P>(3) Propulsion marine engines. See 40 CFR part 91. This part applies with respect to auxiliary marine engines.</P>
              <P>(4) Engines used in aircraft. See 40 CFR part 87.</P>
              <P>(5) Engines certified to meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 1048 or are otherwise subject to 40 CFR part 1048, subject to the provisions of § 90.913.</P>
              <P>(6) Hobby engines.</P>
              <P>(7) Engines that are used exclusively in emergency and rescue equipment where no certified engines are available to power the equipment safely and practically, but not including generators, alternators, compressors or pumps used to provide remote power to a rescue tool. The equipment manufacturer bears the responsibility to ascertain on an annual basis and maintain documentation available to the Administrator that no appropriate certified engine is available from any source.</P>
              <P>(8) Engines that are subject to emission standards under 40 CFR part 1054. See 40 CFR 1054.1 to determine when part 1054 applies. Note that certain requirements and prohibitions apply to engines built on or after January 1, 2010 if they are installed in equipment that will be used solely for competition, as described in 40 CFR 1054.1 and 40 CFR 1068.1; those provisions apply instead of the provisions of this part 90.</P>
              <P>(e) Engines subject to the provisions of this subpart are also subject to the provisions found in subparts B through N of this part, except that Subparts C, H, M and N of this part apply only to Phase 2 engines as defined in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f) Certain text in this part is identified as pertaining to Phase 1 or Phase 2 engines. Such text pertains only to engines of the specified Phase. If no indication of Phase is given, the text pertains to all engines, regardless of Phase.</P>
              <P>(g) This part also applies to engines under 50 cc used in motorcycles that are motor vehicles if the manufacturer uses the provisions of 40 CFR 86.447-2006 to meet the emission standards in this part instead of the requirements of 40 CFR part 86. In this case, compliance with the provisions of this part is a required condition of that exemption.</P>
              <P>(h) This part applies as specified in 40 CFR part 60 subpart JJJJ, to spark-ignition engines subject to the standards of 40 CFR part 60, subpart JJJJ.</P>

              <P>(2) For engines not using assigned dfs from Table 1 or Table 2 of paragraph (g) of this section, dfs shall be determined as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) On at least one test engine representing the configuration chosen to be the most likely to exceed HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> (NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>) emission standards, (FELs where applicable), and constructed to be representative of production engines pursuant to § 90.117, conduct full Federal test procedure emission testing pursuant to the regulations of subpart E of this part at the number of hours representing stabilized emissions pursuant to § 90.118. If more than one engine is tested, average the results and round to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard, expressed to one additional significant figure;</P>
              <P>(ii) Conduct such emission testing again following aging the engine. The aging procedure should be designed to allow the manufacturer to appropriately predict the in-use emission deterioration expected over the useful life of the engine, taking into account the type of wear and other deterioration mechanisms expected under typical consumer use which could affect emissions performance. If more than one engine is tested, average the results and round to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard, expressed to one additional significant figure;</P>

              <P>(iii) Divide the full useful life emissions (average emissions, if applicable) for each regulated pollutant by the stabilized emissions (average emissions, if <PRTPAGE P="190"/>applicable) and round to two significant figures. The resulting number shall be the df, unless it is less than 1.0, in which case the df shall be 1.0.</P>

              <P>(iv) At the manufacturer's option additional emission test points can be scheduled between the stabilized emission test point and the full useful life test period. If intermediate tests are scheduled, the test points must be evenly spaced over the full useful life period (plus or minus 2 hours) and one such test point shall be at one-half of full useful life (plus or minus 2 hours). For each pollutant HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> (NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>) and CO, a line must be fitted to the data points treating the initial test as occurring at hour zero, and using the method of least-squares. The deterioration factor is the calculated emissions durability period divided by the calculated emissions at zero hours.</P>
              <P>(3) EPA may reject a df if it has evidence that the df is not appropriate for that family within 30 days of receipt from the manufacturer. The manufacturer must retain actual emission test data to support its choice of df and furnish that data to the Administrator upon request. Manufacturers may request approval by the Administrator of alternate procedures for determining deterioration. Any submitted df not rejected by EPA within 30 days shall be deemed to have been approved.</P>
              <P>(4) Calculated deterioration factors may cover families and model years in addition to the one upon which they were generated if the manufacturer submits a justification acceptable to the Administrator in advance of certification that the affected engine families can be reasonably expected to have similar emission deterioration characteristics.</P>
              <P>(5) Engine families that undergo running changes need not generate a new df if the manufacturer submits a justification acceptable to the Administrator concurrent with the running change that the affected engine families can be reasonably expected to have similar emission deterioration characteristics.</P>

Engines that operate only at intermediate speed must use Test Cycle A, which is described in table 2 of appendix A to subpart E of this part. Engines that operate only at rated speed must use Test Cycle B, which is described in table 2 of appendix A to subpart E of this part. If an engine family includes engines used in both rated-speed and intermediate-speed applications, the manufacturer must select the duty cycle that will result in worst-case emission results for certification. For any testing after certification, the engine must be tested using the most appropriate test cycle based on the engine's installed governor.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrator testing.</E> (1) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the test engines be submitted to the Administrator, at such place or places as the Administrator may designate, for the purposes of conducting emission tests. The Administrator may specify that testing will be conducted at the manufacturer's facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment specified by the Administrator must be made available by the manufacturer for test operations. Any testing conducted at a manufacturer's facility must be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as possible.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test engine, the results of that test will, unless subsequently invalidated by the Administrator, comprise the official data for the engine and the manufacturer's data will not be used in determining compliance with emission standards.<PRTPAGE P="200"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Prior to the performance of such test, the Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any adjustable parameter of the test engine which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing, to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, to determine whether such engine conforms to applicable emission standards.</P>
              <P>(iii) For those engine parameters which the Administrator has not determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing, the test engine presented to the Administrator for testing will be calibrated within the production tolerances applicable to the manufacturer specification shown on the engine label or in the owner's manual, as specified in the application for certification.</P>

              <P>(i) A preliminary determination has been made that a part failure or system malfunction, or the repair of such failure or malfunction, does not render the engine unrepresentative of engines in use, and does not require direct access to the combustion chamber; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A determination has been made that the need for maintenance or repairs is indicated by an overt malfunction such as persistent misfire, engine stall, overheating, fluid leakage, or loss of oil pressure.</P>
              <P>(3) Emission measurements may not be used as a means of determining the need for unscheduled maintenance under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The Administrator must have the opportunity to verify the extent of any overt indication of part failure (for example, misfire, stall), or an activation of an audible and/or visual signal, prior to the manufacturer performing any maintenance related to such overt indication or signal.</P>
              <P>(5) Unless approved by the Administrator prior to use, engine manufacturers may not use any equipment, instruments, or tools to identify malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools are available at dealerships and other service outlets and are used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such components.</P>
              <P>(6) If the Administrator determines that part failure or system malfunction occurrence and/or repair rendered the engine unrepresentative of production engines, the engine cannot be used as a test engine.</P>
              <P>(7) Unless waived by the Administrator, complete emission tests are required before and after any engine maintenance which may reasonably be expected to affect emissions.</P>

Notification occurs when the manufacturer submits an amendment to the original application prior to either producing such engines or making such changes to a product line.</P>
              <P>(b) The amendment must request that the engine manufacturer's existing certificate of conformity be amended and include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) A full description of the engine to be added or the change(s) to be made in production;</P>

              <P>(2) Alternatively, new nonhandheld engines and equipment must use only fuel lines that meet standards that apply for these engines and equipment in California for the same model year (see 40 CFR 1060.810). This may involve SHED-based measurements for equipment or testing with fuel lines alone. If this involves SHED-based measurements, all elements of the emission control system must remain in place for fully assembled engines and equipment.<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The emission standards in this section apply with respect to discrete fuel line segments of any length. Compliance may also be demonstrated using aggregated systems that include multiple sections of fuel line with connectors, and fittings. The standard applies with respect to the total permeation emissions divided by the wetted internal surface area of the assembly. Where it is not practical to determine the wetted internal surface area of the assembly, the internal surface area per unit length of the assembly may be assumed to be equal to the ratio of internal surface area per unit length of the hose section of the assembly.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The certification averaging, banking, and trading provisions for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions from eligible engines are described in this subpart.</P>

              <P>(b) An engine family may use the averaging, banking and trading provisions for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions if it is subject to regulation under this part with certain exceptions specified in paragraph (c) of this section. HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> credits shall be interchangeable subject to the limitations on credit generation, credit usage, and other provisions described in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) A manufacturer shall not include in its calculation of credit generation and may exclude from its calculation of credit usage, any new engines:</P>
              <P>(1) Which are intended to be exported, unless the manufacturer has reason or should have reason to believe that such engines have been or will be imported in a piece of equipment; or</P>
              <P>(2) Which are subject to state engine emission standards pursuant to a waiver granted by EPA under section 209(e) of the Act, unless the manufacturer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that inclusion of these engines in averaging, banking and trading is appropriate.</P>

              <P>(d) For an engine family using credits, a manufacturer may, at its option, include its entire production of that <PRTPAGE P="207"/>engine family in its calculation of credit usage for a given model year.</P>
              <P>(e) (1) A manufacturer may certify engine families at Family Emission Limits (FELs) above or below the applicable emission standard subject to the limitation in paragraph (f) of this section, provided the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of credits from all calculations and credit transactions for all engine classes in a given model year is greater than or equal to zero, as determined under § 90.207. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a manufacturer may project a negative balance of credits as allowed under § 90.207(c)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) A manufacturer of an engine family with an FEL exceeding the applicable emission standard must obtain positive emission credits sufficient to address the associated credit shortfall via averaging, banking, or trading.</P>
              <P>(3) A nonhandheld engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard may generate positive emission credits for averaging, banking, or trading, or a combination thereof. A handheld engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard may generate positive emission credits for averaging or trading. A handheld engine family meeting the requirements of § 90.205(a)(4) or (5), whichever is applicable, may generate positive emission credits for banking.</P>
              <P>(4) In the case of a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) failure, credits may be used to cover subsequent production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy a nonconformity determined by an SEA, except that the Administrator may permit the use of credits to address a nonconformity determined by an SEA where the use of such credits is one component of a multi-part remedy for the previously produced engines and the remedy, including the use of credits and the quantity of credits being used, is such that the Administrator is satisfied that the manufacturer has strong and lasting incentive to accurately verify its new engine emission levels and will set or reset its FELs for current and future model years so that production line compliance is assured.</P>
              <P>(5) In the case of a production line testing (PLT) failure pursuant to subpart H of this part, a manufacturer may revise the FEL based upon production line testing results obtained under subpart H of this part and upon Administrator approval pursuant to § 90.122(d). The manufacturer may use credits to cover both past production and subsequent production of the engines as needed as allowed under § 90.207(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(f) No Phase 2 engine family may have a HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FEL that is greater than 32.2 g/kW-hr for Class I engines, 94 g/kW-hr for Class I-A engines, 50 g/kW-hr for Class I-B engines, 26.8 g/kW-hr for Class II engines, 336 g/kW-hr for Class III engines, 275 g/kW-hr for Class IV engines, or 186 g/kW-hr for Class V engines.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) Credits generated in a given model year by an engine family subject to the Phase 2 emission requirements may only be used in averaging, banking or trading, as appropriate, for any other engine family for which the Phase 2 requirements are applicable. Credits generated in one model year may not be used for prior model years, except as allowed under § 90.207(c).</P>

              <P>(2) For the 2005 model year and for each subsequent model year, manufacturers of Class II engines must provide a demonstration that the production weighted average FEL for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> (including NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FELs), for all of the manufacturer's Class II engines, will not exceed 13.6 g/kW-hr for the 2005 model year, 13.1 g/kW-hr for the 2006 model year and 12.6 g/kW-hr for the 2007 and each subsequent Phase 2 model year. Such demonstration shall be subject to the review and approval of the Administrator, shall be provided at the time of the first Class II certification of that model year and shall be based on projected eligible production for that model year.</P>

              <P>(h) Manufacturers must demonstrate compliance under the averaging, banking, and trading provisions for a particular model year by 270 days after the end of the model year. Except as provided in § 90.207(c), an engine family generating negative credits for which the manufacturer does not obtain or generate an adequate number of positive credits by that date from the same <PRTPAGE P="208"/>or previous model year engines will violate the conditions of the certificate of conformity. The certificate of conformity may be voided <E T="03">ab initio</E> pursuant to § 90.123 for this engine family.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Beginning August 1, 2007, a manufacturer of a Class I engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard for a given model year may bank credits in that model year for use in averaging and trading. For new Class I engine families initially produced during the period starting August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2007, a manufacturer of a Class I engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard for a given model year may bank credits in that model year for use in averaging and trading.</P>
              <P>(2) Beginning with the 2000 model year, a manufacturer of a Class I-A or Class I-B engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard for a given model year may bank credits in that model year for use in averaging and trading.</P>
              <P>(3) Beginning with the 2001 model year, a manufacturer of a Class II engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard for a given model year may bank credits in that model year for use in averaging and trading.</P>
              <P>(4) For the 2002 model year, a manufacturer of a Class III or Class IV engine family may bank credits for use in future model year averaging and trading from only those Class III or Class IV engine families with an FEL at or below 72 g/kW-hr. Beginning with the 2003 model year, a manufacturer of a Class III or Class IV engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard may generate credits for use in future model year averaging and trading.</P>
              <P>(5) Beginning with the 2004 model year, a manufacturer of a Class V engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard may generate credits for use in future model year averaging and trading.</P>
              <P>(6) Negative credits may be banked only according to the requirements under § 90.207(c).</P>

              <P>(b)(1) For Class I engine families initially produced during the period beginning with the 1999 model year and prior to August 1, 2003, a manufacturer may bank early credits for engines with HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FELs below 16.1 g/kW-hr. All early credits for such Class I engines shall be calculated against a HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> level of 20.5 g/kW-hr and may continue to be calculated against the 20.5 g/kW-hr level until August 1, 2007.</P>

              <P>(2) Beginning with the 1999 model year and prior to the applicable date listed in paragraph (a) of this section <PRTPAGE P="209"/>for Class II engines, a manufacturer may bank early credits for all Class II engines with HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FELs below 12.1 g/kW-hr.

              <P>(3) Beginning with the 2000 model year and prior to the applicable date listed in paragraph (a) of this section for Class III engines, a manufacturer may bank early credits for all Class III engines with HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FELs below 72 g/kW-hr. All early credits for Class III engines shall be calculated against a HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> level of 238 g/kW-hr.</P>

              <P>(4) Beginning with the 2000 model year and prior to the applicable date listed in paragraph (a) of this section for Class IV engines, a manufacturer may bank early credits for all Class IV engines with HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FELs below 72 g/kW-hr. All early credits for Class IV engines shall be calculated against a HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> level of 196 g/kW-hr.</P>

              <P>(5) Beginning with the 2000 model year and prior to the applicable date listed in paragraph (a) of this section for Class V engines, a manufacturer may bank early credits for all Class V engines with HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FELs below 87 g/kW-hr. All early credits for Class V engines shall be calculated against a HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> level of 143 g/kW-hr.</P>
              <P>(6) Engines certified under the early banking provisions of this paragraph are subject to all of the requirements of this part applicable to Phase 2 engines.</P>
              <P>(c) A manufacturer may bank actual credits only after the end of the model year and after EPA has reviewed the manufacturer's end-of-year reports. During the model year and before submittal of the end-of-year report, credits originally designated in the certification process for banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for trading or averaging in the end-of-year report and final report.</P>
              <P>(d) Credits declared for banking from the previous model year that have not been reviewed by EPA may be used in averaging or trading transactions. However, such credits may be revoked at a later time following EPA review of the end-of-year report or any subsequent audit actions.</P>

              <P>(b) Manufacturer compliance with the emission standards is determined on a corporate average basis at the end of each model year. A manufacturer is in compliance when the sum of positive and negative emission credits it holds is greater than or equal to zero, except that the sum of positive and negative credits may be less than zero as allowed under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If, as a result of production line testing as required in subpart H of this part, an engine family is determined to be in noncompliance pursuant to § 90.710, the manufacturer may raise its FEL for past and future production as necessary. Further, a manufacturer may carry a negative credit balance (known also as a credit deficit) for the subject class and model year and for the next three model years. The credit deficit may be no larger than that created by the nonconforming family. If the credit deficit still exists after the model year following the model year in which the nonconformity occurred, the manufacturer must obtain and apply credits to offset the remaining credit deficit at a rate of 1.2 grams for each gram of deficit within the next two model years. The provisions of this paragraph are subject to the limitations in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c)(2) For model years 2004 through 2007, an engine manufacturer who certifies at least one Class V engine family in a given model year may carry forward a credit deficit for four model years, but must not carry such deficit into the fifth year, provided the deficit is attributable to negative credits from its Class V engine families, subject to the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(i) Credit deficits are permitted for model years 2004 through 2007 but cannot occur for more than two consecutive model years for a given manufacturer;</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) If an engine manufacturer calculates that it has a credit deficit for a given model year, it must obtain sufficient credits from engine families produced by itself or another manufacturer in a model year no later than the fourth model year following the model year for which it calculated the credit deficit. (Example: if a manufacturer calculates that it has a credit deficit for the 2004 model year, it must obtain sufficient credits to offset that deficit from its own production or that of other manufacturers' 2008 or earlier model year engine families.);</P>

              <P>(B) An engine manufacturer carrying the deficit into the first model year following the year in which it was generated must generate or obtain credits to offset that deficit and apply them to the deficit at a rate of 1:1. An engine manufacturer carrying the deficit into the second and third model years must generate or obtain credits to offset that deficit and apply them to the deficit at a rate of 1.1:1 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> deficits carried into the second and third model year must be repaid with credits equal to 110 percent of the deficit). Deficits carried into the fourth model year <PRTPAGE P="211"/>must be offset by credits at a rate of 1.2:1 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 120 percent of the deficit);</P>
              <P>(iii) An engine manufacturer who has a credit deficit may use credits from any class of spark-ignition nonroad engines at or below 19 kilowatts generated or obtained through averaging, banking or trading to offset the credit deficit; and,</P>
              <P>(iv) An engine manufacturer must not bank credits for future use or trade credits to another engine manufacturer during a model year in which it has generated a deficit or into which it has carried a deficit.</P>
              <P>(d) Regulations elsewhere in this part notwithstanding, if an engine manufacturer experiences two or more production line testing failures pursuant to the regulations in subpart H of this part in a given model year, the manufacturer may raise the FEL of previously produced engines only to the extent that such engines represent no more than 10 percent of the manufacturer's total eligible production for that model year, as determined on the date when the FEL is adjusted. For any additional engine families determined to be in noncompliance, the manufacturer must conduct offsetting projects approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(e) If, as a result of production line testing under this subpart, a manufacturer desires to lower its FEL it may do so subject to § 90.708(c).</P>

              <P>(f) Except as allowed at paragraph (c) of this section, when a manufacturer is not in compliance with the applicable emission standard by the date 270 days after the end of the model year, considering all credit calculations and transactions completed by then, the manufacturer will be in violation of the regulations in this part and EPA may, pursuant to § 90.123, void <E T="03">ab initio</E> the certificates of engine families for which the manufacturer has not obtained sufficient positive emission credits.</P>
              <P>(g) Credit deficits. (1) Manufacturers must offset any deficits for a given model year by the reporting deadline for the fourth model year following the model year in which the deficits were generated as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Manufacturers may offset deficits by generating credits or acquiring credits generated by another manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section within the required timeframe for offsetting deficits will be considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the certificate(s) was issued and the individual noncomplying engines not covered by the certificate must be determined according to this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) If deficits are not offset within the specified time period, the number of engines which could not be covered in the calculation to show compliance with the fleet average HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> standard in the model year in which the deficit occurred and thus are not covered by the certificate must be calculated using the methodology described in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) EPA will determine the engines for which the condition on the certificate was not satisfied by designating engines in the Class V engine family with the highest HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> FELs first and continuing progressively downward through the Class V engine families until a number of engines having a credit need, as calculated under paragraph (a) of this section, equal to the remaining deficit is reached. If this calculation determines that only a portion of engines in a Class V engine family contribute to the deficit situation, then EPA will designate a subset of actual engines in that engine family as not covered by the certificate, starting with the last engine produced and counting backwards. EPA may request additional information from the manufacturer that would help identify the actual engine not covered by the certificate.</P>
              <P>(iv) In determining the engine count, EPA will calculate the mass of credits based on the factors identified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) If a manufacturer is purchased by, merges with or otherwise combines with another manufacturer, the manufacturer continues to be responsible for offsetting any deficits outstanding within the required time period. Any failure to offset the deficits will be considered to be a violation of paragraph (g)(1) of this section and may <PRTPAGE P="212"/>subject the manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of engines not covered by a certificate, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If a manufacturer that has a deficit ceases production of handheld engines, the manufacturer will be considered immediately in violation of paragraph (g)(1) of this section and may be subject to an enforcement action for sale of engines not covered by a certificate, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section</P>
              <P>(5) For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, a violation of the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate(s) was issued and hence a sale of engines not covered by the certificate, all occur upon the expiration of the deadline for offsetting deficits specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) End-of-year and final reports must indicate the engine family, the engine class, the actual production volume, the values required to calculate credits as given in § 90.207, and the number of credits generated/required. Manufacturers must also submit how and where credit surpluses were dispersed (or are to be banked) and/or how and through what means credit deficits were met. Copies of contracts related to credit trading must be included or supplied by the broker, if applicable. The report must include a calculation of credit balances to show that the credit summation for all engines is equal to or greater than zero (or less than zero in cases of negative credit balances as permitted in § 90.207(c)). For model year 2005 and later, the report must include a calculation of the production weighted average HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> (including NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>) FEL for Class II engine families to show compliance with the provisions of § 90.203(g)(2).</P>
              <P>(b) The calculation of eligible production for end-of-year and final reports must be based on engines produced for the United States market, excluding engines which are subject to state emission standards pursuant to a waiver granted by EPA under section 209(e) of the Act. Upon advance written request, the Administrator will consider other methods to track engines for credit calculation purposes that provide high levels of confidence that eligible production or sales are accurately counted.</P>
              <P>(c)(1)End-of-year reports must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the model year to: Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group (6403-J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460.</P>

              <P>(d) Failure by a manufacturer to submit any end-of-year or final reports in the specified time for any engines subject to regulation under this part is a violation of § 90.1003(a)(2) and section 213(d) of the Clean Air Act for each engine.</P>
              <P>(e) A manufacturer generating credits for banking only who fails to submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (90 days after the end of the model year) may not use the credits until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits pending EPA review is not permitted in these circumstances.</P>

              <P>(g) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an end-of-year or final report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations must be recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Erroneous negative credit balances may be adjusted by EPA.</P>
              <P>(h) If EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the manufacturer discovers such an error within 270 days of the end of the model year, EPA shall restore the credits for use by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(i) For 2007 and later model years, include in your end-of-year and final reports an accounting to show a separate balance of emission credits for handheld and nonhandheld engines.

              <P>(a) This subpart describes the equipment required in order to perform exhaust emission tests on new nonroad spark-ignition engines and vehicles subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part. Certain text in this subpart is identified as pertaining to Phase 1 or Phase 2 engines. Such text pertains only to engines of the specified Phase. If no indication of Phase is given, the text pertains to all engines, regardless of Phase.</P>
              <P>(b) Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test engine is operated using a steady state test cycle on an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis determining concentration of pollutant. Emission concentrations are converted to mass emission rates in grams per hour based on either fuel flow, fuel flow and engine intake air flow, or exhaust volume flow. Weighted emission rates are reported as grams per brake-kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr). See subpart E of this part for a complete description of the test procedure.</P>
              <P>(c) Additional information about system design, calibration methodologies, and so forth, for raw gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR part 1065. Examples for system design, calibration methodologies, and so forth, for dilute exhaust gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR part 1065.</P>
              <P>(d) For Phase 2 Class I, Phase 2 Class I-B, and Phase 2 Class II natural gas fueled engines, use the procedures of 40 CFR part 1065 to measure nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) exhaust emissions from Phase 2 Class I, Phase 2 Class I-B, and Phase 2 Class II natural gas fueled engines.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Precision.</E> The precision of the analyzer must be, at worst, two percent of full-scale concentration for each range used. The precision is defined as 2.5 times the standard deviation(s) of 10 repetitive responses to a given calibration or span gas.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Noise.</E> The analyzer peak-to-peak response to zero and calibration or span gases over any 10-second period must not exceed two percent of full-scale chart deflection on all ranges used.</P>

The analyzer span is defined as the difference between the span-response and the zero-response. The span-response is defined as the mean response including noise to a span gas during a 30-second time interval.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Operating procedure for analyzers and sampling system.</E> Follow the start-up and operating instructions of the instrument manufacturer or use good engineering practice. Adhere to the minimum requirements given in §§ 90.316 through 90.325 and § 90.409.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Emission measurement accuracy—Bag sampling.</E> (1) Good engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample analyzer readings below 15 percent of full-scale chart deflection should generally not be used.</P>

              <P>(2) Some high resolution read-out systems, such as computers, data loggers, and so forth, can provide sufficient accuracy and resolution below 15 percent of full scale. Such systems may be used provided that additional calibrations are made to ensure the accuracy of the calibration curves. The following procedure for calibration below 15 percent of full scale may be used:

                <P>If a gas divider is used, the gas divider must conform to the accuracy requirements as follows. The use of precision blending devices (gas dividers) to obtain the required calibration gas concentrations is acceptable, provided that the blended gases are accurate to within ±1.5 percent of NIST gas standards or other gas standards which have been approved by the Administrator. This accuracy implies that primary gases used for blending must be “named” to an accuracy of at least ±one percent, traceable to NIST or other approved gas standards.</P>

This gas must be “named” to an accuracy of ±one percent of NIST gas standards or other standards approved by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(iv) Using the calibration curve fitted to the points generated in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, check the concentration of the gas selected in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. The concentration derived from the curve <PRTPAGE P="220"/>must be within ±2.3 percent (±2.8 percent for CO<E T="52">2</E> span gas) of the gas's original named concentration.</P>
              <P>(v) Provided the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section are met, use the gas divider with the gas selected in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section and determine the remainder of the calibration points. Fit a calibration curve per §§ 90.316, 90.317, 90.318, and 90.320 of this chapter for the entire analyzer range.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Emission measurement accuracy—continuous sampling.</E> Analyzers used for continuous analysis must be operated such that the measured concentration falls between 15 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection. Exceptions to these limits are:</P>
              <P>(1) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent or more than 100 percent of full scale if automatic range change circuitry is used and the limits for range changes are between 15 and 100 percent of full-scale chart deflection;</P>
              <P>(2) The analyzer's response may be less than 15 percent of full scale if:</P>
              <P>(i) The alternative in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is used to ensure that the accuracy of the calibration curve is maintained below 15 percent; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The full-scale value of the range is 155 ppm (C) or less; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The emissions from the engine are erratic and the integrated chart deflection value for the cycle is greater than 15 percent of full scale; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The contribution of all data read below the 15 percent level is less than 10 percent by mass of the final test results.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedure overview.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer or equivalent load and speed measurement device. The exhaust gases generated during engine operation are sampled either raw or dilute and specific components are analyzed through the analytical system.</P>
              <P>(b) The test is designed to determine the brake-specific emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen and fuel consumption. For Phase 2 Class I-B, Class I, and Class II natural gas fueled engines the test is also designed to determine the brake-specific emissions of non-methane hydrocarbons. The test consists of three different test cycles which are application specific for engines which span the typical operating range of nonroad spark-ignition engines. Two cycles exist for Class I-B, I and II engines and one is for Class I-A, III, IV, and V engines (see § 90.103(a) and § 90.116(b) for the definitions of Class I-A, I-B, and I—V engines). The test cycles for Class I-B, I, and II engines consist of one idle mode and five power modes at one speed (rated or intermediate). The test cycle for Class I-A, III, IV, and V engines consists of one idle mode at idle speed and one power mode at rated speed. These procedures require the determination of the concentration of each pollutant, fuel flow, and the power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and used to calculate the grams of each pollutant emitted per brake kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr).</P>
              <P>(c)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions the complete engine must be tested, with all emission control devices installed and functioning.</P>
              <P>(2) On air cooled engines, the cooling fan must be installed. For engines whose cooling fan serves a dual purpose, such as an air pump/blower, an external fan may be used to provide the engine with cooling air and the original cooling fan may be removed.</P>
              <P>(d) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the application must be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. In case of component malfunction or failure, no maintenance is allowed without prior approval from the Administrator, in accordance with § 90.119.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Engine service accumulation and stabilization procedure.</E> Use the service accumulation procedure determined by the manufacturer for exhaust emission stabilizing of an engine, consistent with good engineering practice (see § 90.118).</P>

              <P>(1) The manufacturer determines, for each engine family, the number of hours at which the engine exhaust emission control system combination is stabilized for emission testing. However, this stabilization procedure may not exceed 12 hours. The manufacturer must maintain, and provide to the Administrator upon request, a record of the rationale used in making this determination. If the manufacturer can document that at some time prior to the full 12 hour service accumulation <PRTPAGE P="235"/>period the engine emissions are decreasing for the remainder of the 12 hours, the service accumulation may be completed at that time. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 12 hours on each test engine within an engine family without making this determination.</P>
              <P>(2) During service accumulation, the fuel and lubricants specified in § 90.308 must be used.</P>
              <P>(3) Engine maintenance during service accumulation is allowed only in accordance with § 90.118.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Engine pre-test preparation.</E> (1) Drain and charge the fuel tank(s) with the specified test fuel (see § 90.308(b)) to 50 percent of the tank's nominal capacity. If an external fuel tank is used, the engine fuel inlet system pressure must be typical of what the engine will see in use.</P>
              <P>(2) An evaluation of the effects of test measurement systems on engine emissions shall be conducted using good engineering judgment to ensure that such test systems do not significantly impact exhaust emissions from the engine. For example, this would require evaluation of all types of emission sampling systems, and of fuel- and air-flow measurement systems for raw sampling. This can be accomplished by operating the engine at the highest engine torque value that will be encountered on the test cycle before and after such test systems are installed to ensure that the impact on measured torque is less than 5 percent. This may also be accomplished by measuring air-to-fuel ratio using a zirconia universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor to ensure that the impact on measured air-to-fuel ratio is less than 5 percent at the highest engine torque value that will be encountered on the test cycle before and after such test systems are installed. The impact of air- and fuel-flow measurement systems may be evaluated based on an engineering analysis of the impact of the change in pressure induced on air-intake pressure and fuel supply pressure by these measurement systems. While this would typically be done before testing, it may also be done as a post-test verification.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Analyzer pre-test procedures.</E> (1) If necessary, warm up and stabilize the analyzer(s) before calibrations are performed.</P>
              <P>(2) Replace or clean the filter elements and then leak check the system as required by § 90.324(a). If necessary, allow the heated sample line, filters, and pumps to reach operating temperature.</P>
              <P>(3) Perform the following system checks:</P>

              <P>(i) If necessary, check the sample-line temperature. Heated FID sample line temperature must be maintained between 110 °C and 230 °C; a heated NO<E T="52">X</E> sample line temperature must be maintained between 60 °C and 230 °C.</P>
              <P>(ii) Check that the system response time has been accounted for prior to sample collection data recording.</P>
              <P>(iii) A HC hang-up check is permitted (see § 90.413(e)).</P>
              <P>(4) Check analyzer zero and span before and after each test at a minimum. Further, check analyzer zero and span any time a range change is made or at the maximum demonstrated time span for stability for each analyzer used.</P>
              <P>(d) Check system flow rates and pressures and reset, if necessary.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Engine dynamometer test run.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Engine and dynamometer start-up.</E> (1) Only adjustments in accordance with § 90.119 may be made to the test engine prior to starting a test.</P>
              <P>(2) If necessary, warm up the dynamometer as recommended by the dynamometer manufacturer or use good engineering practice.</P>

              <P>(3) For Phase 1 engines, at the manufacturer's option, the engine can be run with the throttle in a fixed position or by using the engine's governor (if the engine is manufactured with a governor). In either case, the engine speed and load must meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(12) of this section. For Phase 2 Class I, Phase 2 Class I-B, and Phase 2 Class II engines equipped with an engine speed governor, the governor must be used to control engine speed during all test cycle modes except for Mode 1 or Mode 6, and no external throttle control may <PRTPAGE P="236"/>be used that interferes with the function of the engine's governor; a controller may be used to adjust the governor setting for the desired engine speed in Modes 2-5 or Modes 7-10; and during Mode 1 or Mode 6 fixed throttle operation may be used to determine the 100 percent torque value.</P>
              <P>(b) Each test consists of the following steps.</P>
              <P>(1) Record the general test data as specified in § 90.405(b).</P>
              <P>(2) Precondition the engine in the following manner;</P>
              <P>(i) Operate the engine at a power greater than or equal to 50 percent maximum power at the appropriate speed (rated or intermediate) for 20 minutes;</P>
              <P>(ii) Option. If the engine has been operating on service accumulation for a minimum of 40 minutes, the service accumulation may be substituted for step (i).</P>
              <P>(3) Record all pre-test data specified in § 90.405(c).</P>
              <P>(4) Start the test cycle (see § 90.410) within five minutes of the completion of the steps required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Modes are to be performed in the numerical order specified for the appropriate test cycle (see “Mode Points” Table 2 in Appendix A of this subpart).</P>
              <P>(6) For Class I, I-B, and II engines, during the maximum torque mode calculate the torque corresponding to 75, 50, 25, and 10 percent of the maximum observed torque (see Table 2 in Appendix A to this subpart).</P>
              <P>(7) Once engine speed and load are set for a mode, run the engine for a sufficient period of time to achieve thermal stability. At the manufacturer's option, determine and document the appropriate criterion for thermal stability for each engine family. If the manufacture chooses not to make this determination, an acceptable alternative is to run the engine at each mode until the cylinder head temperature remains within a 10 °C bandwidth for three minutes. Cylinder head temperature may be measured at the base of the spark plug. After stability is achieved, emission measurements are initiated.</P>
              <P>(8) Record all modal data specified in § 90.405(d) for a minimum time period of the last two minutes of each mode. Longer averaging periods are acceptable, but the data averaged must be from a continuous time period. The duration of time during which this data is recorded is referred to as the “sampling period.” The data collected during the sampling period is used for modal emission calculations.</P>
              <P>(9) Continuously record the analyzer's response to the exhaust gas during each mode.</P>
              <P>(10) Modes may be repeated.</P>
              <P>(11) If a delay of more than one hour occurs between the end of one mode and the beginning of another mode, the test is void and must be restarted at paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(12) The engine speed and load must be maintained within the requirements of § 90.410 during the sampling period of each mode. If this requirement is not met, the mode is void and must be restarted.</P>
              <P>(13) If at any time during a mode the test equipment malfunctions or the specifications in § 90.410 can not be met, the test is void and must be aborted. Corrective action should be taken and the test restarted.</P>
              <P>(14) If at any time during an operating mode the engine stalls, restart the engine immediately and continue the test starting with the steps required by paragraph (b)(6) of this section. If the engine will not restart within five minutes the test is void. If maintenance is required on the engine, advance approval from the Administrator is required as specified in § 90.119. After corrective action is taken, the engine may be rescheduled for testing. Report the reason for the malfunction (if determined) and the corrective action taken.</P>
              <P>(15) Fuel flow and air flow during the idle condition may be determined just prior to or immediately following the dynamometer sequence, if longer times are required for accurate measurements. If the dilute sampling method (Constant Volume Sampling) is used, neither fuel flow nor air flow measurements are required.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exhaust gas measurements.</E> (1) Measure HC, CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> concentrations in the exhaust sample. Use the same units and modal calculations as for your other results to report a <PRTPAGE P="237"/>single weighted value for CO<E T="52">2</E>; round CO<E T="52">2</E> to the nearest 1 g/kW-hr.</P>
              <P>(2) Each analyzer range that may be used during a test mode must have the zero and span responses recorded prior to the start of the test. Only the range(s) used to measure the emissions during the test is required to have its zero and span recorded after the completion of the test. Depending on the stability of each individual analyzer, more frequent zero checks or spans between modes may be necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) It is permitted to change filter elements between modes.</P>
              <P>(4) A leak check is permitted between modes.</P>
              <P>(5) A hang-up check is permitted between modes (see § 90.413).</P>
              <P>(6) If, during the emission measurement portion of a mode, the value of the gauges downstream of the NDIR analyzer(s) G3 or G4 (see Figure 1 in Appendix B of this subpart), differs by more than ±0.5kPa from the pretest value, the test mode is void.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Automatic data collection equipment requirements.</E> The analyzer response may be read by automatic data collection (ADC) equipment such as computers, data loggers, and so forth. If ADC equipment is used, the following is required:</P>
              <P>(1) For dilute grab (“bag”) sample analysis, the analyzer response must be stable at greater than 99 percent of the final reading for the dilute exhaust sample. The ADC must store a single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized period. Alternatively, the ADC may store the individual instantaneous chart deflections collected over a 10-second stabilized period.</P>
              <P>(2) For continuous analysis systems, the ADC must store a single value representing the average integrated concentration over a measurement period. Alternatively, the ADC may store the individual instantaneous values collected during the measurement period.</P>
              <P>(3) The chart deflections or average integrated concentrations required in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be stored on long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage discs, punch cards, or they may be printed in a listing for storage. In either case a chart recorder is not required and records from a chart recorder, if they exist, need not be stored.</P>
              <P>(4) If ADC equipment is used to interpret analyzer values, the ADC equipment is subject to the calibration specifications of the analyzer as if the ADC equipment is part of analyzer system.</P>
              <P>(b) Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be stored as chart recorder records.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Grab sample analysis.</E> For dilute grab sample analysis perform the following procedure:</P>

              <P>(4) Good engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample bag analyzer readings below 15 percent of full scale should generally not be used.</P>

              <P>(5) A post-analysis zero and span calibration check of each range must be performed and the values recorded. The number of events that may occur between the pre- and post-checks is not specified. However, the difference between pre-analysis zero and span values (recorded in paragraph (c)(2) or <PRTPAGE P="239"/>(c)(3) of this section) versus those recorded for the post-analysis check may not exceed the zero drift limit or the span drift limit of two percent of full-scale chart deflection for any range used. Otherwise the analysis is void.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuous sample analysis.</E> For continuous sample analysis perform the following procedure:</P>
              <P>(1) Calibrate analyzers using the procedure described in § 90.326.</P>
              <P>(2) Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at negative gauge pressures when sampling and allow heated sample lines, filters, pumps, and so forth to stabilize at operating temperature.</P>
              <P>(3) Option: Determine the HC hang-up for the FID or HFID sampling system:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero the analyzer using zero gas introduced at the analyzer port.</P>
              <P>(ii) Flow zero gas through the overflow sampling system. Check the analyzer response.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the overflow zero response exceeds the analyzer zero response by two percent or more of the FID or HFID full-scale deflection, hang-up is indicated and corrective action must be taken (see paragraph (e) of this section).</P>
              <P>(iv) The complete system hang-up check specified in paragraph (e) of this section is recommended as a periodic check.</P>
              <P>(4) If necessary, recalibrate analyzer using the procedure specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Good engineering practice dictates that analyzers used for continuous analysis should be operated such that the measured concentration falls between 15 percent and 100 percent of full scale.</P>
              <P>(6) Record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.</P>
              <P>(7) Collect background HC, CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> in a sample bag (for dilute exhaust sampling only, see § 90.422).</P>
              <P>(8) Perform a post-analysis zero and span check for each range used at the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Record these responses as the post-analysis values.</P>

              <P>(9) Neither the zero drift nor the span drift between the pre-analysis and post-analysis checks on any range used may exceed three percent for HC, or two percent for NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>, of full-scale chart deflection, or the test is void. (If the HC drift is greater than three percent of full-scale chart deflection, HC hang-up is likely.)</P>
              <P>(10) Determine background levels of HC, NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, or CO<E T="52">2</E> (for dilute exhaust sampling only) by the grab (“bag”) technique outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>CVS concept of exhaust gas sampling system.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A dilute exhaust sampling system is designed to directly measure the true mass of emissions in engine exhaust without the necessity of measuring either fuel flow or intake air flow. This is accomplished by diluting the exhaust produced by a test engine with ambient background air and measuring the total diluted exhaust flow rate and the concentration of emissions within the dilute flow. Total mass flow of an emission is then easily calculated.</P>
              <P>(b) A constant volume sampler (CVS) is typically used to control the total amount of dilute flow through the system. As the name implies, a CVS restricts flow to a known value dependent only on the dilute exhaust temperature and pressure.</P>
              <P>(c) For the testing described in this subpart, a CVS must consist of: a mixing tunnel into which the engine exhaust and dilutant (background) air are dumped; a dilute exhaust flow metering system; a dilute exhaust sample port; a background sample port; a dilute exhaust sampling system; and a background sampling system.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Mixing tunnel.</E> The mixing tunnel must be constructed such that complete mixing of the engine exhaust and background air is assured prior to the sampling probe.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exhaust flow metering system.</E> A dilute exhaust flow metering system must be used to control the total flow rate of the dilute engine exhaust as described in § 90.421.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Exhaust sample port.</E> A dilute exhaust sample port must be located in or downstream of the mixing tunnel at a point where complete mixing of the engine exhaust and background air is assured.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Background sample port.</E> A dilute exhaust sample port must be located in the stream of background air before it is mixed with the engine exhaust. The background probe must draw a representative sample of the background air during each sampling mode.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Exhaust sampling system.</E> The dilute exhaust sampling system controls the flow of samples from the mixing tunnel to the analyzer system. This could be either a continuous sampling system or grab (bag) sampling system. If a critical flow venturi (CFV) is used on the dilute exhaust sample probe, this system must assure that the sample CFV is in choke flow during testing. If no CFV is used, this system must assure a constant volumetric flow rate through the dilute exhaust sample probe or must incorporate electronic flow compensation.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Background sampling system.</E> The background sampling system controls the flow of samples from the background air supply to the analyzer system. This could be either a continuous sampling system or grab (bag) sampling system. This system must assure a constant volumetric flow rate through the background sample probe.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Dilute gaseous exhaust sampling and analytical system description.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The exhaust gas sampling system described in this section is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in the exhaust of nonroad small spark-ignition engines. This system utilizes the Constant Volume Sampling (CVS) concept (described in § 90.420) of measuring mass emissions of HC, NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>. Grab sampling for individual modes is an acceptable method of dilute testing for all constituents, HC, NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>. Continuous dilute sampling is not required for any of the exhaust constituents, but is allowable for all. Heated sampling is not required for any of the constituents, but is allowable for HC and NO<E T="52">X</E>. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement of CO<E T="52">2</E>. General requirements are as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) This sampling system requires the use of a Positive Displacement Pump—Constant Volume Sampler (PDP-CVS) system with a heat exchanger, or a Critical Flow Venturi—Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-CVS) system with CFV sample probes and/or a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation. Figure 2 in Appendix B of this subpart is a schematic drawing of the PDP-CVS system. Figure 3 in Appendix <PRTPAGE P="245"/>B of this subpart is a schematic drawing of the CFV-CVS system.</P>
              <P>(2) The HC analytical system requires:</P>
              <P>(i) Grab sampling (see § 90.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in Appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see § 90.423, and Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart), or</P>
              <P>(ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted HC meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) The dilute HC analytical system for nonroad small spark-ignition engines does not require a heated flame ionization detector (HFID).</P>
              <P>(iv) If used, the HFID sample must be taken directly from the diluted exhaust stream through a heated probe and integrated continuously over the test cycle.</P>
              <P>(v) The heated probe must be located in the sampling system far enough downstream of the mixing area to ensure a uniform sample distribution across the CVS duct at the sampling zone.</P>
              <P>(3) The CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> analytical system requires:</P>
              <P>(i) Grab sampling (see § 90.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in Appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see § 90.423, and Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart), or</P>

              <P>(ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The NO<E T="52">X</E> analytical system requires:</P>
              <P>(i) Grab sampling (see § 90.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in Appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see § 90.423, and Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart), or</P>

              <P>(ii) A continuously integrated measurement of diluted NO<E T="52">X</E> meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. Other components, such as snubbers, which are not needed to maintain accuracy on some systems, may be excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(6) Other sampling and/or analytical systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Component description.</E> The components necessary for exhaust sampling must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exhaust dilution system.</E> The PDP-CVS must conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas PDP-CVS in § 90.420 of this chapter. The CFV-CVS must conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas CFV-CVS in § 90.420 of this chapter. In addition, the CVS must conform to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream in the dilution system at a temperature of 190 °C or less at the sampling zone for hydrocarbon measurement and as required to prevent condensation at any point in the dilution system. Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from this sampling point.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the CFV-CVS, either a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation is required (see Figure 3 in Appendix B of this subpart).</P>
              <P>(iii) For the CFV-CVS when a heat exchanger is used, the gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately ahead of the critical flow venturi, must be within ±11 °C of the average operating temperature observed during the test with the simultaneous requirement that condensation does not occur. The temperature measuring system (sensors and readout) must have an accuracy and precision of ±2 °C. For systems utilizing a flow compensator to maintain proportional flow, the requirement for maintaining constant temperature is not necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Continuous HC measurement system.</E> (i) The continuous HC sample system (as shown in Figure 2 or 3 in Appendix B of this subpart) uses an “overflow” zero and span system. In this type of system, excess zero or span gas spills <PRTPAGE P="246"/>out of the probe when zero and span checks of the analyzer are made.</P>
              <P>(ii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC sample probe, line, or system, unless a common sample pump is used for all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good engineering practice.</P>
              <P>(iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line must be at least 105 percent of the sample system flow rate.</P>
              <P>(iv) The overflow gases must enter the sample line as close as practical to the outside surface of the CVS duct or dilution system.</P>
              <P>(v) The continuous HC sampling system consists of a probe (which for a HFID analyzer must raise the sample to the specified temperature) and, where used, a sample transfer system (which for a HFID must maintain the specified temperature). The HFID continuous hydrocarbon sampling system (exclusive of the probe) must:</P>
              <P>(A) Maintain a wall temperature of 190 ±11 °C as measured at every separately controlled heated component (that is, filters, heated line sections), using permanent thermocouples located at each of the separate components.</P>
              <P>(B) Have a wall temperature of 190 ±11 °C over its entire length. The temperature of the system is demonstrated by profiling the thermal characteristics of the system where possible at initial installation and after any major maintenance performed on the system. The profiling is to be accomplished using the insertion thermocouple probing technique. The system temperature must be monitored continuously during testing at the locations and temperature described in § 90.421(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(C) Maintain a gas temperature of 190 ±11 °C immediately before the heated filter and HFID. Determine these gas temperatures by a temperature sensor located immediately upstream of each component.</P>
              <P>(vi) The continuous hydrocarbon sampling probe:</P>
              <P>(A) Is defined as the first 25.4 to 76.2 cm of the continuous hydrocarbon sampling system.</P>
              <P>(B) Has a 0.483 cm minimum inside diameter.</P>
              <P>(C) Is installed in the dilution system at a point where the dilution air and exhaust are well mixed and provide a homogenous mixture.</P>
              <P>(D) Is sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the system wall so as to be free from the influence of any wakes or eddies.</P>
              <P>(E) For a continuous HFID sample probe, the probe must increases the gas stream temperature to 190 ±11 °C at the exit of the probe. Demonstrate the ability of the probe to accomplish this using the insertion thermocouple technique at initial installation and after any major maintenance. Demonstrate compliance with the temperature specification by continuously recording during each test the temperature of either the gas stream or the wall of the sample probe at its terminus.</P>
              <P>(vii) The response time of the continuous measurement system must be taken into account when logging test data.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Sample mixing.</E> (i) Configure the dilution system to ensure a well mixed, homogeneous sample prior to the sampling probe(s).</P>
              <P>(ii) Make the temperature of the diluted exhaust stream inside the dilution system sufficient to prevent water condensation.</P>
              <P>(iii) Direct the engine exhaust downstream at the point where it is introduced into the dilution system.</P>

CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E> must be heated and insulated over the entire length, to prevent water condensation, to a minimum temperature of 55 °C.

              <P>(a) Background samples are produced by drawing a sample of the dilution air during the exhaust collection phase of each test cycle mode.</P>
              <P>(1) An individual background sample may be produced and analyzed for each mode. Hence, a unique background value will be used for the emission calculations for each mode.</P>
              <P>(2) Alternatively, a single background sample may be produced by drawing a sample during the collection phase of each test cycle mode. Hence, a single cumulative background value will be used for the emission calculations for each mode.</P>
              <P>(b) For analysis of the individual sample described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized period must be stored. All readings taken during the data logging period must be stable within ±one percent of full scale.</P>
              <P>(c) Measure HC, CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> exhaust and background concentrations in the sample bag(s) with approximately the same flow rates and pressures used during calibration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exhaust gas analytical system; CVS grab sample.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Schematic drawings.</E> Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart is a schematic drawing of the exhaust gas analytical systems used for analyzing CVS grab “bag” samples from spark-ignition engines. Since various configurations can produce accurate results, exact conformance with the drawing is not required. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and switches may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. Other components such as snubbers, which are not needed to maintain accuracy in some systems, may be excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Major component description.</E> The analytical system, Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart, consists of a flame ionization detector (FID) or a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) for the measurement of hydrocarbons, non-dispersive infrared analyzers (NDIR) for the measurement of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and a chemiluminescence detector (CLD) (or heated CLD (HCLD)) for the measurement of oxides of nitrogen. The exhaust gas analytical system must conform to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The CLD (or HCLD) requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in the sample be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of analyzers may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) If CO instruments are used which are essentially free of CO<E T="52">2</E> and water vapor interference, the use of the conditioning column may be deleted. (See § 90.317 and § 90.320.)</P>

              <P>(3) A CO instrument is considered to be essentially free of CO<E T="52">2</E> and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture of three percent CO<E T="52">2</E> in N<E T="52">2</E>, which has been bubbled through water at room temperature, produces an equivalent CO response, as measured on the most sensitive CO range, which is less than one percent of full-scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or less than three ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale. (See § 90.317.)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternate analytical systems.</E> Analysis systems meeting the specifications <PRTPAGE P="248"/>and requirements of this subpart for dilute sampling may be used upon approval of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Other analyzers and equipment.</E> Other types of analyzers and equipment may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Dilute sampling procedures—CVS calibration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor valve.</P>
              <P>(1) The flowmeter calibration must be traceable to the National Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST) and serves as the reference value (NIST “true” value) for the CVS calibration. (Note: In no case should an upstream screen or other restriction which can affect the flow be used ahead of the flowmeter unless calibrated throughout the flow range with such a device.)</P>
              <P>(2) The CVS calibration procedures are designed for use of a “metering venturi” type flowmeter. Large radius or American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) flow nozzles are considered equivalent if traceable to NIST measurements. Other measurement systems may be used if shown to be equivalent under the test conditions in this section and traceable to NIST measurements.</P>
              <P>(3) Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are recorded and related to flow through the CVS.</P>
              <P>(4) Procedures using both PDP-CVS and CFV-CVS are outlined in the following paragraphs. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of the entire system may be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of the system (for example, analyzer calibration, leaks, or HC hangup). A verification procedure is found in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PDP-CVS calibration.</E> (1) The following calibration procedure outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the CVS pump.</P>
              <P>(i) All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump.</P>
              <P>(ii) The calculated flow rate, in cm<SU>3</SU>/s, (at pump inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of pump parameters.</P>
              <P>(iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is then determined.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range used must be performed.</P>
              <P>(2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Two conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve:</P>
              <P>(i) The temperature stability must be maintained during calibration. (Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations; this can cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes in temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes.)</P>
              <P>(ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of leakage.</P>
              <P>(3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the calibration equation.</P>

              <P>(4) Connect a system as shown in Figure 5 in Appendix B of this subpart. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the system indicated, the following measurements and accuracies are required:<PRTPAGE P="249"/>

              <P>(a) The purpose of the evaluation procedure specified in this section is to determine the effect of thermal stress on catalyst conversion efficiency for Phase 1 engines. The thermal stress is imposed on the test catalyst by exposing it to quiescent heated air in an oven. The evaluation of the effect of such stress on catalyst performance is based on the resultant degradation of the efficiency with which the conversions of specific pollutants are promoted. The application of this evaluation procedure involves the several steps that are described in the following paragraphs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of initial conversion efficiency.</E> (1) A synthetic exhaust gas mixture having the composition specified in § 90.329 is heated to a temperature of 450 °C ±5 °C and passed through the new test catalyst or, optionally, a test catalyst that has been exposed to temperatures less than or equal to 500 °C for less than or equal to two hours, under flow conditions that are representative of anticipated in-use conditions.</P>
              <P>(2) The concentration of each pollutant of interest, that is, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, or oxides of nitrogen, in the effluent of the catalyst is determined by means of the instrumentation that is specified for exhaust gas analysis in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) The conversion efficiency for each pollutant is determined by:</P>
              <P>(i) Subtracting the effluent concentration from the initial concentration;</P>
              <P>(ii) Dividing this result by the initial concentration; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Multiplying this result by 100 percent.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Imposition of thermal stress.</E> (1) The catalyst is placed in an oven that has been pre-heated to 1000 °C and the temperature of the air in the oven is maintained at 1000 °C ±10 °C for six hours.</P>
              <P>(2) The catalyst is removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of final conversion efficiency.</E> The steps listed in paragraph (b) of this section are repeated.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination of conversion efficiency degradation.</E> (1) The final conversion efficiency determined in paragraph (c) of this section is subtracted from the initial conversion efficiency determined in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) This result is divided by the initial conversion efficiency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test orders.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Administrator shall require any testing under this subpart by means of a test order addressed to the manufacturer.</P>

              <P>(b) The test order will be signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or his or her designee. The test order will be delivered in person by an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative to a company representative or sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the manufacturer's representative <PRTPAGE P="262"/>who signed the application for certification submitted by the manufacturer, pursuant to the requirements of the applicable section of subpart B of this part. Upon receipt of a test order, the manufacturer shall comply with all of the provisions of this subpart and instructions in the test order.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Information included in test order.</E> (1) The test order will specify the engine family to be selected for testing, the manufacturer's engine assembly plant or associated storage facility or port facility (for imported engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time and location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure by which engines of the specified family must be selected. The test order may specify the configuration to be audited and/or the number of engines to be selected per day. Engine manufacturers will be required to select a minimum of four engines per day unless an alternate selection procedure is approved pursuant to § 90.507(a), or unless total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day, the manufacturer will select the actual number of engines produced per day.</P>
              <P>(2) The test order may include alternate families to be selected for testing at the Administrator's discretion in the event that engines of the specified family are not available for testing because those engines are not being manufactured during the specified time, or are not being stored at the specified assembly plant, associated storage facilities or port of entry.</P>
              <P>(3) If the specified family is not being manufactured at a rate of at least two engines per day in the case of manufacturers specified in § 90.508(g)(1), or one engine per day in the case of manufacturers specified in § 90.508(g)(2), over the expected duration of the audit, the Assistant Administrator or his or her designated representative may select engines of the alternate family for testing.</P>
              <P>(4) In addition, the test order may include other directions or information essential to the administration of the required testing.</P>
              <P>(d) A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families and the corresponding assembly plants, associated storage facilities, or (in the case of imported engines) port facilities from which the manufacturer prefers to have engines selected for testing in response to a test order. In order that a manufacturer's preferred location be considered for inclusion in a test order for a particular engine family, the list must be submitted prior to issuance of the test order. Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the list, the Administrator may order selection at other than a preferred location.</P>
              <P>(e) Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) During a given model year, the Administrator shall not issue to a manufacturer more Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) test orders than an annual limit determined by the following:</P>
              <P>(i) for manufacturers with a projected annual production of less than 100,000 engines bound for the United States market for that model year, the number is two;</P>
              <P>(ii) for manufacturers with a projected annual production of 100,000 or more engines bound for the United States market for that model year, by dividing the manufacturer's total number of certified engine families by five and rounding to the nearest whole number, unless the number of engine families is less than eight, in which case the number is two.</P>
              <P>(2) If a manufacturer submits to EPA in writing prior to or during the model year a reliable sales projection update or adds engine families or deletes engine families from its production, that information will be used for recalculating the manufacturer's annual limit of SEA test orders.</P>
              <P>(3) Any SEA test order for which the family or configuration, as appropriate, fails under § 90.510 or for which testing is not completed will not be counted against the annual limit.</P>

              <P>(4) When the annual limit has been met, the Administrator may issue additional test orders to test those families or configurations for which evidence <PRTPAGE P="263"/>exists indicating nonconformity, or for which the Administrator has reason to believe are not being appropriately represented or tested in Production Line Testing conducted under subpart H of this part, if applicable. An SEA test order issued pursuant to this provision will include a statement as to the reason for its issuance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sample selection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at the location and in the manner specified in the test order. If a manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be selected in the manner specified in the test order, an alternative selection procedure may be employed, provided the manufacturer requests approval of the alternative procedure prior to the start of test sample selection, and the Administrator approves the procedure.</P>

              <P>(b) The manufacturer shall assemble the test engines of the family selected for testing using its normal mass production process for engines to be distributed into commerce. If, between <PRTPAGE P="266"/>the time the manufacturer is notified of a test order and the time the manufacturer finishes selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any change(s) in its production processes, including quality control, which may reasonably be expected to affect the emissions of the engines selected, then the manufacturer shall, during the audit, inform the Administrator of such changes. If the test engines are selected at a location where they do not have their operational and emission control systems installed, the test order will specify the manner and location for selection of components to complete assembly of the engines. The manufacturer shall assemble these components onto the test engines using normal assembly and quality control procedures as documented by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used on the test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the production and assembly of all other engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the modification in assembly procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement officer(s) or authorized representative(s), rather than the manufacturer, select the test engines according to the method specified in the test order.</P>
              <P>(e) The order in which test engines are selected determines the order in which test results are to be used in applying the sampling plan in accordance with § 90.510.</P>
              <P>(f) The manufacturer shall keep on hand all untested engines, if any, comprising the test sample until a pass or fail decision is reached in accordance with § 90.510(e). The manufacturer may ship any tested engine which has not failed in accordance with § 90.510(b). However, once the manufacturer ships any test engine, it relinquishes the prerogative to conduct retests as provided in § 90.508(i).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For nonroad engines subject to the provisions of this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are the appropriate small SI engine test procedures as described in subpart E of this part.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify the engines selected for testing and shall not perform any emission tests on engines selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are documented in the manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing in accordance with § 90.112(c), to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with § 90.112(a), prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to any setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 12 hours of service on the engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use engines.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Service Accumulation.</E> Prior to performing exhaust emission testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer <PRTPAGE P="267"/>may accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service equal to the greater of 12 hours or the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission data engine corresponding to the family specified in the test order.</P>
              <P>(1) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of normal production engines. This service accumulation must be consistent with the new engine break-in instructions contained in the applicable owner's manual.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer shall accumulate service at a minimum rate of 12 hours per engine during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(i) The first 24 hour period for service shall begin as soon as authorized checks, inspections, and preparations are completed on each engine.</P>
              <P>(ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate does not apply on weekends or holidays.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the manufacturer's service or target is less than the minimum rate specified (12 hours per day), then the minimum daily accumulation rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's service target.</P>
              <P>(3) Service accumulation shall be completed on a sufficient number of test engines during consecutive 24-hour periods to assure that the number of engines tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test engines after selection for testing, nor shall the Administrator allow deletion of any engine from the test sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator before any engine maintenance or deletion.</P>
              <P>(e) The manufacturer shall expeditiously ship test engines from the point of selection to the test facility. If the test facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point of selection, the manufacturer shall assure that test engines arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection, except that the Administrator may approve more time for shipment based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</P>
              <P>(f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence.</P>
              <P>(g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer shall notify the Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order as to which test facility will be used to comply with the test order. If no test cells are available at a desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(1) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the United States market for the applicable year of 7,500 or greater shall complete emission testing at a minimum rate of two engines per 24-hour period, including each voided test.</P>
              <P>(2) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the United States market for the applicable year of less than 7,500 shall complete emission testing at a minimum rate of one engine per 24-hour period, including each voided test.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator may approve a lower daily rate of emission testing based upon a request by a manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</P>
              <P>(h) The manufacturer shall perform test engine selection, shipping, preparation, service accumulation, and testing in such a manner as to assure that the audit is performed in an expeditious manner.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Retesting.</E> (1) The manufacturer may retest any engines tested during a Selective Enforcement Audit once a fail decision for the audit has been reached in accordance with § 90.510(e).</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may approve retesting at other times based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</P>

              <P>(3) The manufacturer may retest each engine a total of three times. The manufacturer shall test each engine or vehicle the same number of times. The <PRTPAGE P="268"/>manufacturer may accumulate additional service before conducting a retest, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(j) A manufacturer may test engines with the test procedure specified in subpart E of this part to demonstrate compliance with the exhaust emission standards; however, if alternate procedures were used in certification pursuant to § 90.120, then those alternate procedures shall be used.</P>

              <P>(a) Initial test results are calculated following the applicable test procedure specified in paragraph (a) of § 90.508. The manufacturer shall round these results, in accordance with ASTM E29-93a, to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional significant figure. ASTM E29-93a has been incorporated by reference. See § 90.7.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section for each test engine, dividing by the number of tests conducted on the engine, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard. For Phase 2 engines only, this result shall be expressed to one additional significant figure.</P>
              <P>(2) Final deteriorated test results (for Phase 2 test engines only) are calculated by applying the appropriate deterioration factors, from the certification process for the engine family, to the final test results, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(c) Within five working days after completion of testing of all engines pursuant to a test order, the manufacturer shall submit to the Administrator a report which includes the following information:</P>

              <P>(d) The pass and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of engines tested are determined by using the tables in Appendix A to this subpart, “Sampling Plans for Selective Enforcement Auditing of Small Nonroad Engines,” appropriate to the projected sales as made by the manufacturer in its report to EPA under § 90.505(c)(1). In the tables in Appendix A to this subpart, sampling plan “stage” refers to the cumulative number of engines tested. Once a pass or fail decision has been made for a particular pollutant, the number of engines with final test results exceeding the emission standard for that pollutant shall not be considered any further for the purposes of the audit.</P>
              <P>(e) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision is made on the last engine test required to make a decision under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 90.511</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any engine failing pursuant to § 90.510(b) effective from the time that testing of that engine is completed.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for a family which does not pass an SEA, pursuant to paragraph § 90.510(c), based on the first test or all tests conducted on each engine. This suspension will not occur before ten days after failure of the audit.</P>
              <P>(c) If the results of testing pursuant to these regulations indicate that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the application may be covered by a certificate of conformity, the Administrator may suspend such certificate in whole or in part if the Administrator finds any one of the following infractions to be substantial:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with the provisions of a test order issued by the Administrator under § 90.503.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(3) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="270"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) An EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative is denied the opportunity to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in this subpart and a warrant or court order is presented to the manufacturer or the party in charge of a facility in question.</P>
              <P>(6) An EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative is unable to conduct activities related to entry and access as authorized in § 90.506 because a manufacturer has located a facility in a foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits those activities.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in part, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for a family when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as reported by the manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as described in the application for certification of the affected family.</P>
              <P>(g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer shall take the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine;</P>
              <P>(i) Remedy the nonconformity; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Demonstrate that the engine conforms to applicable standards by retesting the engine in accordance with these regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other information that may be required by this regulation.</P>
              <P>(h) Once a certificate for a failed family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer shall take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate:</P>
              <P>(1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies will be implemented.</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family, at the plant(s), port facility(ies) or associated storage facility(ies) specified by the Administrator, in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for an engine actually determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Once the certificate has been revoked for a family and the manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions shall be taken before the Administrator may consider issuing a certificate for that modified family:</P>

              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (f) of this section, whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to evaluate the proposed change or changes or whether additional testing will be required; and<PRTPAGE P="271"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer shall demonstrate that the modified engine family does in fact conform with these regulations by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that modified engine family in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order. If the subsequent audit results in passing of the audit, the Administrator shall reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family, provided that the manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this subpart are limited to the family affected by the test order.</P>
              <P>(j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than 15 days or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.</P>
              <P>(k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph (d) of this section shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with §§ 90.512, 90.513, and 90.514 and</P>
              <P>(2) Not apply to engines no longer in the possession of the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section and prior to the commencement of a hearing under § 90.512, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.</P>
              <P>(m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines when conducting an audit of a family subsequent to a failure of an SEA and while reauditing the failed family it may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the condition that the manufacturer commits to recall all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the family fails the subsequent audit at the level of the standard and to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request for public hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision to suspend, revoke or void a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to § 90.511(a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer's request shall be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of his or her decision to suspend, revoke or void, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer shall simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Director of the Engine Programs and Compliance Division and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his or her discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the suspension, revocation or voiding.</P>
              <P>(c) A manufacturer shall include in the request for a public hearing:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement as to which engine configuration(s) within a family is to be the subject of the hearing;</P>

              <P>(2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing requested under § 90.511(j), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:<PRTPAGE P="272"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Whether tests have been properly conducted (specifically, whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning);</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether sampling plans have been properly applied (specifically, whether sampling procedures specified in Appendix A of this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines produced at plants other than the one from which engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's decision under § 90.511(c));</P>
              <P>(3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and</P>
              <P>(4) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's position on each of the issues raised.</P>
              <P>(d) A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available to the public during Agency business hours.</P>

              <P>(a) Except where otherwise indicated, this subpart is applicable to engines and vehicles which are offered for importation or imported into the United States and for which the Administrator has promulgated regulations under subpart B of this part prescribing emission standards, but which are not covered by certificates of conformity issued under section 213 and section 206(a) of the Clean Air Act (that is, which are nonconforming engines as defined below) and under subpart B of this part at the time of importation or conditional importation, as applicable. Compliance with regulations under this subpart shall not relieve any person or entity from compliance with other applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Regulations prescribing further procedures for the importation of small SI engines into the Customs territory of the United States, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1202, are set forth in U.S. Customs Service regulations.</P>

              <P>(c) Importers must complete the appropirate EPA declaration form before importing an engine. These forms are available on the Internet at <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/OTAQ/imports/</E> or by phone at 734-214-4100. Importers must keep the forms for five years and make them available promptly upon request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions and exclusions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Individuals shall be eligible for importing engines into the United States under the provisions of this section, unless otherwise specified.</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, an engine entitled to one of the temporary exemptions of this paragraph may be conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written approval for the conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission is to be under U.S. Customs Service bond. The Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request for approval from the Administrator is to contain the identification required in § 90.604(c) and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption. Noncompliance with provisions of this section may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond or exportation of the engine.

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exemption for repairs or alterations.</E> A person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming engine solely for purpose of repairs or alterations. The engine may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of repair or alteration or shipment to the point of repair or alteration and to the port of export. It may not be sold or leased in the United States and is to be exported upon completion of the repairs or alterations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Testing exemption.</E> A test engine may be conditionally imported by a person subject to the requirements of § 90.905. A test engine may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not exceeding one year from the <PRTPAGE P="277"/>date of importation unless a request is made by the appropriate importer concerning the engine in accordance with § 90.905(f) for a subsequent one-year period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Display exemptions.</E> (i) An engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported subject to the requirements of § 90.907.</P>
              <P>(ii) A display engine may be imported by any person for purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, display of an engine at a dealership, private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for display exemptions. A display engine may not be sold in the United States and may not be operated in the United States except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</P>
              <P>(iii) A temporary display exemption will be granted for 12 months (one year) or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Two extensions of up to 12 months (one year) each are available upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption exceed 36 months (three years).</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, an engine may be finally admitted into the United States under this paragraph if prior written approval for such final admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission of these engines under this subpart is not permitted for the purpose of obtaining such written approval from the Administrator. A request for approval is to contain the identification information required in § 90.604(c) and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption or exclusion. The following exemptions or exclusions are permitted by this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">National security exemption.</E> An engine may be imported under the national security exemption found at § 90.908.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Hardship exemption.</E> The Administrator may exempt on a case-by-case basis an engine from federal emission requirements to accommodate unforeseen cases of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances.</P>

              <P>(A) is owned by the importer;</P>
              <P>(B) is not offered for importation for the purpose of resale; and</P>
              <P>(C) is proven to be identical, in all material respects, to an engine certified by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for sale in the United States or is proven to have been modified to be identical, in all material respects, to an engine certified by the OEM for sale in the United States according to complete written instructions provided by the OEM's United States representative, or his/her designee.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Proof of Conformity.</E> (A) Documentation submitted pursuant to this section for the purpose of proving conformity of individual engines is to contain sufficiently organized data or evidence demonstrating that the engine identified pursuant to § 90.604(c) is identical, in all material respects, to an engine identified in an OEM's application for certification.</P>
              <P>(B) If the documentation does not contain all the information required by this part, or is not sufficiently organized, EPA will notify the importer of any areas of inadequacy, and that the documentation will not receive further consideration until the required information or organization is provided.</P>
              <P>(C) If EPA determines that the documentation does not clearly or sufficiently demonstrate that an engine is eligible for importation, EPA will notify the importer in writing.</P>
              <P>(D) If EPA determines that the documentation clearly and sufficiently demonstrates that an engine is eligible for importation, EPA will grant approval for importation and notify the importer in writing.</P>

              <P>(d) Foreign diplomatic and military personnel may import a nonconforming engine without bond. At the time of admission, the importer shall submit to the Administrator the written report required in § 90.604(a) and a statement <PRTPAGE P="278"/>from the U.S. Department of State confirming qualification for this exemption. Foreign military personnel may, in lieu of a statement from the U.S. Department of State, submit to the Administrator a copy of their orders for duty in the United States. The engine may not be sold in the United States and must be exported if the individual's diplomatic status is no longer applicable, as determined by the Department of State, or the foreign military orders for duty in the United States are no longer applicable, unless subsequently brought into conformity with U.S. emission requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Competition exclusion.</E> A nonconforming engine may be conditionally admitted by any person provided the importer demonstrates to the Administrator that the engine is used to propel a nonroad vehicle used solely for competition and obtains prior written approval from the Administrator. A nonconforming engine imported pursuant to this paragraph may not be operated in the United States except for that operation incident and necessary for the competition purpose, unless subsequently brought into conformity with United States emission requirements in accordance with § 90.612(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exclusions/exemptions based on date of original manufacture.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subpart, engines originally manufactured prior to model year 1997 are excluded from the requirements of the Act in accordance with section 213 of the Act and may be imported by any person.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, an engine not subject to an exclusion under § 90.612(f)(1) but greater than 20 original production (OP) years old is entitled to an exemption from the requirements of the Act, provided that it has not been modified in those 20 OP years. At the time of admission, the importer shall submit to the Administrator the written report required in § 90.604(c).</P>

              <P>(a) At the start of each model year, the small SI engine manufacturer will begin to randomly select engines from each engine family for production line testing at a rate of one percent of the projected production of that family. Each engine will be selected from the end of the assembly line.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">For newly certified engine families:</E> After two engines are tested, the manufacturer will calculate the required sample size for the model year for each pollutant (HC + NO<E T="52">X</E>(NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>) and CO) according to the Sample Size Equation in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">For carry-over engine families:</E> After one engine is tested, the manufacturer will combine the test with the last test result from the previous model year and then calculate the required sample size for the model year for each pollutant according to the Sample Size Equation in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Manufacturers will calculate the required sample size for the model year for each pollutant for each engine family using the Sample Size Equation in this paragraph. N is calculated for each pollutant from each test result. The higher of the two values for the number N indicates the number of tests required for the model year for an engine family. N is recalculated for each pollutant after each test. Test results used to calculate the variables in the following Sample Size Equation must be final deteriorated test results as specified in § 90.709(c).</P>

              <P>(3) A manufacturer must distribute the testing of the remaining number of engines needed to meet the required sample size N, evenly throughout the remainder of the model year.</P>
              <P>(4) After each new test, the required sample size, N, is recalculated using updated sample means, sample standard deviations and the appropriate 95% confidence coefficient.</P>
              <P>(5) A manufacturer must continue testing and updating each engine family's sample size calculations according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section until a decision is made to stop testing as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section or a noncompliance decision is made pursuant to § 90.710(b).</P>

              <P>(6) If, at any time throughout the model year, the calculated required <PRTPAGE P="283"/>sample size, N, for an engine family is less than or equal to the actual sample size, n, and the sample mean, x, for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> (NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>) and CO is less than or equal to the FEL or standard if no FEL, the manufacturer may stop testing that engine family.</P>

              <P>(7) If, at any time throughout the model year, the sample mean, x, for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> (NMHC + NO<E T="52">X</E>) or CO is greater than the FEL or standard if no FEL, the manufacturer must continue testing that engine family at the appropriate maximum sampling rate.</P>
              <P>(8) The maximum required sample size for an engine family (regardless of the required sample size, N, as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is the lesser of thirty tests per model year or one percent of projected annual production for that engine family for that model year.</P>
              <P>(9) Manufacturers may elect to test additional engines. Additional engines, whether tested in accordance with the testing procedures specified in § 90.707 or not, may not be included in the Sample Size and Cumulative Sum equation calculations as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and § 90.708(a), respectively. However, such additional test results may be used as appropriate to “bracket” or define the boundaries of the production duration of any emission nonconformity determined under this subpart. Such additional test data must be identified and provided to EPA with the submittal of the official CumSum results.</P>
              <P>(c) The manufacturer must produce and assemble the test engines using its normal production and assembly process for engines to be distributed into commerce.</P>
              <P>(d) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures shall be used on any test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the production and assembly of all other engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the modification in production or assembly procedures in advance.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) For small SI engines subject to the provisions of this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are specified in subpart E of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other than those specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any small SI engine the Administrator determines is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify any test engine and may not perform any emission test on any test engine unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification and/or test is documented in the manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and is actually performed by the manufacturer on every production line engine or unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification and/or test is required or permitted under this subpart or is approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification, Production Line Testing and Selective Enforcement Audit testing, to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator, prior to the performance of any test. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator may not adjust it or require that it be adjusted to any setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 12 hours of service on the engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply information necessary to establish an alternate minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these adjustments, may consider the <PRTPAGE P="284"/>effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance characteristics and information from similar in-use engines.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Service accumulation.</E> (1) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, prior to performing exhaust emission production line testing, the manufacturer may accumulate up to 12 hours of service on each test engine. For catalyst-equipped engines, the manufacturer must accumulate a number of hours equal to the number of hours accumulated to represent stabilized emissions on the engine used to obtain certification.</P>
              <P>(2) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of production line engines.</P>
              <P>(d) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on test engines after selection for testing.</P>
              <P>(e) If an engine is shipped to a remote facility for production line testing, and an adjustment or repair is necessary because of shipment, the engine manufacturer must perform the necessary adjustment or repair only after the initial test of the engine, except in cases where the Administrator has determined that the test would be impossible or unsafe to perform or would permanently damage the engine. Engine manufacturers must report to the Administrator, in the quarterly report required by § 90.709(e), all adjustments or repairs performed on test engines prior to each test.</P>
              <P>(f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Testing.</E> A manufacturer must test engines with the test procedure specified in subpart E of this part to demonstrate compliance with the applicable FEL (or standard where there is no FEL). If alternate or special test procedures pursuant to regulations at § 90.120 are used in certification, then those alternate procedures must be used in production line testing.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Retesting.</E> (1) If an engine manufacturer reasonably determines that an emission test of an engine is invalid because of a procedural error, test equipment problem, or engine performance problem that causes the engine to be unable to safely perform a valid test, the engine may be retested. A test is not invalid simply because the emission results are high relative to other engines of the family. Emission results from all tests must be reported to EPA. The engine manufacturer must also include a detailed explanation of the reasons for invalidating any test in the quarterly report required in § 90.709(e). If a test is invalidated because of an engine performance problem, the manufacturer must document in detail the nature of the problem and the repairs performed in order to use the after-repair test results for the original test results.</P>
              <P>(2) Routine retests may be conducted if the manufacturer conducts the same number of tests on all engines in the family. The results of these tests must be averaged according to procedures of § 90.709.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 90.711</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any engine failing pursuant to § 90.710(a) effective from the time that testing of that engine is completed.</P>

              <P>(b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for an engine family which is determined to be in noncompliance pursuant to § 90.710(b). This suspension will not <PRTPAGE P="287"/>occur before thirty days after the engine family is determined to be in noncompliance and the Administrator has notified the manufacturer of its intent to suspend. During this thirty day period the Administrator will work with the manufacturer to achieve appropriate production line changes to avoid the need to halt engine production, if possible. The Administrator will approve or disapprove any such production line changes proposed to address a family that has been determined to be in noncompliance under this subpart within 15 days of receipt. If the Administrator does not approve or disapprove such a proposed change within such time period, the proposed change shall be considered approved.</P>
              <P>(c) If the results of testing pursuant to the regulations in this subpart indicate that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the regulations in this part with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the application for certification may be covered by a certificate of conformity, the Administrator may suspend such certificate immediately in whole or in part if the Administrator finds any one of the following infractions to be substantial:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) An EPA enforcement officer is denied the opportunity to conduct activities authorized in this subpart and a warrant or court order is presented to the manufacturer or the party in charge of the facility in question.</P>
              <P>(5) An EPA enforcement officer is unable to conduct activities authorized in § 90.705 because a manufacturer has located its facility in a foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits those activities.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in part, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for an engine family after the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as reported by the manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as described in the application for certification of the affected engine family.</P>
              <P>(g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine:</P>
              <P>(1) Remedy the nonconformity;</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine conforms to the applicable standards (FELs, where applicable) by retesting the engine in accordance with these regulations; and</P>
              <P>(3) Submit a written report to the Administrator, described in § 90.709(e)(7), after successful completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other information that may be required by this part.</P>
              <P>(h) Once a certificate for a failed engine family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate:</P>

              <P>(1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on <PRTPAGE P="288"/>which the remedies will be implemented; and</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with the regulations of this part by testing as many engines as needed so that the CumSum statistic, as calculated in § 90.708(a), falls below the action limit. Such testing must comply with the provisions of this part. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for any engine actually determined to be in conformance with the Family Emission Limits (or standards if no FEL) through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Once the certificate has been revoked for an engine family, if the manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before the Administrator may issue a certificate for that modified family:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer within five working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (h)(1) of this section whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to evaluate the proposed change or changes or whether additional testing will be required;</P>
              <P>(2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the modified engine family does in fact conform with the regulations of this part by testing as many engines as needed from the modified engine family so that the CumSum statistic, as calculated in § 90.708(a) using the newly assigned FEL if applicable, falls below the action limit; and</P>
              <P>(3) When the requirements of paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section are met, the Administrator shall reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family. As long as the CumSum statistic remains above the action limit, the revocation remains in effect.</P>
              <P>(j) At any time subsequent to a suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than 15 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.</P>
              <P>(k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph (d) of this section shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with §§ 90.712 and 90.713; and</P>
              <P>(2) Not apply to engines no longer in the possession of the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section and prior to the commencement of a hearing under § 90.712, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend or revoke the certificate was based on erroneous information, the Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.</P>
              <P>(m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines while conducting subsequent testing of the noncomplying family, a manufacturer may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the following condition: the manufacturer must commit to performing offsetting measures that remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owners, and which are approved in advance by the Administrator for all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the CumSum statistic does not fall below the action limit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request for public hearing.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision to <PRTPAGE P="289"/>suspend or revoke a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to § 90.711(a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer's request shall be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of his or her decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer shall simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Manager of the Engine Compliance Programs Group and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk for the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his or her discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.</P>
              <P>(c) A manufacturer shall include in the request for a public hearing:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement as to which engine configuration(s) within a family is to be the subject of the hearing; and</P>
              <P>(2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing requested under § 90.711(j), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether tests have been properly conducted (specifically, whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning);</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether sampling plans and statistical analyses have been properly applied (specifically, whether sampling procedures and statistical analyses specified in this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines produced at plants other than the one from which engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's decision under § 90.711(c));</P>
              <P>(3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and</P>
              <P>(4) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's position on each of the issues raised.</P>
              <P>(d) A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available to the public during Agency business hours.</P>

              <P>(a) Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the following:</P>
              <P>(1) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance with § 90.1004(b), and in accordance with subsection (b) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption, in accordance with subsection (c) of this section;</P>
              <P>(3) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(4) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control consonant with the purpose of the program and EPA's monitoring requirements, in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item of information.</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under § 90.1003. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.</P>

              <P>(d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration <PRTPAGE P="294"/>of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) An estimate of the program's duration; and</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum number of nonroad engines involved.</P>
              <P>(e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) The technical nature of the test;</P>
              <P>(2) The site of the test;</P>
              <P>(3) The duration and accumulated engine operation associated with the test;</P>
              <P>(4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in the test;</P>
              <P>(5) The intended final disposition of the engines;</P>
              <P>(6) The manner in which the engines used in the test will be identified, and that identification recorded, and made available; and</P>
              <P>(7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.</P>
              <P>(f) A manufacturer of new nonroad engines may request a testing exemption to cover nonroad engines intended for use in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. Unless otherwise required by the Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the recordkeeping and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes consistent with § 90.1004(b).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Granting of exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made pursuant to § 90.905 or § 90.908, EPA determines it is appropriate to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption is to be prepared and submitted to the person requesting the exemption. The memorandum is to set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and such terms and conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and conditions generally include, but are not limited to, agreements by the applicant to conduct the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, create and maintain adequate records accessible to EPA at reasonable times, employ labels for the exempt engines setting forth the nature of the exemption, take appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the exemption are met, and advise EPA of the termination of the activity and the ultimate disposition of the engines.</P>

              <P>(b) Any exemption granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is deemed to cover any subject engine only to the extent that the specified terms and conditions are complied with. A breach of any term or condition causes the exemption to be void ab initio with respect to any engine. Consequently, the causing or the performing of an act prohibited under § 90.1003(a) (1) or (3), other than in <PRTPAGE P="296"/>strict conformity with all terms and conditions of this exemption, renders the person to whom the exemption is granted, and any other person to whom the provisions of § 90.1003 are applicable, liable to suit under sections 204 and 205 of the Act.</P>

              <P>(i) Until December 31, 2009, converting an engine to use a clean alternative fuel (as defined in Title II of the Act) is not considered a prohibited act under paragraph (a) of this section if the engine complies with the applicable standard when operating on the alternative fuel. Also, in the case of engines converted to dual fuel or flexible use, the action must result in the proper functioning of the nonroad engine when it operates on conventional fuel.</P>
              <P>(ii) The provisions of 40 CFR 1054.645 apply starting January 1, 2010.</P>

              <P>(4) Certified nonroad engines shall be used in all equipment or vehicles that are self-propelled, portable, transportable, or are intended to be propelled while performing their function, unless the manufacturer of the equipment or vehicle can prove that the vehicle or equipment will be used in a manner consistent with paragraph (2) of the definition of <E T="03">Nonroad engine</E> in § 90.3. Nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers may continue to use noncertified nonroad engines built prior to the applicable implementation date of <PRTPAGE P="298"/>the Phase 1 rule until noncertified engine inventories are depleted; further after the applicable implementation of the Phase 2 regulations in this part, nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers may continue to use Phase 1 engines until Phase 1 engine inventories are depleted. Stockpiling (i.e., build up of an inventory of uncertified engines or Phase 1 engines beyond normal business practices to avoid or delay compliance with the Phase 1 or Phase 2 regulations in this part, respectively) will be considered a violation of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) A new nonroad engine, intended solely to replace an engine in a piece of nonroad equipment that was originally produced with an engine manufactured prior to the applicable implementation date as described in §§ 90.2, 90.103 and 90.106, or with an engine that was originally produced in a model year in which less stringent standards under this part were in effect, shall not be subject to the requirements of § 90.106 or prohibitions and provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(4) of this section provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The engine manufacturer has ascertained that no engine produced by itself or the manufacturer of the engine that is being replaced, if different, and certified to the requirements of this subpart, is available with the appropriate physical or performance characteristics to repower the equipment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The engine manufacturer or its agent takes ownership and possession of the old engine in partial exchange for the replacement engine; and</P>

              <P>(iii) The replacement engine is clearly labeled with the following language, or similar alternate language approved in advance by the Administrator:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <FP>THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH FEDERAL NONROAD OR ON-HIGHWAY EMISSION REQUIREMENTS. SALE OR INSTALLATION OF THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN AS A REPLACEMENT ENGINE IN A NONROAD VEHICLE OR PIECE OF NONROAD EQUIPMENT WHOSE ORIGINAL ENGINE WAS NOT CERTIFIED, OR WAS CERTIFIED TO LESS STRINGENT EMISSION STANDARDS THAN THOSE THAT APPLY TO THE YEAR OF MANUFACTURE OF THIS ENGINE, IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY;</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <FP>and</FP>
              <P>(iv) Where the replacement engine is intended to replace an engine built after the applicable implementation date of regulations under this part, but built to less stringent emission standards than are currently applicable, the replacement engine shall be identical in all material respects to a certified configuration of the same or later model year as the engine being replaced.</P>
              <P>(v) In cases where an engine is to be imported for replacement purposes under the provisions of this paragraph (b)(5), the term “engine manufacturer” shall not apply to an individual or other entity that does not possess a current Certificate of Conformity issued by EPA under this part.</P>
              <P>(6)(i) Regulations elsewhere in this part notwithstanding, for three model years after the phase-in of each set of Class I through Class V Phase 2 standards; i.e. up to and including August 1, 2010 for Class I engines, up to and including model year 2008 for Class II engines, up to and including model year 2008 for Class III and Class IV engines, and up to and including model year 2010 for Class V engines, small volume equipment manufacturers as defined in this part, may continue to use, and engine manufacturers may continue to supply, engines certified to Phase 1 standards (or identified and labeled by their manufacturer to be identical to engines previously certified under Phase 1 standards), provided the equipment manufacturer has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that no certified Phase 2 engine is available with suitable physical or performance characteristics to power a piece of equipment in production prior to the initial effective date of Phase 2 standards, as indicated in § 90.103(a). The equipment manufacturer must also certify to the Administrator that the equipment model has not undergone any redesign which could have facilitated conversion of the equipment to accommodate a Phase 2 engine. These provisions do not apply to Class I-A and Class I-B engines.</P>

              <P>(ii) Regulations elsewhere in this part notwithstanding, for the duration of the Phase 2 rule in this part, equipment manufacturers that produce <PRTPAGE P="299"/>small volume equipment models, as defined in this part, for a Class I model in production prior to August 1, 2007, or a Class II model in production prior to the 2001 model year, or a Class III or Class IV model in production prior to the 2002 model year, or a Class V model in production prior to the 2004 model year, may continue to use in that small volume equipment model, and engine manufacturers may continue to supply, engines certified to Phase 1 requirements (or identified and labeled by their manufacturer to be identical to engines previously certified under Phase 1 standards). To be eligible for this provision, the equipment manufacturer must have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that no certified Phase 2 engine is available with suitable physical or performance characteristics to power the small volume equipment model. The equipment manufacturer must also certify to the Administrator that the equipment model has not undergone any redesign which could have facilitated conversion of the equipment to accommodate a Phase 2 engine. These provisions do not apply to Class I-A and Class I-B engines.</P>
              <P>(iii) An equipment manufacturer which is unable to obtain suitable Phase 2 engines and which can not obtain relief under any other provision of this part, may, prior to the date on which the manufacturer would become in noncompliance with the requirement to use Phase 2 engines, apply to the Administrator to be allowed to continue using Phase 1 engines, through August 1, 2008 for Class I engines, through the 2006 model year for Class II engines, through the 2006 model year for Class III and Class IV engines, and through the 2008 model year for Class V engines, subject to the following criteria (These provisions do not apply to Class I-A and Class I-B engines.):</P>
              <P>(A) The inability to obtain Phase 2 engines is despite the manufacturer's best efforts and is the result of an extraordinary action on the part of the engine manufacturer that was outside the control of and could not be reasonably foreseen by the equipment manufacturer; such as canceled production or shipment, last minute certification failure, unforeseen engine cancellation, plant closing, work stoppage or other such circumstance; and</P>
              <P>(B) the inability to market the particular equipment will bring substantial economic hardship to the equipment manufacturer resulting in a major impact on the equipment manufacturer's solvency.</P>
              <P>(iv) The written permission from the Administrator to the equipment manufacturer shall serve as permission for the engine manufacturer to provide such Phase 1 engines required by the equipment manufacturers under this paragraph (b)(6) of this section. As Phase 1 engines, these engines are exempt from Production Line Testing requirements under subpart H of this part and in-use testing provisions under subpart M of this part, and are excluded from the certification averaging, banking and trading program of subpart C of this part.</P>
              <P>(7) Actions for the purpose of installing or removing altitude kits and performing other changes to compensate for altitude change as described in the application for certification pursuant to § 90.107(d) and approved at the time of certification pursuant to § 90.108(a) are not considered prohibited acts under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, the defendant resides, or the Administrator's principal place of business is located, and in which the court has jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under this paragraph, the court is to take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(3) In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative assessment of certain penalties.</E> (1) Administrative penalty authority. In lieu of commencing a civil action under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator shall assess any civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty assessment proceeding can not exceed $270,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty is made by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions, any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determining amount.</E> In determining the amount of any civil penalty assessed under this subsection, the Administrator is to take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of administrator's action.</E> (i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph does not affect or limit the Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of this part; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this part, or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this part may not be the subject of a civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) No action by the Administrator under this part affects a person's obligation to comply with a section of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Finality of order.</E> An order issued under this part becomes final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> (i) A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this part <PRTPAGE P="302"/>may seek review of the assessment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principle place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. The person must simultaneously send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator must file in the court within 30 days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Collection.</E> (i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator is to request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the date of the final order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty are not subject to review.</P>
              <P>(ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section is required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.</P>

              <P>(a) Warranties imposed by this subpart shall be for the first two years of engine use from the date of sale to the ultimate purchaser. Manufacturers of handheld engines subject to Phase 2 standards may apply to the Administrator for approval for a warranty period of less than two years for handheld engines that are subject to severe service in seasonal equipment and are likely to run their full useful life hours in less than two years. Such an application must be made prior to certification. Alternatively, manufacturers of handheld engines subject to Phase 2 <PRTPAGE P="303"/>standards may apply to the Administrator for approval for a warranty period equal to the useful life of the engine or two years, whichever is less, if the equipment in which the engine is placed is equipped with a meter for measuring hours of use. Such an application must be made prior to certification.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer of each new nonroad engine must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the engine is designed, built and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and the engine is free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of a nonroad engine part, the manufacturer or rebuilder of the part may certify according to § 85.2112 of this chapter that use of the part will not result in a failure of the engine to comply with emission standards promulgated in this part.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any nonroad engine warranted under this part is responsible for the proper maintenance of the engine as stated in the manufacturer's written instructions. Proper maintenance generally includes replacement and service, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, such items as spark plugs, points, condensers, and any other part, item, or device related to emission control (but not designed for emission control) under the terms of the last sentence of section 207(a)(3) of the Act, unless such part, item, or device is covered by any warranty not mandated by this Act.</P>
              <P>(e) Starting with the 2010 model year, you must meet the conditions specified in 40 CFR 1054.120(f) to ensure that owners will be able to promptly obtain warranty repairs.</P>
              <P>Describe in your application for certification how you will meet these conditions.</P>

              <P>(a) The manufacturer must furnish or cause to be furnished to the ultimate purchaser of each new nonroad engine written instructions for the maintenance needed to assure proper functioning of the emission control system.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer must provide in boldface type on the first page of the written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance, replacement, or repair of the emission control devices and systems may be performed by any nonroad engine repair establishment or individual.</P>
              <P>(c) The instructions under paragraph (b) of this section will not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's using, in connection with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Such instructions also will not directly or indirectly distinguish between service performed by the franchised dealers of such manufacturer or any other service establishments with which such manufacturer has a commercial relationship and service performed by independent nonroad engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer has no commercial relationship.</P>
              <P>(d) The prohibition of paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by the Administrator if:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the engine will function properly only if the component or service so identified is used in connection with such engine; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public interest.</P>

              <P>(e) If a manufacturer includes in an advertisement a statement respecting the cost or value of emission control devices or systems, the manufacturer shall set forth in the statement the cost or value attributed to these devices or systems by the Secretary of Labor (through the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The Secretary of Labor, and his or her representatives, has the same access for this purpose to the books, documents, papers, and records of a manufacturer as the Comptroller General has to those of a recipient of <PRTPAGE P="304"/>assistance for purposes of section 311 of the Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Voluntary Manufacturer In-Use Testing Program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Manufacturers may elect to participate in the voluntary in-use testing program by notifying the Administrator in writing of their intent to conduct emissions testing on in-use engines prior to the beginning of each model year. The notification must include a list of engine families the manufacturer has selected to include in the testing program.</P>
              <P>(b) Each engine family included in the voluntary in-use testing program is exempted from the Production Line Testing requirements according to § 90.701(c) for two model years, the current model year and the subsequent model year. Manufacturers may only include up to twenty percent of their eligible engine families in this in-use testing program each model year.</P>
              <P>(c) The manufacturer must randomly select or procure a minimum of three engines, from each family included in the voluntary program, for emissions testing. These three engines may be selected or procured from:</P>
              <P>(1) Existing consumer or independently owned fleets,</P>
              <P>(2) Existing manufacturer owned fleets, or</P>
              <P>(3) The production line and placed into either manufacturer or consumer owned fleets. Although a minimum of three engines must be emissions tested from each engine family in this testing program, a manufacturer may elect to emissions test more than three engines per family.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer or the manufacturer's designee must:</P>
              <P>(1) Age the selected engines in equipment representing the top 50 percent, by production, of available equipment for the engine family.</P>
              <P>(2) Age the selected engines to at least 75 percent of each engines' useful life as determined pursuant to § 90.105.</P>
              <P>(3) Age the engine/equipment combination in actual field conditions encountered with typical use of the equipment as described in the owner's manual or other literature sold with the equipment or engine.</P>
              <P>(e) Documents obtained in the procurement or aging process must be maintained as required in § 90.121.</P>
              <P>(f) The manufacturer must complete testing within three calendar years from the time they notified the Administrator of their intent to participate in the voluntary in-use testing program, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator; the Administrator will give such approval upon acceptance of documentation demonstrating that appropriate in-use testing will take a longer period of time.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Maintenance, aging and testing of engines.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Prior to aging the engines and after appropriate stabilization, manufacturers may optionally conduct emissions testing on the engines, according to the test procedures described in subpart E of this part. These tests to serve as baseline references.</P>
              <P>(b) Manufacturers must obtain information regarding the accumulated usage, maintenance, operating conditions, and storage of the test engines.</P>

              <P>(1) The manufacturer may take reasonable measures to assure that the engines and equipment were properly used and maintained during the field aging process, but additional maintenance to that indicated in the owners manual or other literature sold with the equipment or engine is prohibited.<PRTPAGE P="305"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, once a manufacturer begins aging and/or testing an engine, the manufacturer may not remove that engine from the selected sample unless that engine experiences catastrophic mechanical failure or safety concerns requiring major engine repair.</P>
              <P>(c) The manufacturer may perform minimal set-to-spec maintenance on components of a test engine that are not subject to parameter adjustment. Components subject to parameter adjustment must be sealed and tamperproof and may not be adjusted for testing. Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, maintenance to any test engine may include only that which is listed in the owner's instructions for engines with the amount of service and age of the test engine.</P>
              <P>(d) After aging each engine to at least 75 percent of the engine's useful life as determined pursuant to § 90.105, at least one valid emission test, according to the test procedure outlined in subpart E of this part, is required for each test engine. Data from other emission testing or performance testing performed on a test engine must be supplied to EPA, and may not be used for the purpose of determining the need for maintenance on an engine.</P>
              <P>(e) Documents obtained in the procurement, aging, maintenance, or testing process must be maintained as required in § 90.121.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Certification procedure—determining engine power and engine families.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Engine power must be calculated using SAE J1228. This procedure has been incorporated by reference. <E T="03">See</E> § 91.6.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer's product line must be divided into engine families as specified by paragraph (c) of this section, comprised of engines expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their useful life periods.</P>
              <P>(c) To be classed in the same engine family, engines must be identical in all of the following applicable respects:</P>
              <P>(1) The combustion cycle;</P>
              <P>(2) The cooling mechanism;</P>
              <P>(3) The cylinder configuration (inline, vee, opposed, bore spacings, and so forth);</P>
              <P>(4) The number of cylinders;</P>
              <P>(5) The number of catalytic converters, location; volume, and composition; and</P>
              <P>(6) The thermal reactor characteristics.</P>
              <P>(d) At the manufacturer's request, engines identical in all the respects listed in paragraph (c) of this section may be further divided into different engine families if the Administrator determines that they may be expected to have different emission characteristics. This determination is based upon the consideration of features such as:</P>
              <P>(1) The bore and stroke;</P>
              <P>(2) The combustion chamber configuration;</P>
              <P>(3) The intake and exhaust timing method of actuation (poppet valve, reed valve, rotary valve, and so forth);</P>
              <P>(4) The intake and exhaust valve or port sizes, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(5) The fuel system;</P>
              <P>(6) The exhaust system; and</P>
              <P>(7) The method of air aspiration.</P>
              <P>(e) Where engines are of a type which cannot be divided into engine families based upon the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator shall establish families for those engines based upon the features most related to their emission characteristics.</P>
              <P>(f) Upon a showing by the manufacturer that the emission characteristics during the useful life are expected to be similar, engines differing in one or more of the characteristics in paragraph (c) of this section may be grouped in the same engine family.</P>
              <P>(g) Upon a showing by the manufacturer that the emission characteristics during the useful life are expected to be dissimilar, engines identical in all the characteristics in paragraph (c) of this section may be divided into separate engine families.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) Any engine required to be tested under § 91.118 must be operated with all emission control systems operating properly for a period sufficient to stabilize emissions prior to such testing.</P>
              <P>(2) A manufacturer may elect to consider emission levels as stabilized when the test engine has accumulated 12 hours of service.</P>
              <P>(b) No maintenance, other than recommended lubrication and filter changes, may be performed during service accumulation without the Administrator's approval.</P>
              <P>(c) Service accumulation is to be performed in a manner using good engineering judgment to ensure that emissions are representative of production engines.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer must maintain, and provide to the Administrator if requested, records stating the rationale for selecting a service accumulation period different than 12 hours and records describing the method used to accumulate hours on the test engine(s).</P>

              <P>(1) The test procedures to be used are detailed in subpart E of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Emission test equipment provisions are described in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrator testing.</E> (1) The Administrator may require that any one or more of the test engines be submitted to the Administrator, at such place or places as the Administrator may designate, for the purposes of conducting emission tests. The Administrator may specify that testing will be conducted at the manufacturer's facility, in which case instrumentation and equipment specified by the Administrator must be made available by the manufacturer for test operations. Any testing conducted at a manufacturer's facility must be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as possible.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test engine, the results of that test will, unless subsequently invalidated by the Administrator, comprise the official data for the engine and the manufacturer's data will not be used in determining compliance with the Family Emission Limit (FEL).</P>
              <P>(ii) Prior to the performance of such a test, the Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any adjustable parameter of the test engine which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for testing, to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, to determine whether the engine conforms to the applicable Family Emission Limit (FEL).</P>
              <P>(iii) For those engine parameters which the Administrator has not determined to be subject to adjustment for testing, the test engine presented to the Administrator for testing will be calibrated within the production tolerances applicable to the manufacturer specification shown on the engine label, as specified in the application for certification.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of carryover test data.</E> In lieu of testing, the manufacturer may submit, with the Administrator's approval, emission test data used to certify substantially similar engine families in previous years. This “carryover” test data is only allowable if the data shows the test engine would fully comply with the applicable Family Emission Limit (FEL).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Scheduled maintenance during testing.</E> No scheduled maintenance may be performed during testing of the engine.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Unscheduled maintenance on test engines.</E> (1) Manufacturers may not perform any unscheduled engine, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on a test engine without the advance approval of the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator may approve such maintenance if:<PRTPAGE P="319"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) A preliminary determination has been made that a part failure or system malfunction, or the repair of such failure or malfunction, does not render the engine unrepresentative of engines in use, and does not require direct access to the combustion chamber; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A determination has been made that the need for maintenance or repairs is indicated by an overt malfunction such as persistent misfire, engine stall, overheating, fluid leakage, or loss of oil pressure.</P>
              <P>(3) Emission measurements may not be used as a means of determining the need for unscheduled maintenance under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The Administrator must have the opportunity to verify the extent of any overt indication of part failure (for example, misfire, stall), or an activation of an audible and/or visual signal, prior to the manufacturer performing any maintenance related to such overt indication or signal.</P>
              <P>(5) Unless approved by the Administrator prior to use, engine manufacturers may not use any equipment, instruments, or tools to identify malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools are available at dealerships and other service outlets and are used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such components.</P>
              <P>(6) If the Administrator determines that part failure or system malfunction occurrence and/or repair rendered the engine unrepresentative of production engines, the engine may not be used as a test engine.</P>
              <P>(7) Unless waived by the Administrator, complete emission tests are required before and after any engine maintenance which may reasonably be expected to affect emissions.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Engine failure.</E> A manufacturer may not use as a test engine any engine which incurs major mechanical failure necessitating disassembly of the engine. This prohibition does not apply to failures which occur after completion of the service accumulation period.</P>
              <P>(g) In lieu of providing or generating emission data under this section for existing technology, the Administrator may allow the manufacturer to demonstrate (on the basis of previous emission tests, development tests, or other testing information) that the engine will conform with the applicable FEL.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) Manufacturers may select an FEL for existing technology OB/PWC through:</P>
              <P>(i) Model year 2000 based on the function 151 + 557/P <SU>0.9</SU> where P = average power of an engine family in kW (sales weighted). The power of each configuration is the rated output in kilowatts as determined by SAE J1228. (This procedure has been incorporated by reference. See § 91.6). The certificate of conformity would be conditioned by requirements that the manufacturer submit test data, as determined appropriate by the Administrator under § 91.118(h) by the end of model year 2000; that the FEL is revised and approved by EPA to reflect the test data; that the credits associated with the engine family are recalculated based on the difference between the old FEL and the new FEL; and that the new FEL applies to all engines covered by the certificate of conformity; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Model year 2003 based on good engineering judgement.</P>

              <P>(2) Upon request by the manufacturer, the Administrator has the discretion to extend the time period set forth in paragraph (h)(1) of this section for a specific engine family up to model year 2005 if the Administrator determines that an engine family will be phased out of U.S. production by model year 2005. As a condition to being granted such an extension, the manufacturer must discontinue U.S. production according to the schedule upon which the Administrator based the extension. Failure to do so by the manufacturer will void the certificate of conformity <E T="03">ab initio.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(i) A manufacturer request under paragraph (h)(2) of this section must be in writing and must apply to a specific engine family. The request must identify the engine family designation, the rationale supporting the FEL choice, the type of information used as a basis for the FEL (e.g., previous emission tests, development tests), the specific source of the information including when the information was generated, the schedule for phasing the engine family out of U.S. production, and any <PRTPAGE P="320"/>other information the Administrator may require.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of alternative test procedures by an engine manufacturer.</E> (1) A manufacturer may elect to use an alternative test procedure provided that it yields results equivalent to the results from the specified test procedure in subpart E, its use is approved in advance by the Administrator, and the basis for equivalent results with the specified test procedures is fully described in the manufacturer's application.</P>
              <P>(2) An engine manufacturer electing to use alternate test procedures is solely responsible for the results obtained. The Administrator may reject data generated under test procedures which do not correlate with data generated under the specified procedures.</P>

The manufacturer must identify in its application for certification that the engines were tested using the procedures in 40 CFR part 1065. For any EPA testing with engines subject to standards under this part, EPA will use the manufacturer's selected procedures for mapping engines, generating duty cycles, and applying cycle-validation criteria. For any other parameters, EPA may conduct testing using either of the specified procedures.</P>
              <P>(4) Where we specify mandatory compliance with the procedures of 40 CFR part 1065, manufacturers may elect to use the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N, as an alternate test procedure without advance approval by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) The engine Family Emission Limits (FELs) apply to the emissions of engines for their useful lives.</P>
              <P>(2) Since emission control efficiency generally decreases with the accumulation of service on the engine, deterioration factors must be used in combination with emission data engine test results as the basis for determining compliance with the standards.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section describes the procedure for determining compliance of an engine with family emission limits, based on deterioration factors supplied by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Separate exhaust emission deterioration factors, determined by the manufacturer, must be supplied for each engine family. The deterioration factors must be applied as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) For marine spark-ignition engines not utilizing aftertreatment technology (for example, catalytic converters), the official exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at the selected test point are adjusted by adding the appropriate deterioration factor to the results. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it is zero for the purposes of this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(B) For marine spark-ignition engines utilizing aftertreatment technology (for example, catalytic converters), the official exhaust emission results for each emission data engine at the selected test point are adjusted <PRTPAGE P="321"/>by multiplying the results by the appropriate deterioration factor. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than one, it is one for the purposes of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(iii) The emission values to compare with the Family Emission Limits (FELs) are the adjusted emission values of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, rounded to the same number of significant figures as contained in the applicable standard in accordance with ASTM E 29-93a, for each emission data engine.

Notification occurs when the manufacturer submits and EPA receives a request to amend the original application prior to either producing such engines or making such changes to a product line. For existing technology OB/PWC engines only, notification may occur periodically but must occur at least on a quarterly basis and may be submitted summarily as determined by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) When an FEL is changed for an engine family, as allowed under § 91.203. Notification occurs when the manufacturer submits and EPA receives a request to amend the original application. The manufacturer may not <PRTPAGE P="322"/>change an FEL unless compliance under § 91.207(b) is maintained through the use of the revised FEL.</P>
              <P>(b) The request to amend the engine manufacturer's existing certificate of conformity must include the following information:</P>

The manufacturer may request a hearing on a denial. See § 91.125.</P>
              <P>(4) If the Administrator determines that the revised FEL meets the requirements of this subpart and the Act, the appropriate certificate of conformity will be amended to reflect the revised FEL. The certificate of conformity is revised conditional upon compliance under § 91.207(b).</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Alternatively, an engine manufacturer may make changes in or additions to production engines concurrently with requesting to amend the application or certification of conformity as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, if the manufacturer determines that all affected engines will still meet applicable Family Emission Limits (FELs). The engine manufacturer must supply supporting documentation, test data, and engineering evaluations as appropriate to support its determination.</P>
              <P>(2) If, after a review, the Administrator determines additional testing is required, the engine manufacturer must provide required test data within 30 days or cease production of the affected engines.</P>

              <P>The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The following definitions also apply to this subpart:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Averaging</E> for marine SI engines means the exchange of emission credits among engine families within a given manufacturer's product line.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Banking</E> means the retention of marine SI engine emission credits by the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use in future model year averaging or trading as permitted by these regulations.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Eligible</E> sales means marine SI engines sold for purposes of being used in the United States and include any engine introduced into commerce in the U.S. to be sold for use in the U.S.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Emission credits</E> represent the amount of emission reduction or exceedance, by a marine SI engine family, below or above the applicable emission standard, respectively. Emission reductions below the standard are considered as “positive credits,” while emission exceedances above the standard are considered as “negative credits.” In addition, “projected credits” refer to emission credits based on the projected applicable production/sales volume of the engine family. “Reserved credits” are emission credits generated within a model year waiting to be reported to EPA at the end of the model year. “Actual credits” refer to emission <PRTPAGE P="324"/>credits based on actual applicable production/sales volume as contained in the end-of-year reports submitted to EPA. Some or all of these credits may be revoked if EPA review of the end-of-year reports or any subsequent audit action(s) uncovers problems or errors.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Point of first retail sale</E> means the point at which the engine is first sold directly to an end user. Generally, this point is the retail boat or engine dealer. If the engine is sold first to a boat or vessel manufacturer for installation in a boat or vessel, the boat or vessel manufacturer may be the point of first retail sale if the boat or vessel manufacturer can determine if the engine is or is not exported once they have sold the boat or vessel. If the boat or vessel manufacturer cannot determine if the engine is or is not exported once they have sold the boat or vessel, the engine is presumed to not be exported, unless the engine manufacturer can demonstrate otherwise. Engine manufacturers must include engines in their average if the engine is exported and subsequently imported into the United States installed in a boat or vessel and introduced into United States commerce.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Trading</E> means the exchange of marine engine emission credits between manufacturers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The certification averaging, banking, and trading provisions for hydrocarbon plus oxides of nitrogen emissions from eligible marine SI engines are described in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) A marine SI engine family must use the averaging provisions and may use the banking and trading provisions for hydrocarbon plus oxides of nitrogen emissions if it is subject to regulation under subpart B of this part with certain exceptions specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) Manufacturers of marine SI engines may not use the banking and trading provisions for new marine SI engines:</P>
              <P>(1) Which are exported, or</P>
              <P>(2) Which are subject to state engine emission standards unless the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator that inclusion of these engines in banking and trading is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) A manufacturer may certify marine SI engine families at Family Emission Limits (FELs) above or below the applicable emission standard, provided the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all credit transactions in a given model year is greater than or equal to zero, as determined under § 91.207.</P>
              <P>(1) A manufacturer of an engine family with an FEL exceeding the applicable emission standard must obtain positive emission credits sufficient to address the associated credit shortfall via averaging, banking, or trading.</P>
              <P>(2) An engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard may generate positive emission credits for averaging, banking, or trading, or a combination thereof. Emission credits may not be used to offset an engine family's emissions that exceed its applicable FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy nonconformity determined by a production line testing, a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) or by recall (in-use) testing. However, in the case of a manufacturer production line testing or SEA failure, credits may be used to allow subsequent production of engines for the family in question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL. In the case of production line testing a manufacturer may revise the FEL based upon production line testing results obtained under subpart F and upon Administrator approval pursuant to § 91.122(d).</P>
              <P>(e) Credits generated in a given model year may be used in the following three model years. Credits not used by the end of the third model year after being generated are forfeited. Credits generated in one model year may not be used for prior model years, unless allowed under § 91.207.</P>

              <P>(f) Manufacturers must demonstrate compliance under the averaging, banking, and trading provisions for a particular model year by 270 days after the model year. An engine family generating negative credits for which the manufacturer does not obtain or generate an adequate number of positive credits from the same or previous model years will violate the conditions of the certificate of conformity. The <PRTPAGE P="325"/>certificate of conformity may be voided <E T="03">ab initio</E> pursuant to § 91.123 for this engine family.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Averaging.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Negative credits from engine families with FELs above the applicable emission standard must be offset by positive credits from engine families below the applicable emission standard, as allowed under the provisions of this subpart. Averaging of credits in this manner is used to determine compliance under § 91.207(b).</P>
              <P>(b) For model years through 2000, outboard credits may not be summed with personal watercraft credits, or vice versa, for purposes of compliance under § 91.207, except manufacturers may, at their discretion, include personal watercraft credits with outboard credits upon demonstration to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the personal watercraft engine is installed in a hybrid vessel that is smaller than a typical sterndrive or inboard vessel and larger than a typical personal watercraft. For model year 2001 and later, manufacturers must sum credits generated from outboard and personal watercraft to determine compliance under § 91.207.</P>
              <P>(c) Credits used in averaging may be obtained from credits generated by another engine family as allowed under § 91.204(b), in the same model year, credits banked in the three previous model years, or credits obtained through trading.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Banking.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A manufacturer of a marine SI engine family with an FEL below the applicable emission standard for a given model year may bank credits in that model year for use in averaging and trading in the following three model years. Negative credits must be banked according to the requirements under § 91.207(c). Positive credits not used within the three model years after they are banked are forfeited.</P>
              <P>(1) Early banking. (i) For outboard engines in model year (MY) 1997, a manufacturer may bank positive emission credits if the following conditions are met: the manufacturer certifies their entire marine outboard engine product line for MY 1997 under the emission standards applicable to MY 1998, the manufacturer demonstrates compliance with the corporate average standard under § 91.207(b), and the sum of positive and negative credits under § 91.207 generates positive emission credits, when the following formula is used for purposes of the applicable standard in § 91.207(a). The number of credits that may be banked under this paragraph is the number of positive emission credits generated under the provisions of the preceding sentence. Marine engines certified under the provisions of this paragraph are subject to all of the requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(2) Calibrate the HCLD in the most common operating range following the manufacturer's specifications using zero and span gas (the NO content of which must amount to about 80 percent of the operating range and the NO<E T="52">2</E> concentration of the gas mixture less than 5 percent of the NO concentration). The NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer must be in the NO mode so that the span gas does not pass through the converter. Record the indicated concentration.</P>

              <P>(4) Via a T-fitting, add oxygen continuously to the gas flow until the concentration indicated is about 20 percent less than the indicated calibration concentration given in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Record the indicated concentration as “c”. The ozonator is kept deactivated throughout the process.</P>
              <P>(5) Activate the ozonator to generate enough ozone to bring the NO concentration down to about 20 percent (minimum 10 percent) of the calibration concentration given in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Record the indicated concentration as “d”.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Analyzer interference checks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Gases present in the exhaust other than the one being analyzed can interfere with the reading in several ways. Positive interference occurs in NDIR and PMD instruments when the interfering gas gives the same effect as the gas being measured, but to a lesser degree. Negative interference occurs in NDIR instruments by the interfering gas broadening the absorption band of the measured gas, and in CLD instruments by the interfering gas quenching the radiation. The interference checks described in this section are to be made initially and after any major repairs that could affect analyzer performance.</P>
              <P>(b) CO analyzer water and CO<E T="52">2</E> interference checks. Bubble through water at room temperature a CO<E T="52">2</E> span gas having a concentration of between 80 percent and 100 percent inclusive of full scale of the maximum operating range used during testing and record the analyzer response. For dry measurements, this mixture may be introduced into the sample system prior to the water trap. The analyzer response must not be more than one percent of full scale for ranges equal to or above 300 ppm or more than three ppm for ranges below 300 ppm.</P>
              <P>(c) NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer quench check. The two gases of concern for CLD (and HCLD) analyzers are CO<E T="52">2</E> and water vapor. Quench responses to these two gases are proportional to their concentrations and, therefore, require test techniques to determine quench at the highest expected concentrations experienced during testing.</P>
              <P>(1) NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer CO<E T="52">2</E> quench check. (i) Pass a CO<E T="52">2</E> span gas having a concentration of 80 percent to 100 percent of full scale of the maximum operating range used during testing through the CO<E T="52">2</E> NDIR analyzer and record the value as “a.”</P>
              <P>(ii) Dilute the CO<E T="52">2</E> span gas approximately 50 percent with NO span gas and pass through the CO<E T="52">2</E> NDIR and CLD (or HCLD). Record the CO<E T="52">2</E> and NO values as “b” and “c”, respectively.</P>
              <P>(iii) Shut off the CO<E T="52">2</E> and pass only the NO span gas through the CLD (or HCLD). Record the NO value recorded as “d.”</P>
              <P>(iv) Calculate the percent CO<E T="52">2</E> quench as follows, which may not exceed three percent:

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">percent CO<E T="52">2</E> quench = 100 − 100 × [c × a/(d × a − d × b)] × a/b</FP>

              <P>(2) NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer water quench check. (i) This check applies to wet measurements only. Pass an NO span gas having a concentration of 80 percent to 100 percent of full scale of a normal operating range through the CLD (or HCLD). Record the response as “D.” Bubble through water at room temperature the NO span gas and pass it through the CLD (or HCLD). Record the analyzers response as “AR.” Determine and record the analyzers absolute operating pressure and the bubbler water temperature. (It is important that the NO span gas contains minimal NO<E T="52">2</E> concentration for this check. No allowance for absorption of NO<E T="52">2</E> in water has been made in the following quench calculations.)</P>

              <P>(ii) Calculations for water quench must consider dilution of the NO span gas with water vapor and scaling of the water vapor concentration of the mixture to that expected during testing. Determine the mixture's saturated vapor pressure (designated as “Pwb”) that corresponds to the bubbler water temperature. Calculate the water concentration (“Z1”, percent) in the mixture by the following equation:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Z1 = 100 × (Pwb / GP)</FP>

              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(iii) Calculate the expected dilute NO span gas and water vapor mixture concentration (designated as “D1”) by the following equation:

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">D1 = D × (1 − Z1/100)</FP>
              

              <P>(iv)(A) The maximum raw or dilute exhaust water vapor concentration expected during testing (designated as Wm) can be estimated from the CO<E T="52">2</E> span gas (or as defined in the equation in this paragraph and designated as A) <PRTPAGE P="343"/>criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the assumption of a fuel atom H/C ratio of 1.8:1 as:
              </P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedure overview.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating conditions to be conducted on an engine dynamometer or equivalent load and speed measurement device. The exhaust gases generated during engine operation are sampled either raw or dilute, and specific components are analyzed through the analytical system.</P>
              <P>(b) The tests are designed to determine the brake-specific emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. The test consists of one idle mode and four power modes with an exponential relationship between torque and speed which span the typical operating range of spark-ignition marine propulsion engines. These procedures require the determination of the concentration of each pollutant, fuel flow, and the power output during each mode. The measured values are weighted and used to calculate the grams of each pollutant emitted per brake kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr).</P>
              <P>(c)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions the complete engine is tested, with all emission control devices installed and functioning.</P>
              <P>(2) Additional accessories (for example, oil cooler, alternators, and so forth) may be installed, but such accessory loading will be considered parasitic in nature and observed power is used in the emission calculation.</P>
              <P>(d) All emission control systems installed on or incorporated in the application must be functioning during all procedures in this subpart. In cases of component malfunction or failure, no maintenance is allowed without prior approval from the Administrator in accordance with § 91.118.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Engine service accumulation and stabilization procedure.</E> Use the service accumulation procedure determined by the manufacturer for exhaust emission stabilizing of an engine, consistent with good engineering practice (see § 91.117).</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer determines, for each engine family, the number of hours at which the engine exhaust emission control system combination is stabilized for emission testing. However, this stabilization procedure may not exceed 12 hours. The manufacturer must maintain, and provide to the Administrator upon request, a record of the rationale used in making this determination. If the manufacturer can document that, at some time prior to the full 12 hour service accumulation period, the engine emissions are decreasing for the remainder of the 12 hours, the service accumulation may be completed at that time. The manufacturer may elect to accumulate 12 hours on each test engine within an engine family without making this determination.</P>
              <P>(2) During service accumulation, the fuel and lubricants specified in § 91.308 must be used.</P>
              <P>(3) Engine maintenance during service accumulation is allowed only in accordance with § 91.117.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Engine pre-test preparation.</E> (1) Drain and charge the fuel tank(s) with the specified test fuel (see § 91.308) to 50 percent of the tank's nominal capacity. If an external fuel tank is used, the engine fuel inlet system pressure must be typical of what the engine will see in use.</P>
              <P>(2) Operate the engine on the dynamometer measuring the fuel consumption (fuel consumption required only for raw gas sampling method) and torque before and after the emission sampling equipment is installed, including the sample probe, using mode 1 from Table 2 in appendix A of this subpart. The emission sampling equipment may not significantly affect the operational characteristics of the engine (typically, the results should agree within five percent).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Analyzer pre-test procedures.</E> (1) If necessary, warm up and stabilize the analyzer(s) before calibrations are performed.</P>

              <P>(2) Replace or clean the filter elements and then vacuum leak check the <PRTPAGE P="351"/>system per § 91.324(a). If necessary, allow the heated sample line, filters, and pumps to reach operating temperature.</P>
              <P>(3) Perform the following system checks:</P>

              <P>(i) If necessary, check the sample-line temperature. Heated FID sample line temperature must be maintained between 110 °C and 230 °C, a heated NO<E T="52">X</E> sample line temperature must be maintained between 60 °C and 230 °C.</P>
              <P>(ii) Check that the system response time has been accounted for prior to sample collection data recording.</P>
              <P>(iii) A hang-up check is permitted.</P>
              <P>(4) Check analyzer zero and span before and after each test at a minimum. Further, check analyzer zero and span any time a range change is made or at the maximum demonstrated time span for stability for each analyzer used.</P>

              <P>(2) If necessary, warm up the dynamometer as recommended by the dynamometer manufacturer ore good engineering practice.</P>
              <P>(3) At the manufacturer's option, the engine can be run with the throttle in a fixed position or by using the engine's governor (if the engine is manufactured with a governor). In either case, the engine speed and load must meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(12) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Each test consists of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Record the general test data as specified in § 91.405.</P>
              <P>(2) Precondition the engine in the following manner;</P>
              <P>(i) Operate the engine at idle for 2 to 3 minutes;</P>
              <P>(ii) Operate the engine at a power greater than or equal to 50 percent power at the rated speed for 5 to 7 minutes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Operate the engine at rated speed and maximum power for 25 to 30 minutes;</P>
              <P>(iv) Option. For four-stroke engines, where appropriate, it is permitted to precondition the engine at rated speed and maximum power until the oil and water temperatures are stabilized. The temperatures are defined as stabilized if they are maintained within 2 percent of point for 2 minutes. The engine must be operated a minimum of 10 minutes for this option. This optional procedure may be substituted for step in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii) of this section;</P>
              <P>(v) Option. If the engine has been operating on service accumulation for a minimum of 40 minutes, the service accumulation may be substituted for steps in paragraphs (b)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Record all pre-test data specified in § 91.405(c).</P>
              <P>(4) Start the test cycle (see § 91.410) within 10 minutes of the completion of the steps required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) During the first mode calculate the torque corresponding to 71.6, 46.5, and 25.3 percent of the maximum observed torque for the rated speed (see Table 2 in appendix A of this subpart).</P>
              <P>(6) Once engine speed and load are set for a mode, run the engine for a sufficient period of time to achieve thermal stability. At the manufacturers option, determine and document the appropriate criterion for thermal stability for each engine family.</P>
              <P>(7) Record all modal data specified in § 91.405(e) for a minimum time period of the last two minutes of each mode. Longer averaging periods are acceptable, but the data averaged must be from a continuous time period. The duration of time during which this data is recorded is referred to as the “sampling period.” The data collected during the sampling period is used for modal emission calculations.</P>
              <P>(8) Continuously record the analyzer's response to the exhaust gas during the sampling period.</P>
              <P>(9) Modes may be repeated.</P>
              <P>(10) If a delay of more than one hour occurs between the end of one mode and the beginning of another mode, the test is void and must be restarted as described at paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(11) The engine speed and load must be maintained within the requirements <PRTPAGE P="352"/>of § 91.410 during the sampling period for each mode. If this requirement is not met, the mode is void and must be restarted.</P>
              <P>(12) If at any time during a mode, the test equipment malfunctions or the specifications in § 91.410 can not be met, the test is void, and must be aborted. Corrective action should be taken and the test restarted.</P>
              <P>(13) Fuel flow and air flow during the idle condition may be determined just prior to or immediately following the dynamometer sequence, if longer times are required for accurate measurements. If the dilute sampling method (Constant Volume Sampling) is used, neither fuel flow nor air flow measurements are required.</P>
              <P>(c) Exhaust gas measurements. (1) Measure HC, CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration in the exhaust sample.</P>
              <P>(2) Each analyzer range that may be used during a test segment must have the zero and span responses recorded prior to the start of the test. Only the range(s) used to measure the emissions during the test is required to have its zero and span recorded after the completion of the test. Depending on the stability of each individual analyzer, more frequent zero checks or spans between modes may be necessary.</P>
              <P>(3) It is permitted to change filter elements between test segments.</P>
              <P>(4) A leak check is permitted between modes.</P>

              <P>(1) For dilute grab (“bag”) analysis, the analyzer response must be stable at greater than 99 percent of the final reading for the dilute exhaust sample bag. A single value representing the average chart deflection over a 10-second stabilized period shall be stored.</P>
              <P>(2) For continuous analysis systems, a single value representing the average integrated concentration over a cycle shall be stored. Alternatively, the ADC may store the individual instantaneous values collected during the measurement period.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Raw gaseous exhaust sampling and analytical system description.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Schematic drawing. An example of a sampling and analytical system which may be used for testing under this subpart is shown in Figure 4 in appendix B of this subpart. All components or parts of components that are wetted by the sample or corrosive calibration gases shall be either chemically cleaned stainless steel or inert material (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene resin). The use of “gauge savers” or “protectors” with nonreactive diaphragms to reduce dead volumes is permitted.</P>
              <P>(b) Sample probe. (1) The sample probe shall be a straight, closed end, stainless steel, multi-hole probe. The inside diameter shall not be greater than the inside diameter of the sample line + 0.03 cm. The wall thickness of the probe shall not be greater than 0.10 cm. The fitting that attaches the probe to the exhaust pipe shall be as small as practical in order to minimize heat loss from the probe.</P>

              <P>(2) The probe shall have a minimum of three holes. The spacing of the radial planes for each hole in the probe must be such that they cover approximately equal cross-sectional areas of <PRTPAGE P="355"/>the exhaust duct. The angular spacing of the holes must be approximately equal. The angular spacing of any two holes in one plane may not be 180° ±20° (i.e., section C-C of Figure 1 in appendix B of this subpart). The holes should be sized such that each has approximately the same flow. If only three holes are used, they may not all be in the same radial plane.</P>
              <P>(3) The exhaust gas probe must be located in a position which yields a well mixed, homogeneous sample of the engine exhaust. The probe must extend radially through the exhaust duct prior to where the exhaust mixes with the cooling water. The cooling water flow may be rerouted if necessary to obtain an emission sample provided that the modification has no significant effect on the performance or emissions characteristics of the engine. The probe must pass through the approximate center and must extend across at least 80 percent of the diameter of the duct. The exact position of the probe may vary from engine family to engine family.</P>
              <P>(c) Sample transfer line. (1) The maximum inside diameter of the sample line shall not exceed 1.32 cm.</P>
              <P>(2) If valve V2 in Figure 1 of appendix B of Subpart D of this part is used, the sample probe must connect directly to valve V2 in Figure 1 of appendix B of subpart D of this part. The location of optional valve V2 may not be greater than 1.22 m from the exhaust duct.</P>
              <P>(3) The location of optional valve V16 in Figure 1 of appendix B of subpart D of this part may not be greater than 61 cm from the sample pump. The leakage rate for this section on the pressure side of the sample pump may not exceed the leakage rate specification for the vacuum side of the pump.</P>
              <P>(d) Venting. All vents including analyzer vents, bypass flow, and pressure relief vents of regulators should be vented in such a manner to avoid endangering personnel in the immediate area.</P>
              <P>(e) Any variation from the specifications in this subpart including performance specifications and emission detection methods may be used only with prior approval by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(f) Additional components, such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, switches, and so forth, may be employed to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems.</P>
              <P>(g) The following requirements must be incorporated in each system used for raw testing under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) Take the sample for all components with one sample probe and split it internally to the different analyzers.</P>

              <P>(2) Heat the sample transport system from the engine exhaust pipe to the HC analyzer for the raw gas sampling method as indicated in Figure 1 in appendix B of subpart D of this part. The NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer for the raw gas sampling method may be heated as indicated in Figure 1 in appendix B of subpart D of this part. The HC analyzer and the NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer for the dilute sampling method may be heated as indicated in Figure 1 in appendix B of subpart D of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>CVS concept of exhaust gas sampling system.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A dilute exhaust sampling system is designed to directly measure the true mass of emissions in engine exhaust without the necessity of measuring either fuel flow or intake air flow. This is accomplished by diluting the exhaust produced by an engine under test with ambient background air and measuring the total diluted exhaust flow rate and the concentration of emissions within the dilute flow. Total mass flow of an emission is then easily calculated.</P>
              <P>(b) A constant volume sampler (CVS) is typically used to control the total amount of dilute flow through the system. As the name implies, a CVS restricts flow to a known value dependent only on the dilute exhaust temperature and pressure.</P>
              <P>(c) For the testing described in this subpart, a CVS must consist of: A mixing tunnel into which the engine exhaust and dilutant (background) air are dumped; a dilute exhaust flow metering system; a dilute exhaust sample port; a background sample port; a dilute exhaust sampling system; and a background sampling system.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Mixing tunnel.</E> The mixing tunnel must be constructed such that complete mixing of the engine exhaust and background air is assured prior to the sampling probe.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exhaust flow metering system.</E> A dilute exhaust flow metering system must be used to control the total flow <PRTPAGE P="359"/>rate of the dilute engine exhaust as described in § 91.421.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Exhaust sample port.</E> A dilute exhaust sample port must be located in or downstream of the mixing tunnel at a point where complete mixing of the engine exhaust and background air is assured.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Background sample port.</E> A dilute background sample port must be located in the stream of background air before it is mixed with the engine exhaust. The background probe must draw a representative sample of the background air during each sampling mode.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Exhaust sampling system.</E> The dilute exhaust sampling system controls the flow of samples from the mixing tunnel to the analyzer system. This could be either a continuous sampling system or grab (bag) sampling system. If a critical flow venturi (CFV) is used on the dilute exhaust sample probe, this system must assure that the sample CFV is in choke flow during testing.

              <SUBJECT>Dilute gaseous exhaust sampling and analytical system description.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this section is designed to measure the true mass emissions of engine exhaust. This system utilizes the Constant volume Sampling (CVS) concept (described in § 91.420) of measuring mass emissions of HC, NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>. Grab sampling for individual modes is an acceptable method of dilute testing for all constituents, HC, NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>. Continuous dilute sampling is not required for any of the exhaust constituents, but is allowable for all. Heated sampling is not required for any of the constituents, but is allowable for HC and NO<E T="52">X</E>. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement of CO<E T="52">2</E>. General requirements are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) This sampling system requires the use of a Positive Displacement Pump—Constant Volume Sampler (PDP-CVS) system with a heat exchanger, or a Critical Flow Venturi—Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-CVS) system with CVS sample probes and/or a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation. Figure 2 in appendix B of this subpart is a schematic drawing of the PDP-CVS system. Figure 3 in appendix B of this subpart is a schematic drawing of the CFV-CVS system.</P>
              <P>(2) The HC analytical system requires:</P>
              <P>(i) Grab sampling (see § 91.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see § 91.423, and Figure 4 in appendix B of this subpart), or</P>
              <P>(ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted HC meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) The dilute HC analytical system for marine spark-ignition engines does not require a heated flame ionization detector (HFID).</P>
              <P>(iv) If used, the HFID sample must be taken directly from the diluted exhaust stream through a heated probe and integrated continuously over the test cycle.</P>
              <P>(v) The heated probe must be located in the sampling system far enough downstream of the mixing area to ensure a uniform sample distribution across the CVS duct at the sampling zone.</P>
              <P>(3) The CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> analytical system requires:</P>
              <P>(i) Grab sampling (see § 91.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see § 91.423, and Figure 4 in appendix B of this subpart), or</P>

              <P>(ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> meeting <PRTPAGE P="360"/>the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The NO<E T="52">X</E> analytical system requires:</P>
              <P>(i) Grab sampling (see § 91.420, and Figure 2 or Figure 3 in appendix B of this subpart) and analytical capabilities (see § 91.423, and Figure 4 in appendix B of this subpart), or</P>

              <P>(ii) A continuously integrated measurement of diluted NO<E T="52">X</E> meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. Other components, such as snubbers, which are not needed to maintain accuracy on some systems, may be excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(6) Other sampling and/or analytical systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) Component description. The components necessary for exhaust sampling must meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exhaust dilution system.</E> The PDP-CVS must conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas PDP-CVS in § 91.420 of this chapter. The CFV-CVS must conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust gas CFV-CVS in § 91.420. In addition, the CVS must conform to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream in the dilution system at a temperature of 190 °C or less at the sampling zone for hydrocarbon measurement and as required to prevent condensation at any point in the dilution system. Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from this sampling point.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the CFV-CVS, either a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation is required (see Figure 3 in appendix B of this subpart).</P>
              <P>(iii) For the CFV-CVS when a heat exchanger is used, the gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately ahead of the critical flow venturi, must be within ±11 °C of the average operating temperature observed during the test with the simultaneous requirement that condensation does not occur. The temperature measuring system (sensors and readout) must have an accuracy and precision of ±2 °C. For systems utilizing a flow compensator to maintain proportional flow, the requirement for maintaining constant temperature is not necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Continuous HC measurement system.</E> (i) The continuous HC sample system (as shown in Figure 2 or 3 in appendix B of this subpart) uses an “overflow” zero and span system. In this type of system, excess zero or span gas spills out of the probe when zero and span checks of the analyzer are made.</P>
              <P>(ii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC sample probe, line, or system, unless a common sample pump is used for all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good engineering practice.</P>
              <P>(iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line must be at least 105 percent of the sample system flow rate.</P>
              <P>(iv) The overflow gases must enter the sample line as close as practical to the outside surface of the CVS duct or dilution system.</P>
              <P>(v) The continuous HC sampling system consists of a probe (which for a HFID analyzer must raise the sample to the specified temperature) and, where used, a sample transfer system (which for a HFID must maintain the specified temperature). The HFID continuous hydrocarbon sampling system (exclusive of the probe) must:</P>
              <P>(A) Maintain a wall temperature of 190 ±11 °C as measured at every separately controlled heated component (that is, filters, heated line sections), using permanent thermocouples located at each of the separate components.</P>

              <P>(B) Have a wall temperature of 190 ±11 °C over its entire length. The temperature of the system is demonstrated by profiling the thermal characteristics of the system where possible at initial installation and after any major maintenance performed on the system. <PRTPAGE P="361"/>The profiling is to be accomplished using the insertion thermocouple probing technique. The system temperature must be monitored continuously during testing at the locations and temperature described in § 91.421(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(C) Maintain a gas temperature of 190 ±11 °C immediately before the heated filter and HFID. Determine these gas temperatures by a temperature sensor located immediately upstream of each component.</P>
              <P>(vi) The continuous hydrocarbon sampling probe:</P>
              <P>(A) Is defined as the first 25.4 to 76.2 cm of the continuous hydrocarbon sampling system.</P>
              <P>(B) Has a 0.483 cm minimum inside diameter.</P>
              <P>(C) Is installed in the dilution system at a point where the dilution air and exhaust are well mixed and provide a homogenous mixture.</P>
              <P>(D) Is sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the system wall so as to be free from the influence of any wakes or eddies.</P>
              <P>(E) For a continuous HFID sample probe, the probe must increase the gas stream temperature to 190 ±11 °C at the exit of the probe. Demonstrate the ability of the probe to accomplish this using the insertion thermocouple technique at initial installation and after any major maintenance. Demonstrate compliance with the temperature specification by continuously recording during each test the temperature of either the gas stream or the wall of the sample probe at its terminus.</P>
              <P>(vii) The response time of the continuous measurement system must be taken into account when logging test data.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Sample mixing.</E> (i) configure the dilution system to ensure a well mixed, homogeneous sample prior to the sampling probe(s).</P>
              <P>(ii) Make the temperature of the diluted exhaust stream inside the dilution system sufficient to prevent water condensation.</P>
              <P>(iii) Direct the engine exhaust downstream at the point where it is introduced into the dilution system.</P>

                <E T="03">measurement systems.</E> (i) Sample probe requirements:</P>
              <P>(A) The sample probe for continuously integrated NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E> must be in the same plane as the continuous HC probe, but sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the tunnel wall so as to be free from the influences of any wakes or eddies.</P>
              <P>(B) The sample probe for continuously integrated NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E> must be heated and insulated over the entire length, to prevent water condensation, to a minimum temperature of 55 °C. Sample gas temperature immediately before the first filter in the system must be at least 55 °C.</P>
              <P>(ii) Conform to the continuous NO<E T="52">X</E>, CO, or CO<E T="52">2</E> sampling and analysis system to the specifications of 40 CFR 1065.145, with the following exceptions and revisions:</P>
              <P>(A) Heat the system components requiring heating only to prevent water condensation, the minimum component temperature is 55 °C.</P>
              <P>(B) Coordinate analysis system response time with CVS flow fluctuations and sampling time/test cycle offsets to meet the time-alignment and dispersion specifications in 40 CFR pat 1065, subpart C.</P>

              <P>(D) Use a calibration curve conforming to 40 CFR part 1065, subparts C and D, for CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> for any range on a linear analyzer below 155 ppm.</P>
              <P>(iii) Convert the chart deflections or voltage output of analyzers with non-linear calibration curves to concentration values by the calibration curve(s) specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart D, before flow correction (if used) and subsequent integration takes place.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Schematic drawings.</E> Figure 4 in appendix B of this subpart is a schematic drawing of the exhaust gas analytical system used for analyzing CVS grab “bag” samples from spark-ignition engines. Since various configurations can <PRTPAGE P="362"/>produce accurate results, exact conformance with the drawing is not required. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and switches may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems. Other components such as snubbers, which are not needed to maintain accuracy in some systems, may be excluded if their exclusion is based on good engineering judgement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Major component description.</E> The analytical system, Figure 4 in Appendix B of this subpart, consists of a flame ionization detector (FID) or a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) for the measurement of hydrocarbons, nondispersive infrared analyzers (NDIR) for the measurement of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and a chemiluminescence detector (CLD) (or heated CLD (HCLD)) for the measurement of oxides of nitrogen. The exhaust gas analytical system shall conform to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The CLD (or HCLD) requires that the nitrogen dioxide present in the sample be converted to nitric oxide before analysis. Other types of analyzers may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) If CO instruments are used which are essentially free of CO<E T="52">2</E> and water vapor interference, the use of the conditioning column may be deleted. (See §§ 91.317 and 91.320.)</P>

              <P>(3) A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of CO<E T="52">2</E> and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture of three percent CO<E T="52">2</E> in N<E T="52">2</E>, which has been bubbled through water at room temperature, produces an equivalent CO response, as measured on the most sensitive CO range, which is less than one percent of full scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or less than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale.

              <SUBJECT>Dilute sampling procedure—CVS calibration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor valve. (1) The flowmeter calibration shall be traceable to the National Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST), and will serve as the reference value (NIST “true” value) for the CVS calibration.)</P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>In no case should an upstream screen or other restriction which can affect the flow be used ahead of the flowmeter unless calibrated throughout the flow range with such a device.)</P>
              </NOTE>
              <P>(2) The CVS calibration procedures are designed for use of a “metering venturi” type flowmeter. Large radius or American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) flow nozzles are considered equivalent if traceable to NIST measurements. Other measurement systems may be used if shown to be equivalent under the test conditions in this section and traceable to NIST measurements.</P>
              <P>(3) Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are recorded and related to flow through the CVS.</P>
              <P>(4) Procedures used by EPA for both PDP-CVS and CFV-CVS are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of the entire system may be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of the system (e.g., analyzer calibration, leaks, or HC hangup). A verification procedure is found in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PDP-CVS calibration.</E> (1) The following calibration procedure outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the CVS pump.</P>

              <P>(i) All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump.<PRTPAGE P="363"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The calculated flow rate, in cm<SU>3</SU>/s, (at pump inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of pump parameters.</P>
              <P>(iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is then determined.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range used must be performed.</P>
              <P>(2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Two conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve:</P>
              <P>(i) The temperature stability must be maintained during calibration. (Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations; this can cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes in temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes.)</P>
              <P>(ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of leakage.</P>
              <P>(3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the calibration equation.</P>
              <P>(4) Connect a system as shown in Figure 5 in appendix B of this subpart. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the system indicated, the following measurements and accuracies are required:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Catalyst thermal stress resistance evaluation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The purpose of the evaluation procedure specified in this section is to determine the effect of thermal stress on catalyst conversion efficiency. The thermal stress is imposed on the test catalyst by exposing it to quiescent heated air in an oven. The evaluation of the effect of such stress on catalyst performance is based on the resultant degradation of the efficiency with which the conversions of specific pollutants are promoted. The application of this evaluation procedure involves the several steps that are described in the following paragraphs.</P>
              <P>(2) The engine manufacturer need not submit catalyst conversion efficiency data for pollutants that the catalyst being tested was not designed to reduce/oxidize. The engine manufacturer must specify the pollutants that the catalyst will be converting and submit catalyst conversion efficiency data on only those pollutants.</P>
              <P>(b) Determination of initial conversion efficiency.</P>
              <P>(1) A synthetic exhaust gas mixture having the composition specified in § 91.329 is heated to a temperature of 450 ±5 °C and passed through the new test catalyst or, optionally, a test catalyst that has been exposed to temperatures less than or equal to 500 °C for less than or equal to two hours, under flow conditions that are representative of anticipated in-use conditions.</P>
              <P>(2) The concentration of each pollutant of interest, that is, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, or oxides of nitrogen, in the effluent of the catalyst is determined by means of the instrumentation that is specified for exhaust gas analysis in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) The conversion efficiency for each pollutant is determined by:</P>
              <P>(i) Subtracting the effluent concentration from the initial concentration,</P>
              <P>(ii) Dividing this result by the initial concentration,</P>
              <P>(iii) Multiplying this result by 100 percent.</P>
              <P>(c) Imposition of thermal stress.</P>
              <P>(1) The catalyst is placed in an oven that has been pre-heated to 1000 °C and the temperature of the air in the oven is maintained at 1000 ±10 °C for six hours. Optionally, the catalyst may instead be placed in an oven having a 90% nitrogen/10% water vapor environment that has been pre-heated to at least 850 °C and the temperature of the nitrogen/water vapor environment in the oven is maintained at 850 °C ±10 °C for six hours.</P>
              <P>(2) The catalyst is removed from the oven and allowed to cool to room temperature.</P>
              <P>(d) Determination of final conversion efficiency. The steps listen in paragraph (b) of this section are repeated.</P>
              <P>(e) Determination of conversion efficiency degradation.</P>
              <P>(1) The final conversion efficiency determined in paragraph (c) of this section is subtracted from the initial conversion efficiency determined in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) This result is divided by the initial conversion efficiency.</P>
              <P>(3) This result is multiplied by 100 percent.</P>

              <P>(f) Determination of compliance with degradation limit. The percent degradation determined in paragraph (e) of <PRTPAGE P="368"/>this section must not be greater than 20 percent.</P>

              <P>(4) After each new test, the required sample size, N, is recalculated using updated sample means, sample standard deviations and the appropriate 95% confidence coefficient.</P>
              <P>(5) A manufacturer must continue testing and updating each engine family's sample size calculations according to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section until a decision is made to stop testing as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section or a noncompliance decision is made pursuant to § 91.510(b).</P>

              <P>(7) If, at any time throughout the model year, the sample mean, x, for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> is greater than the FEL, the manufacturer must continue testing that engine family at the appropriate maximum sampling rate.</P>
              <P>(8) The maximum required sample size for an engine family (regardless of the required sample size, N, as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is the lesser of thirty tests per model year or one percent of projected annual production for that engine family for that model year.</P>
              <P>(9) Manufacturers may elect to test additional randomly chosen engines. All additional randomly chosen engines tested in accordance with the testing procedures specified in § 91.507 must be included in the Sample Size and Cumulative Sum equation calculations as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and § 91.508(a), respectively.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) For marine SI engines subject to the provisions of this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are specified in subpart E of this part.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a <PRTPAGE P="380"/>manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other than those specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any marine engine he or she determines is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify any test engine and may not perform any emission test on any test engine unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification and/or test is documented in the manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and is actually performed by the manufacturer or unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification and/or test is required or permitted under this subpart or is approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may adjust or require to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification, production line testing and Selective Enforcement Audit testing, to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator, prior to the performance of any test. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator may not adjust it or require that it be adjusted to any setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 12 hours of service on the engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply information necessary to establish an alternate minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance characteristics and information from similar in-use engines.</P>
              <P>(c) Service accumulation. (1) Prior to performing exhaust emission production line testing, the manufacturer may accumulate on each test engine a number of hours of service equal to the greater of 12 hours or the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission data engine for each engine family.</P>
              <P>(2) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of production line engines.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on test engines after selection for testing.</P>
              <P>(e) If an engine is shipped to a remote facility for production line testing, and an adjustment or repair is necessary because of shipment, the engine manufacturer must perform the necessary adjustment or repair only after the initial test of the engine, except in cases where the Administrator has determined that the test would be impossible or unsafe to perform or would permanently damage the engine. Engine manufacturers must report to the Administrator, in the quarterly report required by § 91.509(e), all adjustments or repairs performed on test engines prior to each test.</P>
              <P>(f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Testing.</E> A manufacturer must test engines with the test procedure specified in subpart E of this part to demonstrate compliance with the applicable FEL. If alternate procedures were used in certification, then those alternate procedures must be used in production line testing.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Retesting.</E> (1) If an engine manufacturer reasonably determines that an emission test of an engine is invalid, the engine may be retested. Emission results from all tests must be reported to EPA. The engine manufacturer must also include a detailed explanation of the reasons for invalidating any test in the quarterly report required in <PRTPAGE P="381"/>§ 91.509(e). In the event a retest is performed, a request may be made to the Administrator, within ten days of the end of the production quarter, for permission to substitute the after-repair test results for the original test results. The Administrator will either affirm or deny the request by the engine manufacturer within ten working days from receipt of the request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The certificate of conformity is automatically suspended with respect to any engine failing pursuant to paragraph (a) of § 91.510 effective from the time that testing of that engine is completed.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for an engine family which is determined to be in noncompliance pursuant to § 90.510(b). This suspension will not occur before fifteen days after the engine family is determined to be in noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(c) If the results of testing pursuant to these regulations indicate that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding the fact that engines described in the application for certification may be covered by a certificate of conformity, the Administrator may suspend such certificate immediately in whole or in part if the Administrator finds any one of the following infractions to be substantial:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer refuses to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) An EPA enforcement officer is denied the opportunity to conduct activities authorized in this subpart and a warrant or court order is presented to the manufacturer or the party in charge of the facility in question.</P>
              <P>(5) An EPA enforcement officer is unable to conduct activities authorized in § 91.505 because a manufacturer has located its facility in a foreign jurisdiction where local law prohibits those activities.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in part. A suspension or revocation is effective upon receipt of the notification or fifteen days from the time an engine family is determined to be in noncompliance pursuant to § 91.510(b), whichever is later, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for an engine family after the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the proposed remedy for the nonconformity, as reported by the manufacturer to the Administrator, is one requiring a design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as described in the application for certification of the affected engine family.</P>
              <P>(g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine:</P>
              <P>(1) Remedy the nonconformity;<PRTPAGE P="384"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine conforms to the Family Emission Limit by retesting the engine in accordance with these regulations; and</P>
              <P>(3) Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other information that may be required by this part.</P>
              <P>(h) Once a certificate for a failed engine family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate:</P>
              <P>(1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies will be implemented.</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with the regulations of this part by testing as many engines as needed so that the CumSum statistic, as calculated in § 91.508(a), falls below the action limit. Such testing must comply with the provisions of this part. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for any engine actually determined to be in conformance with the Family Emission Limits through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Once the certificate has been revoked for an engine family, if the manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before the Administrator may issue a certificate for that modified family:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to evaluate the proposed change or changes or whether additional testing will be required; and</P>
              <P>(2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the modified engine family does in fact conform with the regulations of this part by testing as many engines as needed from the modified engine family so that the CumSum statistic, as calculated in § 91.508(a) using the newly assigned FEL if applicable, falls below the action limit. When both of these requirements are met, the Administrator shall reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family. As long as the CumSum statistic remains above the action limit, the revocation remains in effect.</P>
              <P>(j) At any time subsequent to a suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than 15 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.</P>
              <P>(k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraph (d) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Shall be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with §§ 91.512, 91.513, and 91.514 and</P>
              <P>(2) Need not apply to engines no longer in the possession of the manufacturer.</P>

              <P>(l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section and prior to the commencement of a hearing under <PRTPAGE P="385"/>§ 91.512, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend or revoke the certificate was based on erroneous information, the Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.</P>
              <P>(m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines while conducting subsequent testing of the noncomplying family, a manufacturer may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the following condition: the manufacturer must commit to recall all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the CumSum statistic does not fall below the action limit and must commit to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.</P>

              <P>(a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to § 91.511(a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer's request shall be filed with the Administrator not later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of his or her decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer shall simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Manager of the Engine Compliance Programs Group and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk for the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his or her discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.</P>

              <P>(2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing requested under § 91.511(j), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether tests have been properly conducted (specifically, whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning);</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether sampling plans and statistical analyses have been properly applied (specifically, whether sampling procedures and statistical analyses specified in this subpart were followed and whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines produced at plants other than the one from which engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's decision under § 91.511(c));</P>
              <P>(3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 91.604</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Test orders.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A test order addressed to the manufacturer is required for any testing under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) The test order is signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or his or her designee. The test order must be delivered in person by an EPA enforcement officer or EPA authorized representative to a company representative or sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the manufacturer's representative who signed the application for certification submitted by the manufacturer, pursuant to the requirements of the applicable section of subpart B of this part. Upon receipt of a test order, the manufacturer must comply with all of the provisions of this subpart and instructions in the test order.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Information included in test order.</E> (1) The test order will specify the engine family to be selected for testing, the manufacturer's engine assembly plant or associated storage facility or port facility (for imported engines) from which the engines must be selected, the time and location at which engines must be selected, and the procedure by which engines of the specified family must be selected. The test order may specify the configuration to be audited and/or the number of engines to be selected per day. Engine manufacturers are required to select a minimum of four engines per day unless an alternate selection procedure is approved pursuant to § 91.606(a), or unless total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If total production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per day, the manufacturer selects the actual number of engines produced per day.</P>
              <P>(2) The test order may include alternate families to be selected for testing at the Administrator's discretion in the event that engines of the specified family are not available for testing because those engines are not being manufactured during the specified time or are not being stored at the specified assembly plant, associated storage facilities, or port of entry.</P>
              <P>(3) If the specified family is not being manufactured at a rate of at least two engines per day in the case of manufacturers specified in 40 CFR 89.607(g)(1), or one engine per day in the case of manufacturers specified in 40 CFR 89.607(g)(2), over the expected duration of the audit, the Assistant Administrator or her or his designated representative may select engines of the alternate family for testing.</P>
              <P>(4) In addition, the test order may include other directions or information essential to the administration of the required testing.</P>
              <P>(d) A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families and the corresponding assembly plants, associated storage facilities, or (in the case of imported engines) port facilities from which the manufacturer prefers to have engines selected for testing in response to a test order. In order that a manufacturer's preferred location be considered for inclusion in a test order for a particular engine family, the list must be submitted prior to issuance of the test order. Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has submitted the list, the Administrator may order selection at other than a preferred location.</P>
              <P>(e) Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer must proceed in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 91.605</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Testing by the Administrator.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Administrator may require by test order under § 91.604 that engines of a specified family be selected in a manner consistent with the requirements of § 91.606 and submitted to the Administrator at the place designated for the purpose of conducting emission tests. These tests will be conducted in accordance with § 91.607 to determine whether engines manufactured by the manufacturer conform with the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designating official data.</E> (1) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test engine or the Administrator and manufacturer each conduct a test on the same test engine, the results of the Administrator's test comprise the official data for that engine.</P>

              <P>(2) Whenever the manufacturer conducts all tests on a test engine, the manufacturer's test data is accepted as the official data, provided that if the <PRTPAGE P="389"/>Administrator makes a determination based on testing conducted under paragraph (a) of this section that there is a substantial lack of agreement between the manufacturer's test results and the Administrator's test results, no manufacturer's test data from the manufacturer's test facility will be accepted for purposes of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) If testing conducted under § 91.604 is unacceptable under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Administrator must:</P>
              <P>(1) Notify the manufacturer in writing of the Administrator's determination that the test facility is inappropriate for conducting the tests required by this subpart and the reasons therefor; and</P>
              <P>(2) Reinstate any manufacturer's data upon a showing by the manufacturer that the data acquired under § 91.604 was erroneous and the manufacturer's data was correct.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer may request in writing that the Administrator reconsider the determination in paragraph (b)(2) of this section based on data or information which indicates that changes have been made to the test facility and these changes have resolved the reasons for disqualification.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 91.606</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Sample selection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Engines comprising a test sample will be selected at the location and in the manner specified in the test order. If a manufacturer determines that the test engines cannot be selected in the manner specified in the test order, an alternative selection procedure may be employed, provided the manufacturer requests approval of the alternative procedure prior to the start of test sample selection, and the Administrator approves the procedure.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer must produce and assemble the test engines of the family selected for testing using its normal production and assembly process for engines to be distributed into commerce. If, between the time the manufacturer is notified of a test order and the time the manufacturer finishes selecting test engines, the manufacturer implements any change(s) in its production or assembly processes, including quality control, which may reasonably be expected to affect the emissions of the engines selected, then the manufacturer must, during the audit, inform the Administrator of such changes. If the test engines are selected at a location where they do not have their operational and emission control systems installed, the test order will specify the manner and location for selection of components to complete assembly of the engines. The manufacturer must assemble these components onto the test engines using normal assembly and quality control procedures as documented by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used on the test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the production and assembly of all other engines of that family, unless the Administrator approves the modification in production or assembly procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The test order may specify that an EPA enforcement officer(s) or authorized representative(s), rather than the manufacturer, select the test engines according to the method specified in the test order.</P>
              <P>(e) The order in which test engines are selected determines the order in which test results are to be used in applying the sampling plan in accordance with § 91.608.</P>
              <P>(f) The manufacturer must keep on hand all untested engines, if any, comprising the test sample until a pass or fail decision is reached in accordance with § 91.608(e). The manufacturer may ship any tested engine which has not failed the requirements as set forth in § 91.608(b). However, once the manufacturer ships any test engine, it relinquishes the prerogative to conduct retests as provided in § 91.607(i).</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 91.607</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Test procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) For marine SI engines subject to the provisions of this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are the test procedures as specified in subpart E of this part.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other than those specified in <PRTPAGE P="390"/>paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any marine engine he or she determines is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify the engines selected for testing and may not perform any emission tests on engines selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are documented in the manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification and Selective Enforcement Audit testing in accordance with § 91.112, to any setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with § 91.112, prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator may not adjust it to any setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 12 hours of service on the engine under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emission performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use engines. In determining likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine performance characteristics and information from similar in-use engines.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Service accumulation.</E> Prior to performing exhaust emission testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service equal to the greater of 12 hours or the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission data engine corresponding to the family specified in the test order.</P>
              <P>(1) Service accumulation must be performed in a manner using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of normal production engines. This service accumulation must be consistent with the new engine break-in instructions contained in the applicable owner's manual.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer must accumulate service at a minimum rate of 6 hours per engine during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(i) The first 24-hour period for service begins as soon as authorized checks, inspections, and preparations are completed on each engine.</P>
              <P>(ii) The minimum service accumulation rate does not apply on weekends or holidays.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the manufacturer's service or target is less than the minimum rate specified (6 hours per day), then the minimum daily accumulation rate is equal to the manufacturer's service target.</P>
              <P>(3) Service accumulation must be completed on a sufficient number of test engines during consecutive 24-hour periods to assure that the number of engines tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on test engines after selection for testing, nor may the Administrator allow deletion of any engine from the test sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator before any engine maintenance or deletion.</P>

              <P>(e) The manufacturer must expeditiously ship test engines from the point of selection to the test facility. If the test facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point of selection, the manufacturer must assure that test engines arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection. The <PRTPAGE P="391"/>Administrator may approve more time for shipment based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</P>
              <P>(f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence.</P>
              <P>(g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer must notify the Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order as to which test facility will be used to comply with the test order. If no test cells are available at a desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(1) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the United States market for the applicable year of 7,500 or greater must complete emission testing at a minimum rate of two engines per 24-hour period, including each voided test and each smoke test.</P>
              <P>(2) A manufacturer with projected nonroad engine sales for the United States market for the applicable year of less than 7,500 must complete emission testing at a minimum rate of one engine per 24-hour period, including each voided test and each smoke test.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator may approve a lower daily rate of emission testing based upon a request by a manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</P>
              <P>(h) The manufacturer must perform test engine selection, shipping, preparation, service accumulation, and testing in such a manner as to assure that the audit is performed in an expeditious manner.</P>
              <P>(i) Retesting. (1) The manufacturer may retest any engines tested during a Selective Enforcement Audit once a fail decision for the audit has been reached in accordance with § 91.608(e).</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may approve retesting at other times based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.</P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer may retest each engine a total of three times. The manufacturer must test each engine or vehicle the same number of times. The manufacturer may accumulate additional service before conducting a retest, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(j) A manufacturer must test engines with the test procedure specified in subpart E of this part to demonstrate compliance with the exhaust emission standard (or applicable FEL) for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E>. If alternate procedures were used in certification pursuant to § 91.119, then those alternate procedures must be used.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 91.608</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and failing criteria for selective enforcement audits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.</P>

              <P>(b) A failed engine is one whose final test results pursuant to § 91.509(b), for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E>. exceed the applicable family emission level.</P>

              <P>(c) The manufacturer must test engines comprising the test sample until a pass decision is reached for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> or a fail decision is reached for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E>. A pass decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> is less than or equal to the pass decision number, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the cumulative number of engines tested. A fail decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed engines for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> is greater than or equal to the fail decision number, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, appropriate to the cumulative number of engines tested.</P>

              <P>(d) The pass and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of engines tested are determined by using the tables in Appendix A to this subpart, “Sampling Plans for Selective Enforcement Auditing of Marine Engines,” appropriate to the projected sales as made by the manufacturer in its report to EPA under § 91.504(c)(1). In the tables in Appendix A to this subpart, sampling plan “stage” refers to the cumulative number of engines tested. Once a pass or fail decision has been made for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E>. the number of engines with final test results exceeding the emission <PRTPAGE P="392"/>standard for HC + NO<E T="52">X</E> shall not be considered any further for the purposes of the audit.</P>
              <P>(e) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision is made on the last engine required to make a decision under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

Conditional admission must be under bond. The Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request for approval from the Administrator must contain the identification required in § 91.703(b) and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption. Noncompliance with provisions of this section may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond or exportation of <PRTPAGE P="395"/>the marine engine. The following temporary exemptions are permitted by this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exemption for repairs or alterations.</E> Upon written approval by EPA, a person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming marine SI engine solely for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). The marine SI engines may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of repair or alteration. It may not be sold or leased in the United States and must be exported upon completion of the repair(s) or alteration(s).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Testing exemption.</E> A nonconforming test marine SI engine may be conditionally imported under bond by a person subject to the requirements of § 91.1005. A test marine SI engine may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a request is made by the appropriate importer, and subsequently granted by EPA, concerning the marine engine in accordance with § 91.1005(f) for a subsequent one-year period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Display exemptions.</E> (i) A nonconforming marine engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported under bond subject to the requirements of § 91.1007.</P>
              <P>(ii) A display marine engine may be imported by any person for purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, display of a marine engine at a dealership, private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for display exemptions. A display marine engine may not be sold or leased in the United States and may not be operated in the United States except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</P>
              <P>(iii) A temporary display exemption is granted for 12 months or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Extensions of up to 12 months each are available upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption exceed 36 months.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, a marine SI engine may be finally admitted into the United States under this paragraph if prior written approval for such final admission is obtained from the Administrator. A request for approval is to contain the identification information required in § 91.703(b) (except for § 91.703(b)(5)) and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption. The following exemptions are permitted by this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">National security exemption.</E> A nonconforming marine engine may be imported under the national security exemption found at § 91.1008.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exemption for marine engines identical to United States certified versions.</E> (i) Any person (including businesses) is eligible for importing a nonconforming marine SI engine into the United States under the provisions of this paragraph. An exemption will be granted if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the marine engine:</P>
              <P>(A) Is owned by the importer;</P>
              <P>(B) Is not offered for importation for the purpose of resale; and</P>
              <P>(C) Is proven to be identical, in all material respects, to a marine SI engine of the same or later model year certified by the Original Engine Manufacturer for sale in the United States or is proven to have been modified to be identical, in all material respects, to a marine engine of the same or later model year certified by the OEM for sale in the United States according to complete written instructions provided by the OEM's United States representative, or his/her designee.</P>
              <P>(ii) Proof of conformity.</P>
              <P>(A) Documentation submitted pursuant to this section for the purpose of proving conformity of individual marine engines is to contain sufficiently organized data or evidence demonstrating that the marine engine identified pursuant to § 91.703(b) is identical, in all material respects, to a marine engine identified in an OEM's application for certification.</P>

              <P>(B) If the documentation does not contain all the information required by this part, or is not sufficiently organized, EPA will notify the importer of <PRTPAGE P="396"/>any areas of inadequacy and that the documentation will not receive further consideration until the required information or organization is provided.</P>
              <P>(C) If EPA determines that the documentation does not clearly or sufficiently demonstrate that a marine engine is eligible for importation under this paragraph, EPA will notify the importer in writing.</P>
              <P>(D) If EPA determines that the documentation clearly and sufficiently demonstrates that a marine engine is eligible for importation under this paragraph, EPA will grant approval for final admission in writing.</P>
              <P>(d) Foreign diplomatic and military personnel may conditionally import a nonconforming marine engine without bond. At the time of conditional admission, the importer must submit to the Administrator the written report required in § 91.703(b) (except for information required by § 91.703(b)(5)) and a statement from the U.S. Department of State confirming qualification for this exemption. Foreign military personnel may, in lieu of a statement from the U.S. Department of State, submit to the Administrator a copy of their orders for duty in the United States. The marine SI engine may not be sold or leased in the United States and must be exported if the individual's diplomatic status or the foreign military orders for duty in the U.S. are no longer applicable, as determined by the Department of State, unless subsequently brought into conformity with U.S. emission requirements in accordance with § 91.704(c)(2).</P>
              <P>(e) Competition exclusion. A nonconforming marine engine may be conditionally imported by any person provided the importer demonstrates to the Administrator that the marine engine is used to propel a marine vessel used solely for competition and obtains prior written approval from the Administrator. A nonconforming engine imported pursuant to this paragraph may not be operated in the United States except for that operation incident and necessary for the competition purpose, unless subsequently brought into conformity with United States emission requirements in accordance with § 91.704(c)(2).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Manufacturer in-use testing program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) EPA shall annually identify engine families and those configurations within families which the manufacturers must then subject to in-use testing. For each model year, EPA may identify the following number of engine families for testing, based on the number of the manufacturer's engine families to which this subpart is applicable produced in that model year:</P>

              <P>(1) For manufactures with three or fewer engine families, EPA may identify a single engine family.<PRTPAGE P="398"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) For manufacturers with four or more engine families, EPA may identify a number of engine families that is no greater than twenty-five percent of the number of engine families to which this subpart is applicable that are produced by the manufacturer in that model year.</P>
              <P>(b) For each engine family identified by EPA, engine manufacturers shall perform emission testing of an appropriate sample of in-use engines from each engine family. Manufacturers shall submit data from this in-use testing to EPA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Number of engines to be tested.</E> An engine manufacturer shall test in-use engines from each engine family identified by EPA. Engines to be tested shall have accumulated between half and three-quarters of the family's useful life. The number of engines to be tested by a manufacturer will be determined by the following method:</P>
              <P>(1) A minimum of four (4) engines per family provided that no engine fails any standard. For each failing engine, two more engines shall be tested until the total number of engines equals ten (10).</P>
              <P>(2) For engine families of less than 500 engines for the identified model year or for engine manufacturers who make less than or equal to 2,000 for that model year, a minimum of two (2) engines per family provided that no engine fails any standard. For each failing engine, two more engines shall be tested until the total number of engines equals ten (10).</P>
              <P>(3) If an engine family was certified using carry over emission data and has been previously tested under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section (and EPA has not ordered a recall for that family), then only one engine for that family must be tested. If that one engine fails any pollutant, testing must be conducted as outlined at paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, whichever is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) At the discretion of the Administrator, an engine manufacturer may test more engines than the minima described in paragraph (c) of this section or may concede failure before testing a total of ten (10) engines.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator will consider failure rates, average emission levels and the existence of any defects among other factors in determining whether to pursue remedial action under this subpart. The Administrator may order a recall pursuant to §§ 91.807-91.814 before testing reaches the tenth engine.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may approve an alternative to manufacturer in-use testing, where:</P>
              <P>(1) Engine family production is less than or equal to 200 per year; or</P>
              <P>(2) Engines cannot be obtained for testing because they are used substantially in craft which are not conducive to engine removal such as large vessels where the engine can not be removed without dismantling either the engine or the vessel; or</P>
              <P>(3) Other compelling circumstances associated with the structure of the industry and uniqueness of marine engine applications. Such alternatives shall be designed to determine whether the engine family is in compliance in-use.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Collection of in-use engines.</E> The engine manufacturer shall procure in-use engines which have been operated for between half and three-quarters of the engine's useful life. The engine manufacturer may test engines from more than one model year in a given year. The manufacturer shall begin testing within twelve calendar months after receiving notice that EPA has identified a particular engine family for testing and shall complete testing of such engine family within twelve calendar months from the start of such testing. Test engines may be procured from sources associated with the engine manufacturer (i.e., manufacturer established fleet engines, etc.) or from sources not associated with the manufacturer (i.e., consumer-owned engines, independently-owned fleet engines, etc.).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Testing exemption.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any person requesting a testing exemption must demonstrate the following:</P>
              <P>(1) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance with § 91.1104(b);</P>
              <P>(2) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption;</P>
              <P>(3) That the proposed test program is reasonable in scope; and</P>
              <P>(4) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of control consonant with the purpose of the program and the EPA's monitoring requirements.</P>
              <P>(5) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each of the four identified elements.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item of information.</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under § 91.1103. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.</P>
              <P>(d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) An estimate of the program's duration.</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum number of marine engines involved.</P>
              <P>(e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) The technical nature of the test;</P>
              <P>(2) The site of the test;</P>
              <P>(3) The duration and accumulated engine operation associated with the test;</P>
              <P>(4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in the test;</P>
              <P>(5) The intended final disposition of the engines;</P>
              <P>(6) The manner in which the engine identification numbers will be identified, recorded, and made available; and</P>
              <P>(7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.</P>
              <P>(f) A manufacturer of new marine SI engines may request a testing exemption to cover marine SI engines intended for use in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent one-year period. Unless otherwise required by the Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the recordkeeping and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes consistent with section 91.1104(b).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Granting of exemptions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made pursuant to § 91.1005 or § 91.1008, EPA determines <PRTPAGE P="404"/>it is appropriate to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption will be prepared and submitted to the person requesting the exemption. The memorandum shall set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and such terms and conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and conditions shall generally include, but are not limited to, agreements by the applicant to conduct the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, create and maintain adequate records accessible to EPA at reasonable times, employ labels for the exempt engines setting forth the nature of the exemption, take appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the exemption are met, and advise EPA of the termination of the activity and the ultimate disposition of the engines.</P>

              <P>(b) Any exemption granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is deemed to cover any subject engine only to the extent that the specified terms and conditions are complied with. A breach of any term or condition causes the exemption to be void <E T="03">ab initio</E> with respect to any engine. Consequently, the causing or the performing of an act prohibited under § 91.1103(a) (1) or (3), other than in strict conformity with all terms and conditions of this exemption renders the person to whom the exemption is granted, and any other person to whom the provisions of § 91.1103 are applicable, liable under sections 204 and 205 of the Act.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Violations.</E> A violation of the requirements of this subpart is a violation of the applicable provisions of the Act, including sections 203 and 213(d), and is subject to the penalty provisions thereunder.</P>
              <P>(1) A person who violates § 91.1103 (a)(1), (a)(4), or (a)(5), or a manufacturer or dealer who violates § 91.1103(a)(3)(i), is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $32,500 for each violation.</P>
              <P>(2) A person other than a manufacturer or dealer who violates § 91.1103(a)(3)(i) or any person who violates § 91.1103(a)(3)(ii) is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $2,750 for each violation.</P>
              <P>(3) A violation with respect to § 91.1103 (a)(1), (a)(3)(i), (a)(4), or (a)(5) constitutes a separate offense with respect to each marine SI engine.</P>
              <P>(4) A violation with respect to § 91.1103(a)(3)(ii) constitutes a separate offense with respect to each part or component. Each day of a violation with respect to § 91.1103(a)(6) constitutes a separate offense.</P>
              <P>(5) A person who violates § 91.1103 (a)(2) or (a)(6) is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $32,500 per day of violation.</P>
              <P>(6) The maximum penalty values listed in this section are shown for calendar year 2004. Maximum penalty limits for later years may be adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index. The specific regulatory provisions for changing the maximum penalties, published in 40 CFR part 19, reference the applicable U.S. Code citation on which the prohibited action is based.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Civil actions.</E> The Administrator may commence a civil action to assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) An action under this paragraph may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or in which the defendant resides or has the Administrator's principal place of business, and the court shall have jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty.</P>

              <P>(2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under this paragraph, the court is to take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.<PRTPAGE P="408"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative assessment of certain penalties</E>—(1) Administrative penalty authority. In lieu of commencing a civil action under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator shall assess any civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty assessment proceeding can not exceed $270,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty is made by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions, any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determining amount.</E> In determining the amount of any civil penalty assessed under this subsection, the Administrator is to take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of administrator's action.</E> (i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph does not affect or limit the Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of this part; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this part, or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this part may not be the subject of a civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) No action by the Administrator under this part affects a person's obligation to comply with a section of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Finality of order.</E> An order issued under this subsection is to become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> (i) A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this subsection may seek review of the assessment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principle place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. The person must simultaneously send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator must file in the court within 30 days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Collection.</E> (i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator is to request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount <PRTPAGE P="409"/>assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the date of the final order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty is not subject to review.</P>
              <P>(ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section is required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to 10 percent of the aggregate amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.</P>

              <P>(a) The in-use credit program for eligible marine engines is described in this subpart. Participation in this program is voluntary.</P>
              <P>(b) A marine SI engine family is eligible to participate in the in-use credit program if it is subject to regulation under subpart B of this part with certain exceptions specified in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) Marine SI engines may not participate in the in-use averaging, banking, and trading program if they are delivered to a “point of first retail sale” outside of the U.S., as defined in § 91.202.</P>
              <P>(d) Credits generated and used in the marine engine certification averaging, banking, and trading program pursuant to the provisions of subpart C of this part are not interchangeable with credits generated and used in the marine engine in-use credit program.</P>
              <P>(e) An engine family with a compliance level, as determined by in-use testing pursuant to subpart I of this part and paragraph (h) of this section, below the applicable FEL to which the engine family is certified may generate emission credits for averaging, banking, or trading in the in-use credit program.</P>
              <P>(f) Positive credits generated in a given model year may be used in that model year and/or in any subsequent model year.</P>
              <P>(g) A manufacturer of an engine family with a compliance level exceeding the applicable FEL to which the engine family is certified, may, prior to the date of the report required under paragraph (j) of this section use previously banked credits, purchase credits from another manufacturer, or perform additional testing pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section to address (as calculated elsewhere in this subpart) the associated credit deficit (negative credits or a need for credits).</P>
              <P>(h) A manufacturer may carry-over an in-use credit deficit up to and including model year 2003. Beginning with model year 2004, all manufacturers must have a zero or positive credit balance.</P>
              <P>(i) A manufacturer must notify EPA of plans to test additional engine families beyond the maximum 25 percent required in subpart I of this part for the in-use testing program. Such notice must be submitted 30 days prior to initiation of service accumulation. EPA may approve, with adequate justification, the use of an existing fleet for additional testing. If the additional testing discovers an engine family to be in noncompliance with the applicable FEL, the testing must be treated as if it were a failure of the normal in-use testing requirement of an engine family.</P>
              <P>(j) Manufacturers must demonstrate a zero or positive credit balance under the in-use credit program for a particular model year within 90 days of the end of the in-use testing of that model year's engine families, or at the same time as the final certification AB&amp;T report (required under § 91.210), whichever is later.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 92.6</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Regulatory structure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This section provides an overview of the regulatory structure of this part.</P>
              <P>(a) The regulations of this part 92 are intended to control emissions from in-use locomotives. Because locomotive chassis and locomotive engines are sometimes manufactured or remanufactured separately, the regulations in this part include some provisions that apply specifically to locomotive engines. However, the use of the term “locomotive engine” in the regulations in this part does not limit in any manner the liability of any manufacturer or remanufacturer for the emission performance of a locomotive powered by an engine that it has manufactured or remanufactured.</P>

              <P>(b) The locomotives and locomotive engines for which the regulations of this part (i.e., 40 CFR part 92) apply are specified by § 92.1, and by the definitions of § 92.2. The point at which a locomotive or locomotive engine becomes subject to the regulations of this part is determined by the definition of “new locomotive or new locomotive engine” in § 92.2. Subpart J of this part contains provisions exempting certain locomotives or locomotive engines from the regulations in this part under special circumstances.<PRTPAGE P="426"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) To comply with the requirements of this part, a manufacturer or remanufacturer must demonstrate to EPA that the locomotive or locomotive engine meets the applicable standards of §§ 92.7 and 92.8, and all other requirements of this part. The requirements of this certification process are described in subparts C and D of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) Subpart B of this part specifies procedures and equipment to be used for conducting emission tests for the purpose of the regulations of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Subparts E, F, G, and H of this part specify requirements for manufacturers and remanufacturers after certification; that is during production and use of the locomotives and locomotive engines.</P>
              <P>(f) Subpart I of this part contains requirements applicable to the importation of locomotives and locomotive engines.</P>
              <P>(g) Subpart K of this part contains requirements applicable to the owners and operators of locomotives and locomotive engines.</P>
              <P>(h) Subpart L of this part describes prohibited acts and contains other enforcement provisions relating to locomotives and locomotive engines.</P>
              <P>(i) Unless specified otherwise, the provisions of this part apply to all locomotives and locomotive engines subject to the emission standards of this part.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 92.7</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>General standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Locomotives and locomotive engines may not be equipped with defeat devices.</P>
              <P>(b) New locomotives fueled with a volatile fuel shall be designed to minimize evaporative emissions during normal operation, including periods when the engine is shut down.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Locomotive hardware for refueling locomotives fueled with a volatile fuel shall be designed so as to minimize the escape of fuel vapors.</P>
              <P>(2) Hoses used to refuel gaseous-fueled locomotives shall not be designed to be bled or vented to the atmosphere under normal operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(3) No valves or pressure relief vents shall be used on gaseous-fueled locomotives except as emergency safety devices, and these shall not operate at normal system operating flows and pressures.</P>
              <P>(d) All new locomotives and new locomotive engines subject to any of the standards imposed by this subpart shall, prior to sale, introduction into service, or return to service, be designed to include features that compensate for changes in altitude to ensure that the locomotives or locomotive engines will comply with the applicable emission standards when operated at any altitude less than 7000 feet above sea level.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 92.8</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Emission standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Exhaust standards.</E> Exhaust emissions from locomotives and locomotive engines, when measured in accordance with the provisions of Subpart B of this part, shall comply with both the applicable line-haul duty-cycle standards, and the applicable switch duty-cycle standards of paragraph (a)(1) (and/or the standards of paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, as applicable) of this section, and the smoke standards of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Emissions that do not exceed the standards comply with the standards.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Gaseous and particulate standards.</E> Gaseous and particulate emission standards are expressed as gram per brake horsepower hour (g/bhp-hr). Non-methane hydrocarbon standards apply to locomotives and locomotive engines fueled with natural gas, and any combination of natural gas and other fuels where natural gas is the primary fuel; total hydrocarbon equivalent standards apply to locomotives and locomotive engines fueled with an alcohol, and any combination of alcohol and other fuels where alcohol is the primary fuel. Total hydrocarbon standards apply to all other locomotives and locomotive engines; that is, those not fueled by natural gas or alcohol. The line-haul duty-cycle standards and switch duty-cycle standards apply to the respective cycle-weighted emission rates as calculated in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Tier 0.</E> The following locomotives (and the engines used in the following locomotives) are subject to the Tier 0 emission standards listed in table A8-1 of this section: Locomotives manufactured on, or after, January 1, 1973, and <PRTPAGE P="427"/>before January 1, 2002; and upgraded locomotives manufactured prior to January 1, 1973. The standards apply when such a locomotive or locomotive engine is manufactured, remanufactured, or imported on or after January 1, 2002; except where the locomotive was previously certified to one or more FELs under subpart D of this part instead of the applicable standards, in which case, the applicable standards are replaced at each subsequent remanufacture by the FELs specified by the previous certificate. Example: a locomotive that is certified to a NO<E T="52">X</E> FEL of 8.0 g/bhp-hr must be recertified to a NO<E T="52">X</E> FEL of 8.0 g/bhp-hr at each subsequent remanufacture, except as allowed by paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tier 1.</E> Locomotives and engines used in locomotives manufactured on, or after, January 1, 2002, and before January 1, 2005 are subject to the Tier 1 standards listed in table A8-2 of this section. The standards apply when such a locomotive or locomotive engine is manufactured or imported, and each time it is remanufactured; except where the locomotive was previously certified to one or more FELs under subpart D of this part instead of the applicable standard, in which case, the standards are replaced at each subsequent remanufacture by the FELs specified by the previous certificate.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Tier 2.</E> Locomotives and engines used in locomotives manufactured on, or after, January 1, 2005 are subject to the Tier 2 standards listed in table A8-3 of this section. The standards apply when such a locomotive or locomotive engine is manufactured or imported, and each time it is remanufactured except where the locomotive was previously certified to one or more FELs under subpart D of this part instead of the applicable standard, in which case, the standards are replaced at each subsequent remanufacture by the FELs specified by the previous certificate.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Smoke standards.</E> The smoke opacity standards listed in table A8-4 of this section apply, as specified in the table, to locomotives and locomotive engines subject to the Tier 0, Tier 1, or Tier 2 standards. Smoke emissions, when measured in accordance with the provisions of subpart B of this part, shall not exceed the standards of table A8-4 of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternate standards.</E> In lieu of the CO and PM standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, manufacturers and remanufacturers may elect to comply with the alternate CO and PM standards listed in table A8-5 of this section. Manufacturers and remanufacturers electing to comply with these alternate standards must comply with both the CO and PM standards listed in table A8-5 of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Averaging, banking and trading.</E> (i) In lieu of the NO<E T="52">X</E> and/or PM standards specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, manufacturers and remanufacturers may elect to include engine families in the averaging, banking, and trading program, the provisions of which are specified in subpart D of this part. The manufacturer or remanufacturer must set family emission limits (FEL) for the applicable duty-cycle. This FEL serves as the standard for that family.</P>
              <P>(ii) When a locomotive is certified to an FEL other than the applicable standard, it must be recertified to that same FEL at all subsequent remanufactures, except as specified otherwise in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) After a locomotive has been certified to any given FEL other than the applicable standard, it may be recertified to a different FEL at a subsequent remanufacture, as allowed by subpart D of this part. For subsequent remanufactures (i.e. those remanufactures that occur after the recertification to a different FEL), the locomotive must be recertified to the FEL(s) and standards that were applicable to the locomotive during its previous useful life, except where specified otherwise by subpart D of this part.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 92.9</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Compliance with emission standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The general standards in § 92.7 and the emission standards in § 92.8 apply to the emissions from new locomotives and new locomotive engines for their useful life. The useful life is specified as MW-hrs and years, and ends when either of the values (MW-hrs or years) is exceeded.</P>
              <P>(1) The minimum useful life in terms of MW-hrs is equal to the product of the rated horsepower multiplied by 7.50. The minimum useful life in terms of years is ten years. For locomotives or locomotive engines originally manufactured before January 1, 2000 and not equipped with MW-hr meters, the minimum useful life is equal to 750,000 miles or ten years, whichever is reached first.</P>
              <P>(2) The certifying manufacturer or remanufacturer shall specify a longer useful life if the locomotive or locomotive engine is designed to last longer than the applicable minimum useful life. A manufacturer's or remanufacturer's recommended time to remanufacture which is longer than the minimum useful life is one indicator of a longer design life.</P>
              <P>(3) Manufacturers and remanufacturers of non-locomotive-specific engines (as defined in § 92.2) may petition the Administrator prior to certification to allow a shorter useful life for an engine family containing only non-locomotive-specific engines. This petition must include the full rationale behind the request together with any other supporting evidence. Based on this or other information, the Administrator may allow a shorter useful life.</P>
              <P>(4) Remanufacturers of locomotive or locomotive engine configurations that have been previously certified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section to a useful life that is shorter than the value specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may certify to that same useful life value without request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification.</E> Certification is the process by which manufacturers and remanufacturers apply for and obtain certificates of conformity from EPA that allow the manufacturer or remanufacturer to introduce into commerce new locomotives and/or new locomotive engines for sale or use in the U.S.</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Compliance with the applicable emission standards by an engine family must be demonstrated by the certifying manufacturer or remanufacturer before a certificate of conformity may be issued under § 92.208.</P>
              <P>(A) Manufacturers shall demonstrate compliance using emission data, measured using the procedures specified in subpart B of this part, from a low mileage locomotive, or a development engine (that is equivalent in design to the locomotive engines being certified), or another low hour engine.</P>
              <P>(B) Remanufacturers shall demonstrate compliance using emission data, measured using the procedures specified in subpart B of this part, from a low mileage remanufactured locomotive, or a development engine (that is equivalent in design to the locomotive engines being certified), or another low hour remanufactured engine that was remanufactured in the manner specified in the application for certification.</P>
              <P>(ii) The emission values to compare with the standards shall be the emission values of a low mileage locomotive, or development engine, or low hour locomotive engine, adjusted by the deterioration factors developed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Before any emission value is compared with the standard, it shall be rounded, in accordance with ASTM E 29-93a (incorporated by reference at § 92.5), to the same number of decimal places as contained in the applicable standard.</P>

              <P>(2) Exhaust emission deterioration factors shall be determined by the certifying manufacturer or remanufacturer for each engine family. The manufacturer's or remanufacturer's determination is subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this <PRTPAGE P="430"/>section. The deterioration factor relates emissions from low mileage or low hour data to emissions at the end of useful life. If certification data is obtained from a development engine, and the emissions performance of that engine is significantly different from a typical low hour engine, then the deterioration factors may be adjusted for the purpose of certification.</P>

              <P>(i) A separate exhaust emission deterioration factor shall be established, as required, for compliance with applicable emission standards for HC, THCE, NMHC, CO, NO<E T="52">X</E>. particulate and smoke for each engine family.</P>

              <P>(ii)(A) For locomotives or locomotive engines not utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., catalyst). For HC, THCE, NMHC, CO, NO<E T="52">X</E>. and PM, additive deterioration factors shall be used; that is, a deterioration factor that when added to the low mileage emission rate equals the emission rate at the end of useful life. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer or remanufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this section.</P>

              <P>(B) For locomotives or locomotive engines utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., catalyst). For HC, THCE, NMHC, CO, NO<E T="52">X</E>. and PM, Multiplicative deterioration factors shall be used; that is deterioration factors that when multiplied by the low mileage emission rate equal the emission rate at the end of useful life. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer or remanufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of this paragraph (b).</P>
              <P>(C) For all locomotives and locomotive engines. For smoke, additive deterioration factors shall be used. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer or remanufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this paragraph (b).</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of a multiplicative exhaust emission deterioration factor, the factor shall be rounded to three places to the right of the decimal point in accordance with ASTM E 29-93a (incorporated by reference at § 92.5). In the case of an additive exhaust emission deterioration factor, the factor shall be established to a minimum of two places to the right of the decimal in accordance with ASTM E 29-93a (incorporated by reference at § 92.5).</P>
              <P>(iv) Every deterioration factor must be, in the Administrator's judgement, consistent with emissions increases observed in-use based on emission testing of similar locomotives or locomotive engines. Deterioration factors that predict emission increases over the useful life of a locomotive or locomotive engine that are significantly less than the emission increases over the useful life observed from in-use testing of similar locomotives or locomotive engines shall not be used.</P>

              <P>The provisions of this section are intended to address problems that could occur near the date on which more stringent emission standards become effective, such as the transition from the Tier 1 standards to the Tier 2 standards on January 1, 2005.</P>
              <P>(a) In appropriate extreme and unusual circumstances which are clearly outside the control of the manufacturer and which could not have been avoided by the exercise of prudence, diligence, and due care, the Administrator may permit a manufacturer, for a brief period, to introduce into commerce locomotives which do not comply with the applicable emission standards if:</P>
              <P>(1) The locomotives cannot reasonably be manufactured in such a manner that they would be able to comply with the applicable standards;</P>

              <P>(2) The manufacture of the locomotives was substantially completed <PRTPAGE P="431"/>prior to the applicability date of the standards from which the manufacturer seeks relief;</P>
              <P>(3) Manufacture of the locomotives was previously scheduled to be completed at such a point in time that locomotives would have been included in the previous model year, such that they would have been subject to less stringent standards, and that such schedule was feasible under normal conditions;</P>
              <P>(4) The manufacturer demonstrates that the locomotives comply with the less stringent standards that applied to the previous model year's production described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, as prescribed by subpart C of this part (i.e., that the locomotives are identical to locomotives certified in the previous model year);</P>
              <P>(5) The manufacturer exercised prudent planning and was not able to avoid the violation and has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of the nonconformity; and</P>

              <P>Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, the following provisions apply as specified to locomotives and locomotive engines subject to the provisions of this part:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Tier 0 standards.</E> In addition to the requirements of § 92.8(a)(1)(i), the following new locomotives and new locomotive engines are subject to the Tier 0 emission standards of § 92.8. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to passenger locomotives. The requirements of this paragraph (a) provide manufacturers of freshly manufactured locomotives two options for compliance. The first option is to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, which has the effect of requiring compliance with Tier 0 standards on average beginning on January 1, 2001 for all freshly manufactured and remanufactured locomotives originally manufactured on or after January 1, 1994. The second option requires compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section that the manufacturer make a remanufacturing system available at a reasonable cost for its primary model for the 1994 through 1997 production period prior to January 1, 2000, and to apply the same emission controls to its new production of similar locomotives. Manufacturers complying with paragraph (a)(3) of this section would be allowed to manufacture and remanufacture other locomotives without a certificate of conformity, prior to January 1, 2002, except as required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Manufacturers may comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section through compliance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Freshly manufactured locomotives.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, all freshly manufactured locomotives manufactured on or after January 1, 2001 must comply with the emission standards listed in Table A8-1 of § 92.8 and all other applicable requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Remanufactured locomotives.</E> The following locomotives (and engines used in the following locomotives) must comply with the emission standards listed in Table A8-1 of § 92.8 and all other applicable requirements of this part:</P>

              <P>(i) Locomotives originally manufactured on or after January 1, 1994, that <PRTPAGE P="432"/>are remanufactured on or after January 1, 2001; and</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">New model exemption.</E> (i) Freshly manufactured locomotive models not introduced for widespread production prior to January 1, 1998 are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section provided the manufacturer of the locomotive:</P>
              <P>(A) Has obtained a certificate of conformity and made available for use at reasonable cost before January 1, 2000, a remanufacturing system for its primary locomotive model (including its primary engine model) originally manufactured between January 1, 1994 and January 1, 1998; and</P>
              <P>(B) Complies with the emission standards listed in Table A8-1 of § 92.8 and all applicable requirements of this part for all freshly manufactured locomotives manufactured on or after January 1, 2000 that are similar to the primary model described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) New locomotives and locomotive engines that are manufactured and remanufactured by a manufacturer that complies with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3)(i) (A) and (B) of this section, and that are not similar to the locomotive models identified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) (A) and (B) of this section are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Make available at a reasonable cost means to make a certified remanufacturing system available for use where:</P>
              <P>(i) The total cost to the owner and user of the locomotive (including initial hardware, increased fuel consumption, and increased maintenance costs) during the useful life of the locomotive is less than $220,000; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The initial hardware costs are reasonably related to the technology included in the remanufacturing system and are less than $50,000 for 2-stroke locomotives and 4-stroke locomotives equipped with split cooling systems, or $125,000 for 4-stroke locomotives not equipped with split cooling systems; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The system will not increase fuel consumption by more than 3 percent; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The remanufactured locomotive will have reliability throughout its useful life that is similar to the reliability the locomotive would have had if it had been remanufactured without the certified remanufacture system.</P>
              <P>(5)(i) Instead of the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a manufacturer may comply with the emissions standards listed in Table A8-1 of § 92.8 and all other applicable requirements of this part with respect to any combination of locomotive models that are manufactured or remanufactured on or after January 1, 2000, provided that the manufacturer has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that such locomotives will produce greater emissions reductions than would otherwise occur through compliance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) New locomotives and locomotive engines that are manufactured and remanufactured by a manufacturer that complies with the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, and that are not similar to the locomotive models identified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production line and in-use testing.</E> (1) The requirements of Subpart F of this part (i.e., production line testing) do not apply prior to January 1, 2002.</P>

              <P>(3) The requirements of Subpart G of this part (i.e., in-use testing) only apply for locomotives and locomotive engines that become new on or after January 1, 2002.</P>

              <P>(4) For locomotives and locomotive engines that are covered by a small business certificate of conformity, the requirements of Subpart G of this part (i.e., in-use testing) only apply for locomotives and locomotive engines that <PRTPAGE P="433"/>become new on or after January 1, 2007. We will also not require small remanufacturers to perform any in-use testing prior to January 1, 2013.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Small business certificates of conformity.</E> (1) Prior to January 1, 2007, small remanufacturers (as defined in § 92.2) may use a modified version of the federal test procedures of subpart B of this part to obtain certificates of conformity. Such certificates are valid only for production that occurs prior to January 1, 2007. Specifically, the following modifications are allowed:</P>
              <P>(i) Measurement of HC, CO, and PM may be omitted;</P>
              <P>(ii) Dynamometers are not required to meet the specifications of subpart B of this part, provided their design and use is consistent with good engineering practice;</P>

              <P>(2)(i) Small remanufacturers may use test procedures other than those specified in subpart B of this part or in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to obtain certificates of conformity, provided that the test procedures are consistent with good engineering practice, and are approved by the Administrator prior to the start of testing. Such certificates are valid only for production that occurs prior to January 1, 2007.</P>
              <P>(ii) The total number of locomotives and locomotive engines that may be remanufactured under a certificate of conformity issued based on the testing described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall be subject to the following annual limits for each individual remanufacturer: No more than 300 units in 2003, no more than 200 units in 2004, no more than 100 units in 2005, no more than 50 units in 2006.

              <P>(1) You may ask to use a combination of the test procedures of this part and those of 40 CFR part 1033. We will approve your request if you show us that it does not affect your ability to show compliance with the applicable emission standards. Generally this requires that the combined procedures would result in emission measurements at least as high as those that would be measured using the procedures specified in this part. Alternatively, you may demonstrate that the combined effects of the procedures is small relative to your compliance margin (the degree to which your locomotives are below the applicable standards).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedures; overview.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emission tests of locomotives and locomotive engines. The procedures specified here are intended to measure brake-specific mass emissions of organic compounds (hydrocarbons for locomotives using petroleum diesel fuel), oxides of nitrogen, particulates, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and smoke in a manner representative of a typical operating cycle.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The sampling systems specified in this subpart are intended to collect representative samples for analysis, and minimize losses of all analytes.</P>
              <P>(i) For gaseous emissions, a sample of the raw exhaust is collected directly from the exhaust stream and analyzed during each throttle setting.</P>
              <P>(ii) Particulates are collected on filters following dilution with ambient air of a separate raw exhaust sample.</P>

              <P>(2) Analytical equipment is identical for all fuel types, with the exception of the systems used to measure organics (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> hydrocarbons, alcohols, and aldehydes); diesel-fueled and biodiesel-fueled locomotives <E T="03">Parts per million</E> and locomotive engines require a heated, continuous hydrocarbon detector; natural gas-fueled locomotives and locomotive engines require a continuous hydrocarbon detector and a methane detector; alcohol-fueled locomotives and locomotive engines require a heated hydrocarbon detector, alcohol sampling and detection systems, and aldehyde sampling and detection systems. Necessary equipment and specifications appear in §§ 92.105 through 92.111.</P>

              <P>(3) Fuel specifications for emission testing are specified in § 92.113. Analytical gases are specified in § 92.112.<PRTPAGE P="436"/>

              <P>(e) Locomotives and locomotive engines are tested using the test sequence as detailed in §§ 92.124 and 92.126.</P>
              <P>(f) Alternate sampling and/or analytical systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results, and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Guidelines for determining equivalency are found in Appendix IV of this part.</P>
              <P>(g) At the time of the creation of this part, essentially all locomotives and locomotive engines subject to the standards of this part were designed to use diesel fuel. Therefore, the testing provisions of this subpart focus primarily on that fuel. Some provisions for fuels other than diesel are also included. If a manufacturer or remanufacturer of locomotives or locomotive engines, or a user of locomotives, or other party wishes or intends to use a fuel other than diesel in locomotives or locomotive engines, it shall notify the Administrator, who shall specify those changes to the test procedures that are necessary for the testing to be consistent with good engineering practice. The changes made under this paragraph (g) shall be limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) Exhaust gas sampling and analysis;</P>
              <P>(2) Test fuels; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exhaust gas and particulate sampling and analytical system.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) During emission testing, the engine exhaust is routed through an exhaust duct connected to, or otherwise adjacent to the outlet of the locomotive exhaust system. Emission samples are collected as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Exhaust duct requirements are specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The systems described in this section are appropriate for use with locomotives or engines employing a single exhaust.</P>
              <P>(i) For testing where the locomotive or engine has multiple exhausts all exhaust streams shall be combined into a single stream prior to sampling, except as allowed by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) For locomotive testing where the locomotive has multiple exhaust stacks, proportional samples may be collected from each exhaust outlet instead of ducting the exhaust stacks together, provided that the CO<E T="52">2</E> concentrations in each exhaust stream are shown (either prior to testing or during testing) to be within 5 percent of each other at notch 8.</P>
              <P>(3) All vents, including analyzer vents, bypass flow, and pressure relief vents of regulators, should be vented in such a manner to avoid endangering personnel in the immediate area.</P>
              <P>(4) Additional components, not specified here, such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, switches, and so forth, may be employed to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems, provided that their use is consistent with good engineering practice. Any variation from the specifications in this subpart including performance specifications and emission detection methods may be used only with prior approval by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Raw exhaust sampling for gaseous emissions.</E> (1)(i) An example of the type of sampling and analytical system which is to be used for gaseous emissions testing under this subpart is shown in Figure B114-1 of this section. All components or parts of components that are wetted by the sample or corrosive calibration gases shall be either chemically cleaned stainless steel or other inert material, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene resin. The use of “gauge savers” or “protectors” with nonreactive diaphragms to reduce dead volumes is permitted. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, switches, etc. may be employed to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">System components list.</E> The following is a list of components shown in Figure B114-1 of this section by numeric identifier.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Filters.</E> Glass fiber filter paper is permitted for the fine particulate filters (F1, F2, and F3). Optional filter F4 is a coarse filter for large particulates. Filters F3 and F4 are heated filters</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Flowmeters.</E> Flowmeters FL1 and FL2 indicate sample flow rates through the CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> analyzers. Flowmeters FL3, FL4, FL5, and FL6 indicate bypass flow rates.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Gauges.</E> Downstream gauges are required for any system used for testing under this subpart. Upstream gauges may be required under this subpart. Upstream gauges G1 and G2 measure the input to the CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> analyzers. Downstream gauges G3 and G4 measure the exit pressure of the CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> analyzers. If the normal operating range of the downstream gauges is less than 3 inches of water, then the downstream gauges must be capable of reading both pressure and vacuum. Gauges G3 and G4 are not necessary if the analyzers are vented directly to atmospheric pressure.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Pressure gauges.</E> P1 is a bypass pressure gauge; P2, P3, P4, and P5 are <PRTPAGE P="447"/>for sample or span pressure at inlet to flow control valves.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Water traps.</E> Water traps WT1 and WT2 to remove water from the sample. A water trap performing the function of WT1 is required for any system used for testing under this subpart. Chemical dryers are not an acceptable method of removing the water. Water removal by condensation is acceptable. If water is removed by condensation, the sample gas temperature or sample dew point must be monitored either within the water trap or downstream; it may not exceed 45 °F (7 °C). Means other than condensation may be used only with prior approval from the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Regulators.</E> R1, R3, R4, and R6 are line pressure regulators to control span pressure at inlet to flow control valves; R2 and R5 are back pressure regulators to control sample pressure at inlet to flow control valves.</P>
              <P>(G) <E T="03">Valves.</E> V1, V7, V8, and V14 are selector valves to select zero or calibration gases; V2 are optional heated selector valves to purge the sample probe, perform leak checks, or to perform hang-up checks; V3 and V5 are selector valves to select sample or span gases; V4, V6, and V15 are flow control valves; V9 and V13—heated selector valve to select sample or span gases; V10 and V12—heated flow control valves; V11—Selector valve to select NO<E T="52">X</E> or bypass mode in the chemiluminescence analyzer; V16—heated selector valve to perform leak checks.</P>
              <P>(H) <E T="03">Pump.</E> Sample transfer pump to transport sample to analyzers.</P>
              <P>(I) <E T="03">Temperature sensor.</E> A temperature sensor (T1) to measure the NO<E T="52">2</E> to NO converter temperature is required for any system used for testing under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(J) <E T="03">Dryer.</E> Dryers D1 and D2 to remove the water from the bypass flows to prevent condensation in flowmeters FL3, FL4, and FL6.</P>
              <P>(2) The following requirements must be incorporated in each gaseous sampling system used for testing under this subpart:</P>
              <P>(i) The exhaust is analyzed for gaseous emissions using analyzers meeting the specifications of § 92.109, and all analyzers must obtain the sample to be analyzed from the same sample probe, and internally split to the different analyzers.</P>
              <P>(ii) Sample transfer lines must be heated as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide measurements must be made on a dry basis. Specific requirements for the means of drying the sample can be found in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(E) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) All NDIR analyzers must have a pressure gauge immediately downstream of the analyzer. The gauge tap must be within 2 inches of the analyzer exit port. Gauge specifications can be found in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) All bypass and analyzer flows exiting the analysis system must be measured. Capillary flows such as in HFID and CL analyzers are excluded. For each NDIR analyzer with a flow meter located upstream of the analyzer, an upstream pressure gauge must be used. The gauge tap must be within 2 inches of the analyzer entrance port.</P>
              <P>(vi) Calibration or span gases for the NO<E T="52">X</E> measurement system must pass through the NO<E T="52">2</E> to NO converter.</P>
              <P>(vii) The temperature of the NO<E T="52">2</E> to NO converter must be displayed continuously.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Gaseous sample probe.</E> (i) The gaseous emissions sample probe shall be a straight, closed end, stainless steel, multi-hole probe. The inside diameter shall not be greater than the inside diameter of the sample line by more than 0.01 inches (0.03 cm).

              <P>(ii) The gaseous emissions sample probe shall have a minimum of three holes in each 3 inch segment of length of the probe. The spacing of the radial planes for each hole in the probe must be such that they cover approximately equal cross-sectional areas of the exhaust duct. The angular spacing of the holes must be approximately equal. The angular spacing of any two holes in one plane may not be 180 °±20° (see <PRTPAGE P="448"/>section view C-C of Figure B114-2 of this section). The holes should be sized such that each has approximately the same flow. If only three holes are used in each 3 inch segment of probe length, they may not all be in the same radial plane.</P>
              <P>(iii) The sample probe shall be so located in the center of the exhaust duct to minimize stratification, with respect to both concentration and velocity, present in the exhaust stream. The probe shall be located between two feet and five feet downstream of the locomotive exhaust outlet (or nearest practical equivalent during engine testing), and at least 1 foot upstream of the outlet of the exhaust duct to the atmosphere.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the exhaust duct is circular in cross section, the sample probe should extend approximately radially across the exhaust duct, and approximately through the center of the duct. The sample probe must extend across at least 80 percent of the diameter of the duct.</P>

The sample probe must extend across at least 80 percent of the longest axis of the duct which is not a diagonal, and be approximately parallel to the longest sides of the duct.</P>
              <P>(vi) Other sample probe designs and/or locations may be used only if demonstrated (to the Administrator's satisfaction) to provides a more representative sample.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Sample transfer line(s).</E> (i) The maximum inside diameter of the gaseous emissions sample line shall not exceed 0.52 inches (1.32 cm).</P>
              <P>(ii) If valve V2 is used, the sample probe must connect directly to valve V2. The location of optional valve V2 may not be greater than 4 feet (1.22 m) from the exhaust duct.</P>

              <P>(iii) The sample transport system from the engine exhaust duct to the HC analyzer and the NO<E T="52">X</E> analyzer must be heated as is indicated in Figure B114-1 of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) For diesel fueled and biodiesel fueled locomotives and engines, the wall temperature of the HC sample line must be maintained at 375 ±20 °F (191 ±11 °C). An exception is made for the first 4 feet (122 cm) of sample line from the exhaust duct. The upper temperature tolerance for this 4 foot section is waived and only the minimum temperature specification applies.</P>
              <P>(B) For locomotives and engines using fuels other than diesel or biodiesel, the heated components in the HC sample path shall be maintained at a temperature approved by the Administrator, not exceeding 446 °F (230 °C).</P>
              <P>(C) For all fuels, wall temperature of the NO<E T="52">X</E> sample line must be maintained between 140 °F (60 °C) and 446 °F (230 °C). An exception is made for the first 4 feet (122 cm) of sample line from the exhaust duct. The upper temperature tolerance for this 4 foot section is waived and only the minimum temperature specification applies.</P>
              <P>(D) For each component (pump, sample line section, filters, etc.) in the heated portion of the sampling system that has a separate source of power or heating element, use engineering judgment to locate the coolest portion of that component and monitor the temperature at that location. If several components are within an oven, then only the surface temperature of the component with the largest thermal mass and the oven temperature need be measured.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Particulate emissions.</E> (1)(i) Schematic drawing. An example of a sampling system which may be used for particulate emissions testing under this subpart is shown in Figure B114-3 of this section. All components or parts of components that are wetted by the samples gases upstream of the filter shall be either chemically cleaned stainless steel or other inert material, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene resin. The use of “gauge savers” or “protectors” with nonreactive diaphragms to reduce dead volumes is permitted. Additional components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, switches, etc. may be employed to provide additional information and coordinate the functions of the component systems.<PRTPAGE P="449"/>

              <P>(B) The wall temperature of the sample transport system from the probe to the dilution tunnel (excluding the first 4 feet of the particulate transfer tube) must be maintained at 375 °F to 395 °F (191 °C to 202 °C).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Particulate raw sample probe.</E> (i) The sample probe for the raw exhaust shall be a straight, closed end, stainless steel, multi-hole probe of approximately 1.25 inch (3.2 cm) diameter. The inside diameter shall not be greater than the inside diameter of the sample line by more than 0.1 inches (0.3 cm). The wall thickness of the probe shall not be greater than 0.06 inches (0.15 cm).

Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, if approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(B) Set the oven temperature 5 °C hotter than the required sample-line temperature. Allow at least one-half hour after the oven has reached temperature for the system to equilibrate.</P>

Determine the response at a given fuel flow from the difference between the span-gas response and the zero-gas response. Incrementally adjust the fuel flow above and below the manufacturer's specification. Record the span and zero response at these fuel flows. A plot of the difference between the span and zero response versus fuel flow will be similar to the one shown in Figure B119-1 of this section.

The following procedure is to be used in determining the values to be used in the equation below:</P>
              <P>(i) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup and operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer.</P>
              <P>(iii) Connect the outlet of the NO<E T="52">X</E> generator to the sample inlet of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer which has been set to the most common operating range.</P>
              <P>(iv) Introduce into the NO<E T="52">X</E> generator-analyzer system a span gas with a NO concentration equal to approximately 80 percent of the most common operating range. The NO<E T="52">2</E> content of the gas mixture shall be less than 5 percent of the NO<E T="52">X</E> concentration.</P>
              <P>(v) With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO Mode, record the concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.</P>
              <P>(vi) Turn on the NO<E T="52">X</E> generator O<E T="52">2</E> (or air) supply and adjust the O<E T="52">2</E> (or air) flow rate so that the NO indicated by the analyzer is about 10 percent less than indicated in step in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. Record the concentration of NO in this NO + O<E T="52">2</E> mixture.</P>
              <P>(vii) Switch the NO<E T="52">X</E> generator to the generation mode and adjust the generation rate so that the NO measured on the analyzer is 20 percent of that measured in step in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. There must be at least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record the concentration of residual NO.</P>

              <P>(viii) Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NO<E T="52">X</E> mode and measure total NO<E T="52">X</E>. Record this value.</P>
              <P>(ix) Switch off the NO<E T="52">X</E> generation, but maintain gas flow through the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the total NO<E T="52">X</E> in the NO + O<E T="52">2</E> mixture. Record this value.</P>
              <P>(x) Turn off the NO<E T="52">X</E> generator O<E T="52">2</E> (or air) supply.

This value should be no more than 5 percent above the value indicated in step in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(xi) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<E T="52">X</E> converter by substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:</P>
              <P>(A) Percent Efficiency = (1 + (a−b)/(c−d))(100)
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <FP>where:</FP>
                
                <FP SOURCE="FP-2">a = concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section.</FP>

              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(B) The efficiency of the converter shall be greater than 90 percent. Adjustment of the converter temperature may be necessary to maximize the efficiency. If the converter does not meet the conversion-efficiency specifications, repair or replace the unit prior to testing. Repeat the procedures of this section with the repaired or new converter.</P>
              <P>(3) Linearity check. For each range used, check linearity as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) With the operating parameters adjusted to meet the converter efficiency check and the quench checks, zero the analyzer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Span the analyzer using a calibration gas that will give a response of approximately 90 percent of full-scale concentration.</P>
              <P>(iii) Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 percent of full scale, repeat steps in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) Record the response of calibration gases having nominal concentrations of 30, 60 and 90 percent of full-scale concentration. It is permitted to use additional concentrations.</P>
              <P>(v) Perform a linear least-square regression on the data generated. Use an equation of the form y = mx where x is the actual chart deflection and y is the concentration.</P>
              <P>(vi) Use the equation z = y/m to find the linear chart deflection (z) for each calibration gas concentration (y).</P>

              <P>(vii) Determine the linearity (%L) for each calibration gas by:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Percent L = (100)(z−x)/(Full-scale chart deflection)</FP>
              
              <P>(viii) The linearity criterion is met if the %L is less than ±2 percent of each data point generated. For each emission test, a calibration curve of the form y = mx is to be used. The slope (m) is defined for each range by the spanning process.</P>
              <P>(ix) If the %L exceeds ±2 percent for any data point generated, repair or replace the analyzer or calibration bottles prior to testing. Repeat the procedures of this section with the repaired or replaced equipment or gases.</P>
              <P>(x) Perform a converter-efficiency check (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section).</P>
              <P>(xi) The operating parameters are defined as “optimized” at this point.</P>
              <P>(4) Converter checking gas. If the converter quick-check procedure is to be employed, paragraph (b)(5) of this section, a converter checking gas bottle must be named. The following naming procedure must occur after each converter efficiency check, paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) A gas bottle with an NO<E T="52">2</E> concentration equal to approximately 80 percent of the most common operation range shall be designated as the converter checking gas bottle. Its NO concentration shall be less than 25 percent of its NO<E T="52">2</E> concentration, on a volume basis.</P>

              <P>(ii) On the most common operating range, zero and span the analyzer in the NO<E T="52">X</E> mode. Use a calibration gas with a concentration equal to approximately 80 percent of the range for spanning.</P>

              <P>(iii) Introduce the converter checking gas. Analyze and record concentrations in both the NO<E T="52">X</E> mode (X) and NO mode (Y).</P>

              <P>(iv) Calculate the concentration of the converter checking gas using the results from step in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section and the converter efficiency from paragraph (b)(2) of this section as follows:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Concentration = (((X−Y)(100))/Efficiency) + Y</FP>

              <P>(i) Span the analyzer in the normal manner (NO<E T="52">X</E> mode) for the most common operating range.<PRTPAGE P="466"/>
              </P>

              <P>(iii) Compare the observed concentration with the concentration assigned under the procedure in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. If the observed concentration is equal to or greater than 90 percent of the assigned concentration, the converter operation is satisfactory.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial and periodic calibration.</E> Prior to its introduction into service and monthly thereafter, the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges. Use the same flow rate as when analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.</P>
              <P>(2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade air or zero-grade nitrogen.</P>

              <P>(3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with NO-in-N<E T="52">2</E> calibration gases with nominal concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 percent of that range. For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line is 2 percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds 2 percent at any point, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within 2 percent of each test point shall be used to determine concentration.</P>
              <P>(d) If a stainless steel NO<E T="52">2</E> to NO converter is used, condition all new or replacement converters. The conditioning consists of either purging the converter with air for a minimum of 4 hours or until the converter efficiency is greater than 90 percent. The converter must be at operational temperature while purging. Do not use this procedure prior to checking converter efficiency on in-use converters.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Test procedure; general requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The locomotive/locomotive engine test procedure is designed to determine the brake specific emissions of hydrocarbons (HC, total or non-methane as applicable), total hydrocarbon equivalent (THCE) and aldehydes (as applicable), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO<E T="52">X</E>), and particulates, and the opacity of smoke emissions. The test procedure consists of measurements of brake specific emissions and smoke opacity at each throttle position and of measurements of smoke opacity during each change in throttle position as engine power is increased. If less than 2 percent of the total exhaust flow is removed for gaseous and particulate sampling in notches 1 through 8, and if less than 4 percent of the total exhaust flow is removed for gaseous and particulate sampling at idle and dynamic brake, all measurements of gaseous, particulate and smoke emissions may be performed during one test sequence. If more than 2 percent, or 4 percent as applicable, of the total exhaust is removed for gaseous and particulate sampling, measurements of gaseous, and particulate emissions are performed during one test sequence, and a second test sequence is performed for the measurement of smoke.</P>
              <P>(1) In the raw exhaust sampling procedure, sample is collected directly from the exhaust stream during each throttle setting. Particulates are collected on filters following dilution with ambient air of another raw exhaust sample. The fuel flow rate for each throttle setting is measured.</P>
              <P>(2) For locomotives with multiple exhaust stacks, smoke testing is required for only one of the exhaust stacks provided the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(i) The stack that is not tested is not visibly smokier than the stack that is tested, and</P>
              <P>(ii) None of the measured opacity values for the stack tested are greater than three-quarters of the level allowed by any of the applicable smoke standards.</P>
              <P>(b) The test consists of prescribed sequences of engine operating conditions (see §§ 92.124 and 92.126) to be conducted either on a locomotive; or with the engine mounted on an engine dynamometer, or attached to a locomotive alternator/generator.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Locomotive testing.</E> (i) The electrical power output produced by the alternator/generator at each throttle setting is recorded as measurements of either the wattmeter or the output voltage, phase angle, and current flow through the electrical resistance bank.</P>
              <P>(ii) The locomotive fuel supply system shall be disconnected and a system capable of measuring the net rate at which fuel is supplied to the engine (accounting for fuel recycle) shall be connected.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Engine testing.</E> (i) When the test is performed using a dynamometer, engine torque and rpm shall be recorded during each throttle setting.</P>
              <P>(ii) The complete engine shall be tested, with all emission control devices, and charge air cooling equipment installed and functioning.</P>
              <P>(iii) On air-cooled engines, the engine cooling fan shall be installed.</P>

              <P>(iv) Additional accessories (e.g., air compressors) shall be installed or their loading simulated if typical of the in-use application. In the case of simulated accessory loadings, the manufacturer shall make available to the Administrator documentation which <PRTPAGE P="469"/>shows that the simulated loading is representative of in-use operation. Power for accessories necessary to operate the engine (such as fuel pumps) shall be treated as parasitic losses and would not be included in the engine power output for purposes of calculating brake specific emissions.</P>
              <P>(v) The engine may be equipped with a production type starter.</P>
              <P>(vi) Means of engine cooling shall be used which will maintain the engine operating temperatures (e.g., temperatures of intake air downstream of charge air coolers, oil, water, etc.) at approximately the same temperature as would occur in a locomotive at each test point under the equivalent ambient conditions. In the case of engine intake air after compression and cooling in the charge air cooler(s), the temperature of the air entering the engine shall be within ±5 °F, at each test point, of the typical temperatures occurring in locomotive operations under ambient conditions represented by the test. Auxiliary fan(s) may be used to maintain engine cooling during operation on the dynamometer. Rust inhibitors and lubrication additives may be used, up to the levels recommended by the additive manufacturer. If antifreeze is to be used in the locomotive application, antifreeze mixtures and other coolants typical of those approved for use in the locomotive may be used.</P>
              <P>(vii) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section apply to engine testing using a locomotive alternator/generator instead of a dynamometer.</P>

              <P>(a) Good engineering practice dictates that exhaust emission sample analyzer readings below 15 percent of full scale chart deflection should generally not be used.</P>

              <P>(b) Some high resolution read-out systems such as computers, data loggers, etc., can provide sufficient accuracy and resolution below 15 percent of full scale. Such systems may be used <PRTPAGE P="473"/>provided that additional calibrations are made to ensure the accuracy of the calibration curves. The following procedure for calibration below 15 percent of full scale may be used:</P>
              <P>(1) If a 16-point gas divider is used, 50 percent of the calibration points shall be below 10 percent of full scale. The gas divider shall conform to the accuracy requirements specified in § 92.112.</P>
              <P>(2) If a 7- or 9-point gas divider is used, the gas divider shall conform to the accuracy requirements specified in § 92.112, and shall be used according to the following procedure:</P>
              <P>(i) Span the full analyzer range using a top range calibration gas meeting the calibration gas accuracy requirements of § 92.112.</P>
              <P>(ii) Generate a calibration curve according to, and meeting the applicable requirements of §§ 92.118 through 92.122.</P>

              <P>(iii) Select a calibration gas (a span gas may be used for calibrating the CO<E T="52">2</E> analyzer) with a concentration between the two lowest non-zero gas divider increments. This gas must be “named” to an accuracy of ±1.0 percent (±2.0 percent for CO<E T="52">2</E> span gas) of NIST gas standards, or other standards approved by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(iv) Using the calibration curve fitted to the points generated in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, check the concentration of the gas selected in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section. The concentration derived from the curve shall be within ±2.3 percent (±2.8 percent for CO<E T="52">2</E> span gas) of the gas' original named concentration.</P>
              <P>(v) Provided the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section are met, use the gas divider with the gas selected in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section and determine the remainder of the calibration points. Fit a calibration curve per §§ 92.118 through 92.122 for the entire analyzer range.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Particulate handling and weighing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) At least 1 hour before the test, place each filter in a closed (to eliminate dust contamination) but unsealed (to permit humidity exchange) petri dish and place in a weighing chamber meeting the specifications of § 92.110(a) of this section for stabilization.</P>
              <P>(b) At the end of the stabilization period, weigh each filter on the microbalance. This reading is the tare weight and must be recorded.</P>
              <P>(c) The filter shall then be stored in a covered petri dish or a sealed filter holder until needed for testing. If the filters are transported to a remote test location, the filter pairs, stored in individual petri dishes, should be transported in sealed plastic bags to prevent contamination. At the conclusion of a test run, the filters should be removed from the filter holder, and placed face to face in a covered but unsealed petri dish, with the primary filter placed face up in the dish. The filters shall be weighed as a pair. If the filters need to be transported from a remote test site, back to the weighing chamber, the petri dishes should be placed in a sealed plastic bag to prevent contamination. Care should be taken in transporting the used filters such that they are not exposed to excessive, sustained direct sunlight, or excessive handling.</P>
              <P>(d) After the emissions test, and after the sample and back-up filters have been returned to the weighing room after being used, they must be conditioned for at least 1 hour but not more than 80 hours and then weighed. This reading is the gross weight of the filter and must be recorded.</P>
              <P>(e) The net weight of each filter is its gross weight minus its tare weight. Should the sample on the filter contact the petri dish or any other surface, the test is void and must be rerun.</P>
              <P>(f) The particulate filter weight (Pf) is the sum of the net weight of the primary filter plus the net weight of the backup filter.</P>
              <P>(g) The following optional weighting procedure is permitted:</P>
              <P>(1) At the end of the stabilization period, weigh both the primary and back-up filters as a pair. This reading is the tare weight and must be recorded.</P>

              <P>(2) After the emissions test, in removing the filters from the filter holder, the back-up filter is inverted on top of the primary filter. They must then be conditioned in the weighing chamber for at least 1 hour but not more than 80 hours. The filters are then weighed as a pair. This reading is the gross weight of the filters (Pf) and must be recorded.<PRTPAGE P="474"/>

              <SUBJECT>Exhaust sample analysis.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The analyzer response may be read by automatic data collection (ADC) equipment such as computers, data loggers, etc. If ADC equipment is used the following is required:</P>
              <P>(1) The response complies with § 92.130.</P>
              <P>(2) The response required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be stored on long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage discs, or they may be printed in a listing for storage. In either case a chart recorder is not required and records from a chart recorder, if they exist, need not be stored.</P>
              <P>(3) If the data from ADC equipment is used as permanent records, the ADC equipment and the analyzer values as interpreted by the ADC equipment are subject to the calibration specifications in §§ 92.118 through 92.122, as if the ADC equipment were part of the analyzer.</P>
              <P>(b) Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be stored as chart recorder records.</P>
              <P>(c) Software zero and span.</P>
              <P>(1) The use of “software” zero and span is permitted. The process of software zero and span refers to the technique of initially adjusting the analyzer zero and span responses to the calibration curve values, but for subsequent zero and span checks the analyzer response is simply recorded without adjusting the analyzer gain. The observed analyzer response recorded from the subsequent check is mathematically corrected back to the calibration curve values for zero and span. The same mathematical correction is then applied to the analyzer's response to a sample of exhaust gas in order to compute the true sample concentration.</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum amount of software zero and span mathematical correction is ±10 percent of full scale chart deflection.</P>
              <P>(3) Software zero and span may be used to switch between ranges without adjusting the gain of the analyzer.</P>
              <P>(4) The software zero and span technique may not be used to mask analyzer drift. The observed chart deflection before and after a given time period or event shall be used for computing the drift. Software zero and span may be used after the drift has been computed to mathematically adjust any span drift so that the “after” span check may be transformed into the “before” span check for the next mode.</P>
              <P>(d) For sample analysis perform the following sequence:</P>
              <P>(1) Warm-up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter elements, conditioning columns (if used), etc., as necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at negative gauge pressures when sampling, and allow heated sample lines, filters, pumps, etc., to stabilize at operating temperature.</P>
              <P>(3) Optional: Perform a hang-up check for the HFID sampling system:</P>
              <P>(i) Zero the analyzer using zero air introduced at the analyzer port.</P>
              <P>(ii) Flow zero air through the overflow sampling system, where an overflow system is used. Check the analyzer response.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the overflow zero response exceeds the analyzer zero response by 2 percent or more of the HFID full-scale deflection, hang-up is indicated and corrective action must be taken.</P>
              <P>(iv) The complete system hang-up check specified in paragraph (f) of this section is recommended as a periodic check.</P>
              <P>(4) Obtain a stable zero reading.</P>
              <P>(5) Zero and span each range to be used on each analyzer used prior to the beginning of the test sequence. The span gases shall have a concentration between 75 and 100 percent of full scale chart deflection. The flow rates and system pressures shall be approximately the same as those encountered during sampling. The HFID analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned through the overflow sampling system, where an overflow system is used.</P>

              <P>(6) Re-check zero response. If this zero response differs from the zero response recorded in paragraph (d)(5) of this section by more than 1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (d) (4), (5), <PRTPAGE P="475"/>and (6) of this section should be repeated.</P>
              <P>(7) If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.</P>
              <P>(8) If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.</P>
              <P>(9) Measure (or collect a sample of) the emissions continuously during each mode of the test cycle. Indicate the start of the test, the range(s) used, and the end of the test on the recording medium (chart paper or ADC equipment). Maintain approximately the same flow rates and system pressures used in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(10)(i) Collect background HC, CO, CO<E T="52">2</E>, and NO<E T="52">X</E> in a sample bag (optional).</P>
              <P>(ii) Measure the concentration of CO<E T="52">2</E> in the dilution air and the diluted exhaust for particulate measurements.</P>
              <P>(11) Perform a post-analysis zero and span check for each range used at the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. Record these responses as the post-analysis values.</P>

              <P>(12) Neither the zero drift nor the span drift between the pre-analysis and post-analysis checks on any range used may exceed 3 percent for HC, or 2 percent for NO<E T="52">X</E>. CO, and CO<E T="52">2</E>, of full scale chart deflection, or the test is void. (If the HC drift is greater than 3 percent of full-scale chart deflection, hydrocarbon hang-up is likely.)</P>
              <P>(13) Determine HC background levels (if necessary) by introducing the background sample into the overflow sample system.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of steady-state concentrations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) For HC and NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, a steady-state concentration measurement, measured after 300 seconds (or 840 seconds for notch 8) of testing shall be used instead of an integrated concentration for the calculations in § 92.132 if the concentration response meets either of the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section and the criterion of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions, a steady-state concentration measurement, measured after 300 seconds (or 840 seconds for notch 8) of testing shall be used. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section do not apply for CO and CO<E T="52">2</E> emissions.</P>
              <P>(b) (1) The steady-state concentration is considered representative of the entire measurement period if the time-weighted concentration is not more than 10 percent higher than the steady-state concentration. The time-weighted concentration is determined by integrating the concentration response (with respect to time in seconds) over the first 360 seconds (or 900 seconds for notch 8) of measurement, and dividing the area by 360 seconds (or 900 seconds for notch 8).</P>
              <P>(2) A steady-state concentration is considered representative of the entire measurement period if the estimated peak area is not more than 10 percent of the product of the steady-state concentration and 360 seconds (or 900 seconds for notch 8). The estimated peak area is calculated as follows, and as shown in Figure B130-1 of this section):</P>
              <P>(i) Draw the peak baseline as a straight horizontal line intersecting the steady-state response.</P>

              <P>(ii) Measure the peak height from the baseline with the same units as the steady-state concentration; this value is h.<PRTPAGE P="476"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Bisect the peak height by drawing a straight horizontal line halfway between the top of the peak and the baseline.</P>
              <P>(iv) Draw a straight line from the top of the peak to the baseline such that it intersects the response curve at the same point at which the line described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section intersects the response curve.</P>
              <P>(v) Determine the time between the point at which the notch was changed and the point at which the line described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section intersects the baseline; this value is t.</P>
              <P>(vi) The estimated peak area is equal to the product of h and t, divided by 2.</P>
              <P>(c) In order to be considered to be a steady-state measurement, a measured response may not vary by more than 5 percent after the first 60 seconds of measurement.</P>
              <P>(d) For responses meeting either of the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section, but not meeting the criterion of paragraph (c) of this section, one of the following values shall be used instead of a steady-state or integrated concentration:</P>
              <P>(1) The highest value of the response that is measured after the first 60 seconds of measurement (excluding peaks lasting less than 5 seconds, caused by such random events as the cycling of an air compressor); or</P>
              <P>(2) The highest 60-second, time-weighted, average concentration of the response after the first 60 seconds of measurement.</P>
              <P>(e) For responses not meeting the criterion in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator may require that the manufacturer or remanufacturer identify the cause of the variation, and demonstrate that it is not caused by a defeat device.</P>
              <P>(f) The integrated concentration used for calculations shall be from the highest continuous 120 seconds of measurement.</P>
              <P>(g) Compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not require calculation where good engineering practice allows compliance to be determined visually (i.e., that the area of the peak is much less than the limits set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).</P>

              <P>(iii) Calculation of individual pollutant masses. Calculations for mass emission are shown here in multiple forms. One set of equations is used when sample is analyzed dry (equations where the concentrations are expressed as DX), and the other set is used when the sample is analyzed wet (equations where the concentrations are expressed as WX). When samples are analyzed for some constituents dry and for some constituents wet, the wet concentrations must be converted to dry concentrations, and the equations for dry concentrations used. Also, the equations for HC, NMHC, CO, and NO<E T="52">X</E> have multiple forms that are algebraically equivalent: An explicit form that requires intermediate calculation of V<E T="52">m</E> and DVol or WVol; and an implicit form that uses only the concentrations (e.g., DCO) and the mass flow rate of the fuel. For these calculations, either form may be used.</P>

              <P>This section specifies the procedure and requirements for grouping of engines into engine families.</P>
              <P>(a) Manufacturers and remanufacturers shall divide their locomotives and locomotive engines into groupings of locomotives and locomotive engines which are expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their useful life.

              <P>(19) The type of exhaust aftertreatment system (oxidation catalyst, particulate trap), and characteristics of the aftertreatment system (catalyst loading, converter size vs engine size).</P>
              <P>(c) For Tier 0 locomotives and locomotive engines, the following characteristics distinguish engine families:</P>
              <P>(1) The combustion cycle (e.g., diesel cycle);</P>
              <P>(2) The type of engine cooling employed (air-cooled or water-cooled), and procedure(s) employed to maintain engine temperature within desired limits (thermostat, on-off radiator fan(s), radiator shutters, etc.);</P>

              <P>(d) Upon request by the manufacturer or remanufacturer, locomotives or locomotive engines that are eligible to be included in the same engine family based on the criteria in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section may be divided into different engine families. This request must be accompanied by information the manufacturer or remanufacturer believes supports the addition of these different engine families. For the purposes of determining whether an engine family is a small engine family in § 92.603(a)(2), EPA will consider the number of locomotives or locomotive engines that could have been classed together under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, instead of the number of locomotives or locomotive engines that are included in a subdivision allowed by this paragraph (d).</P>
              <P>(e) Upon request by the manufacturer or remanufacturer, the Administrator may allow locomotives or locomotive engines that would be required to be grouped into separate engine families based on the criteria in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to be grouped into a single engine family if the manufacturer or remanufacturer demonstrates that similar emission characteristics will occur. This request must be accompanied by emission information supporting the appropriateness of such combined engine families.</P>
              <P>(f) Remanufactured Tier 2 locomotives may be included in the same engine family as freshly manufactured Tier 2 locomotives, provided such engines are used for locomotive models included in the engine family.</P>

              <P>(a) This paragraph (a) applies to manufacturers of new locomotives and new locomotive engines. If, after a review of the application for certification, test <PRTPAGE P="494"/>reports and data acquired from a freshly manufactured locomotive or locomotive engine or from a development data engine, and any other information required or obtained by EPA, the Administrator determines that the application is complete and that the engine family meets the requirements of the Act and this part, he/she will issue a certificate of conformity with respect to such engine family except as provided by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The certificate of conformity is valid for each engine family starting with the indicated effective date, but it is not valid for any production after December 31 of the model year for which it is issued (except as specified in § 92.12). The certificate of conformity is valid upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to ensure that the production engines covered by the certificate will meet the requirements of the Act and of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) This paragraph (b) applies to remanufacturers of locomotives and locomotive engines. If, after a review of the application for certification, test reports and data acquired from a remanufactured locomotive or locomotive engine or from a development data engine, and any other information required or obtained by EPA, the Administrator determines that the engine family meets the requirements of the Act and of this subpart, he/she will issue a certificate of conformity with respect to such engine family except as provided by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The certificate of conformity is valid for each engine family from the date of issuance by EPA until 31 December of the model year or calendar year for which it is issued and upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems necessary or appropriate to assure that the production locomotives or engines covered by the certificate will meet the requirements of the Act and of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) This paragraph (c) applies to manufacturers and remanufacturers of locomotives and locomotive engines.</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer or remanufacturer shall bear the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the certificates were issued were satisfied or excused.</P>

              <P>(3) Notwithstanding the fact that any locomotive(s) or locomotive engine(s) may comply with other provisions of this subpart, the Administrator may withhold or deny the issuance of any certificate of conformity, or suspend or revoke any such certificate(s) which has (have) been issued with respect to any such locomotive(s) or locomotive engine(s) if:</P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer or remanufacturer submits false or incomplete information in its application for certification thereof;</P>
              <P>(ii) The manufacturer or remanufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which it submits pertaining thereto or otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act, or of this part with respect to such locomotive or locomotive engine;</P>
              <P>(iii) Any EPA Enforcement Officer is denied access on the terms specified in § 92.215 to any facility or portion thereof which contains any of the following:</P>
              <P>(A) A locomotive or locomotive engine which is scheduled to undergo emissions testing, or which is undergoing emissions testing, or which has undergone emissions testing; or</P>
              <P>(B) Any components used or considered for use in the construction, modification or buildup of any locomotive or locomotive engine which is scheduled to undergo emissions testing, or which is undergoing emissions testing, or which has undergone emissions testing for purposes of emissions certification; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any production locomotive or production locomotive engine which is or will be claimed by the manufacturer or remanufacturer to be covered by the certificate; or</P>
              <P>(D) Any step in the construction of a locomotive or locomotive engine, where such step may reasonably be expected to have an effect on emissions; or</P>

              <P>(4) In any case in which a manufacturer or remanufacturer knowingly submits false or inaccurate information or knowingly renders inaccurate or invalid any test data or commits any other fraudulent acts and such acts contribute substantially to the Administrator's decision to issue a certificate of conformity, the Administrator may deem such certificate void <E T="03">ab initio.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(5) In any case in which certification of a locomotive or locomotive engine is to be withheld, denied, revoked or suspended under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and in which the Administrator has presented to the manufacturer or remanufacturer involved reasonable evidence that a violation of § 92.215 in fact occurred, the manufacturer or remanufacturer, if it wishes to contend that, even though the violation occurred, the locomotive or locomotive engine in question was not involved in the violation to a degree that would warrant withholding, denial, revocation or suspension of certification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, shall have the burden of establishing that contention to the satisfaction of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(6) Any revocation, suspension, or voiding of certification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Be made only after the manufacturer or remanufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with § 92.216; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce of locomotives or locomotive engines previously covered by the certification which are still in the hands of the manufacturer or remanufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or other misconduct that makes the certification invalid <E T="03">ab initio.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(7) The manufacturer or remanufacturer may request, within 30 days of receiving notification, that any determination made by the Administrator under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to withhold or deny certification be reviewed in a hearing conducted in accordance with § 92.216. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of the manufacturer or remanufacturer as applicable, and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of such objections. If the Administrator finds, after a review of the request and supporting data, that the request raises a substantial factual issue, he/she will grant the request with respect to such issue.</P>
              <P>(d) In approving an application for certification, the Administrator may specify:</P>
              <P>(1) A broader range of adjustability than recommended by the manufacturer or remanufacturer for those locomotive or engine parameters which are to be subject to adjustment, if the Administrator determines that it will not be practical to keep the parameter adjusted within the recommended range in use;</P>
              <P>(2) A longer useful life period, if the Administrator determines that the useful life of the locomotives and locomotive engines in the engine family, as defined in § 92.2, is longer than the period specified by the manufacturer or remanufacturer; and/or</P>
              <P>(3) Larger deterioration factors, if the Administrator determines that the deterioration factors specified by the manufacturer or remanufacturer do not meet the requirements of § 92.9(b)(2)(iv).</P>

              <P>(e) Within 30 days following receipt of notification of the Administrator's determinations made under paragraph (d) of this section, the manufacturer or remanufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's determinations. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of the manufacturer or remanufacturer as applicable, and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after review of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual issue, the manufacturer or remanufacturer shall be provided with a hearing <PRTPAGE P="496"/>in accordance with § 92.216 with respect to such issue.</P>

              <P>The definitions of subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The following definitions also apply.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Applicable standard</E> means a standard that would have otherwise been applicable had the locomotive or locomotive engine not been certified under this <PRTPAGE P="505"/>subpart to an FEL different than that standard.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Transfer</E> means to convey control of credits generated from an individual locomotive to the purchaser, owner or operator of the locomotive at the time of manufacture or remanufacture; or to convey control of previously generated credits from the purchaser, owner or operator of an individual locomotive to the manufacturer or remanufacturer at the time of manufacture or remanufacture.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 92.303</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Participation in the averaging, banking and trading program is voluntary. A manufacturer or remanufacturer may choose to involve some or all of its families in any or all aspects of the program.</P>

              <P>(b) An engine family is eligible to participate in the certification averaging, banking, and trading program for NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM emissions if it is subject to regulation under this part with certain exceptions specified in paragraph (c) of this section. No averaging, banking and trading program is available for meeting the HC, CO, or smoke emission standards of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) Locomotives and locomotive engines may not participate in the certification averaging, banking, and trading program if they are exported. Only locomotive and locomotive engines certified under this part are eligible for inclusion in this certification averaging, banking, and trading program.</P>
              <P>(d) Averaging involves the generation of credits by a manufacturer or remanufacturer for use by that same manufacturer or remanufacturer in the same calendar year. A manufacturer or remanufacturer may use averaging during certification to offset an emission exceedance of an engine family caused by an FEL above the applicable emission standard, subject to the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(e) Banking involves the generation of credits by a manufacturer or remanufacturer in a given calendar year for use in a subsequent model year. A manufacturer or remanufacturer may bank actual credits only after the end of the calendar year and after EPA has reviewed the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's end-of-year reports. During the calendar year and before submittal of the end-of-year report, credits originally designated in the certification process for banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for trading or averaging in the end-of-year report. Credits declared for banking from the previous calendar year that have not been reviewed by EPA may be used in averaging or trading transactions. However, such credits may be revoked at a later time following EPA review of the end-of-year report or any subsequent audit actions.</P>
              <P>(f) Trading involves the sale of banked credits for use in certification of new locomotives and new locomotive engines under this part. Only banked credits may be traded; reserved credits may not be traded.</P>
              <P>(g) Credit transfer involves the conveying of control over credits, as defined in § 92.302. Transferred credits can be used in averaging or in subsequent transfers. Transferred credits may also be reserved for later banking. Transferred credits may not be traded unless they have been previously banked.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 92.304</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Compliance requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Manufacturers or remanufacturers wishing to participate in certification averaging, banking and trading programs shall select a FEL for each engine family they wish to include. The level of the FEL shall be selected by the manufacturer or remanufacturer, subject to the upper limits described in paragraph (k) of this section. An engine family certified to an FEL is subject to all provisions specified in this part, except that the applicable FEL replaces the applicable NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM emission standard for the family participating in the averaging, banking, and trading program.<PRTPAGE P="506"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) A manufacturer or remanufacturer may certify one or more engine families at FELs above or below the applicable emission standard, provided the summation of the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's projected balance of all credit transactions in a given calendar year is greater than or equal to zero, as calculated for each family under § 92.305 and reported under § 92.309.</P>
              <P>(c) Manufacturers and remanufacturers certifying engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable emission standard shall obtain emission credits in amounts sufficient to address the shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, banking, trading or transfer, subject to the restrictions described in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) Manufacturers and remanufacturers certifying engine families with FELs below the applicable emission standard may generate emission credits to average, bank, trade, or transfer, or a combination thereof.</P>
              <P>(e) Credits may only be used for certification; they may not be used to remedy a violation of the FEL determined by production line or in-use testing. Credits may be used to allow subsequent production of engines for an engine family failing production line testing if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL</P>
              <P>(f) If an FEL is changed after initial certification in any given model year, the manufacturer/remanufacturer must conduct production line testing to verify that the emission levels are achieved.</P>

              <P>(g) Manufacturers and remanufacturers participating in the averaging, banking and trading program must demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards at the end of the model year. Manufacturers and remanufacturers that have certified engine families to FELs above the applicable emission standards and do not have sufficient emission credits to offset the difference between the emission standard and the FEL for such engine family(ies) will be in violation of the conditions of the certificate of conformity for such engine family(ies). The certificates of conformity may be voided <E T="03">ab initio</E> for those engine families.</P>

              <P>(h) In the event of a negative credit balance resulting from a credit trade or transfer, both the buyer(s) and the seller(s) are liable, except in cases involving fraud. Certificates of all engine families participating in a negative trade may be voided <E T="03">ab initio.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Where a buyer of credits is not responsible for causing the negative credit balance, it is only liable to supply additional credits equivalent to any amount of invalid credits that it used.</P>
              <P>(2) Credit holders responsible for the credit shortfall may be subject to the requirements of § 92.309(g)(3).</P>
              <P>(i) Averaging sets. This subpart includes separate programs for compliance with each type of cycle-weighted standards in § 92.8 (i.e., line-haul and switch). Credits generated over the line-haul duty-cycle may not be used for compliance with the switch duty-cycle, and credits generated over the switch duty-cycle may not be used for compliance with the line-haul duty-cycle.</P>

              <P>(j) Cross tier credit exchanges. Cross tier credit exchanges for NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM emission credits may be exchanged between and among Tier 0, Tier 1, and Tier 2 engine families with the following exceptions:</P>

              <P>(1) For 2005 and 2006 model year freshly manufactured locomotives, manufacturers may use PM credits for all of their freshly manufactured engine families. Manufacturers may use NO<E T="52">X</E> credits only for engine families that are projected to represent 75 percent or less of their total projected annual production of freshly manufactured locomotives. The remainder must comply with the Tier 2 NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standards without the use of credits.</P>

              <P>(2) For 2007 and later model year freshly manufactured locomotives, manufacturers may use PM credits for all of their freshly manufactured engine families. Manufacturers may use NO<E T="52">X</E> credits only for engine families that are projected to represent 50 percent or less of their total projected annual production of freshly manufactured locomotives. The remainder must comply with the Tier 2 NO<E T="52">X</E> emission standards without the use of credits.</P>

              <P>(3) Credits generated from remanufactured locomotives prior to January 1, 2002 and which are banked may only <PRTPAGE P="507"/>be used for compliance with the Tier 1 or later emission standards.</P>
              <P>(k) Upper limits. The FELs for NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM for new locomotives and new locomotive engines certified to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 standards may not exceed the following values:</P>
              <P>(1) Tier 1: the Tier 0 standards.</P>
              <P>(2) Tier 2: the Tier 1 standards, except as noted in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(l) Credit life shall be unlimited.</P>
              <P>(m) Credits may be generated by any certifying manufacturer or remanufacturer and may be held by any of the following entities:</P>
              <P>(1) Locomotive or locomotive engine manufacturers;</P>
              <P>(2) Locomotive or locomotive engine remanufacturers;</P>
              <P>(3) Locomotive or locomotive engine owners;</P>
              <P>(4) Locomotive or locomotive engine operators; or</P>
              <P>(5) Other entities after notification to EPA.</P>
              <P>(n)(1) All locomotives that are certified to an FEL that is different from the emission standard that would otherwise apply to the locomotive or locomotive engine are required to comply with that FEL for the remainder of their service lives, except as allowed by § 92.8(a)(4)(iii) and this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) Manufacturers shall notify the purchaser of any locomotive engine that is certified to an FEL that is different from the emission standard that would otherwise apply that the locomotive or locomotive engine is required to comply with that FEL for the remainder of its service life.</P>
              <P>(3) Remanufacturers shall notify the owner of any locomotive or locomotive engine that is certified to an FEL that is different from the emission standard that would otherwise apply that the locomotive (or the locomotive in which the engine is used) is required to comply with that FEL for the remainder of its service life.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Credit generation and use calculation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For each participating engine family, NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM emission credits (positive or negative) are to be calculated according to the following equation and rounded in accordance with ASTM E29-93a, to the nearest Megagram (Mg). Consistent units are to be used throughout the calculation.</P>
              <P>(1) When useful life is expressed in terms of megawatt-hrs:</P>

              <P>Credits for each engine family are calculated as: Emission credits = (Std − FEL) × (UL) × (Production) × (Fp) × (10<E T="51">−3</E> kW-Mg/MW-g).</P>
              <P>(2) Where:</P>

              <P>(i) Std = the applicable locomotive and locomotive engine NO<E T="52">X</E> and/or PM emission standard in grams per kilowatt-hour (exceptions: Std = 0.43 g/kW-hr, for Tier 0 and Tier 1 PM line-haul credits; Std = 0.59 g/kW-hr, for Tier 0 and Tier 1 PM switch credits; and Std = previous FEL in g/kW-hr, for locomotives that were certified to an FEL other than the standard during the previous useful life).</P>
              <P>(ii) FEL = the family emission limit for the engine family in grams per kilowatt-hour. For Tier 1 and Tier 2 engine families, the FEL may not exceed the limit established in § 92.304(k) for each pollutant.</P>
              <P>(iii) UL = the sales weighted average useful life in megawatt-hours, based on the sales weighted average horsepower of the engine family (or the subset of the engine family for which credits are being calculated), as specified in the application for certification.</P>
              <P>(iv) Production = the number of locomotives or locomotive engines participating in the averaging, banking, and trading program within the given engine family during the calendar year (or the number of locomotives or locomotive engines in the subset of the engine family for which credits are being calculated). Quarterly production projections are used for initial certification. Actual applicable production/sales volumes are used for end-of-year compliance determination.</P>
              <P>(v) F<E T="52">p</E> = the proration factor as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) When useful life is expressed in terms of miles or years, the useful life in terms of megawatt hours (UL) shall be calculated by dividing the useful life in miles by 100,000, and multiplying by the sales weighted average horsepower of the engine family. Credits are calculated using this UL value in the <PRTPAGE P="508"/>equations of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The proration factor is an estimate of the fraction of a locomotive's service life that remains as a function of age.</P>
              <P>(1) The locomotive's age is the length of time in years from the date of original manufacture to the date at which the remanufacture (for which credits are being calculated) is completed, rounded to the next higher year.</P>
              <P>(2) The proration factors for ages 1 through 32 are specified in Table D305-1 of this section. For locomotives or locomotive engines more than 32 years old, the proration factor for 32 year old locomotives shall be used.</P>

              <P>(3) For replacement or repower engines, the proration factor is based on the age of the locomotive chassis, not the age of the engine.

              <SUBJECT>Certification.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In the application for certification a manufacturer or remanufacturer must:</P>

              <P>(1) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the averaging, banking, and/or trading programs. Separate declarations are required for each program (line-haul and switch) and for each pollutant (NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM).</P>
              <P>(2) Declare duty-cycle FELs for each engine family participating in certification averaging, banking, and/or trading.</P>
              <P>(i) The FELs must be to the same number of significant digits as the emission standard.</P>
              <P>(ii) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in § 92.304(k).</P>
              <P>(3) Conduct and submit detailed calculations of projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on quarterly production projections for each participating family and for each pollutant, using the applicable equation in § 92.305 and the applicable values of the terms in the equation for the specific family.</P>
              <P>(i) If the engine family is projected to have negative emission credits, state specifically the source (manufacturer/engine family, remanufacturer/engine family, or transfer) of the credits necessary to offset the credit deficit according to quarterly projected production.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the engine family is projected to generate credits, state specifically where the quarterly projected credits will be applied (manufacturer/engine family or remanufacturer/engine family, reserved or transfer).</P>
              <P>(4) Submit a statement that the locomotives or locomotive engines for which certification is requested will not, to the best of the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's belief, cause the manufacturer or remanufacturer to have a negative credit balance when all credits are calculated for all the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's engine families participating in the averaging, banking, and trading program.</P>
              <P>(b) Based on this information, each manufacturer's certification application must demonstrate:</P>
              <P>(1) That at the end of model year production, each engine family has a net emissions balance equal to or greater than zero for any pollutant and program for which participation in certification under averaging, banking, and/or trading is being sought. The equation in section § 92.305 shall be used in this calculation for each engine family.</P>

              <P>(2) That the manufacturer or remanufacturer will obtain sufficient credits to be used to comply with the emission standard for any engine family with an FEL that exceeds the applicable emission standard, or where credits will be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where credits are being obtained, for <PRTPAGE P="509"/>each engine family involved the manufacturer or remanufacturer must identify specifically the source of the credits being used (manufacturer/engine family, or remanufacturer/engine family, or transfer). All such reports shall include all credits involved in certification averaging, banking, or trading.</P>
              <P>(3) In cases where credits are being generated/supplied, each engine family must indicate specifically the designated use of the credits involved (manufacturer/remanufacturer and engine family, reserved or transfer). All such reports shall include all credits involved in certification averaging, banking, or trading.</P>
              <P>(c) Manufacturers and remanufacturers must monitor projected versus actual production throughout the model year to ensure that compliance with emission standards is achieved at the end of the model year.</P>
              <P>(d) At the end of the model year, the manufacturer or remanufacturer must provide the end-of-year reports required under § 92.309.</P>
              <P>(1) Projected credits based on the information supplied in the certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of conformity. However, any such projected credits must be validated based on review of the end of model year reports and may be revoked at a later time based on follow-up audits or any other verification measure deemed appropriate by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) Compliance for engine families using averaging, banking, or trading will be determined at the end of the model year. Manufacturers and remanufacturers that have certified engine families with credit balances for NO<E T="52">X</E> and/or PM that do not equal or exceed zero shall be in violation of the conditions of the certificate of conformity for such engine families. The certificate of conformity may be voided <E T="03">ab initio</E> for those engine families.</P>
              <P>(e) Other conditions of certification.</P>
              <P>(1) All certificates issued are conditional upon compliance by the manufacturer or remanufacturer with the provisions of this subpart both during and after the calendar year of production.</P>

              <P>(2) Failure to comply with all provisions of this subpart will be considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the certificate was issued, and the certificate may be deemed void <E T="03">ab initio.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer or remanufacturer (as applicable) bears the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the certificate was issued were satisfied or waived.</P>

              <P>(a) Manufacturer or remanufacturers must submit the certification information as required under § 92.306, and end-of-year reports each year as part of their participation in certification averaging, banking, and trading programs. All entities involved in credit trades or transfers must submit quarterly reports as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quarterly reports.</E> (1) Those holding or receiving transferred credits as allowed in § 92.303(m) must submit quarterly reports of their holdings or receipts when credits are gained or lost.</P>
              <P>(2) The reports shall include the source or recipient of the credits the amount of credits involved plus remaining balances, details regarding the pollutant, duty-cycle, and model year/Tier as well as the information prescribed in § 92.308(c). Copies of contracts related to credit trading or transfer must be included or supplied by the buyer, seller, and broker, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) End-of-year reports must include the information prescribed in § 92.308(b). The report shall include a calculation of credit balances for each family to show that the summation of the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's use of credits results in a credit balance equal to or greater than zero. The report shall be consistent in detail with the information submitted under § 92.306 and show how credit surpluses were dispersed and how credit shortfalls were met on a family specific basis. The end-of-year report shall incorporate any information reflected in previous quarterly reports.</P>
              <P>(d) The applicable production/sales volume for quarterly and end-of-year reports must be based on the location of either the point of first retail sale by the manufacturer or remanufacturer or the point at which the locomotive is placed into service, whichever occurs first. This is called the final product purchase location.</P>
              <P>(e) Each quarterly and end-of-year report submitted shall include a statement certifying to the accuracy and authenticity of the material reported therein.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Requirements for submission.</E> (1) Quarterly reports must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the calendar quarter to: Group Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group, Engine Programs and Compliance Division U.S. Environmental Protection <PRTPAGE P="511"/>Agency, 6403-J, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</P>
              <P>(2) End-of-year reports must be submitted within 120 days of the end of the calendar year to: Group Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group, Engine Programs and Compliance Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 6403-J, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.</P>
              <P>(3) Failure by a manufacturer or a remanufacturer participating in the averaging, banking, or trading program to submit any quarterly or end-of-year reports in the specified time for all engines is a violation of sections 203(a)(1) and 213 of the Clean Air Act for each locomotive or locomotive engine.</P>
              <P>(4) A manufacturer or remanufacturer generating credits for banking only who fails to submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (120 days after the end of the calendar year) may not use or trade the credits until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits pending EPA review is not permitted in these circumstances.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reporting errors.</E> (1) Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer or the remanufacturer as applicable in the end-of-year report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected 180-days subsequent to submission of the end-of-year report. Errors discovered by EPA after 180-days shall be correctable if, as a result of the correction, the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's credits are reduced. Errors in the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's favor are not corrected if discovered after the 180-day correction period allowed.</P>
              <P>(2) If EPA or the manufacturer or remanufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an end of year report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous negative credit balances may be corrected by EPA.</P>

              <P>(3) If EPA review of a manufacturer's or remanufacturers end-of-year report indicates a credit shortfall, the manufacturer or remanufacturer will be permitted to purchase the necessary credits to bring the credit balance to zero. These credits must be supplied at the ratio of 1.1 credits for each 1.0 credit needed. If sufficient credits are not available to bring the credit balance to zero for the family(ies) involved, EPA may void the certificate(s) for that family(ies) <E T="03">ab initio.</E> In addition, all locomotives and locomotive engines within an engine family for which there are insufficient credits will be considered to have violated the conditions of the certificate of conformity and therefore not covered by that certificate.</P>
              <P>(4) If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's end-of-year report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's or remanufacturer's favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the manufacturer or remanufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of the end-of-year report, the credits are restored for use by the manufacturer or remanufacturer.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(2) The locomotives audited shall be randomly selected after the remanufacture is complete. The Administrator may allow the locomotives to be selected prior to the completion of the remanufacture, where such preselection would not have the potential to affect the manner in which the locomotive was remanufactured (e.g., where the installer is not aware of the selection prior to the completion of the remanufacture).</P>
              <P>(c) The remanufactured locomotive or locomotive engine may accumulate no more than 10,000 miles prior to an audit.</P>
              <P>(d) A failed remanufactured locomotive or locomotive engine is one on which any remanufacture components are found to be improperly installed, improperly adjusted or incorrectly used.</P>
              <P>(e) If a remanufactured locomotive or locomotive engine fails an audit, then the remanufacturer must audit two additional locomotives or locomotive engines from the next ten remanufactured in that engine family by that installer.</P>
              <P>(f) An engine family is determined to have failed an audit, if at any time during the model year, the remanufacturer determines that the three locomotives audited are found to have had any improperly installed, improperly adjusted or incorrectly used components. The remanufacturer must notify EPA within 2 working days of a determination of an engine family audit failure.</P>
              <P>(g) Within 45 calendar days of the end of each quarter, each remanufacturer must submit to the Administrator a report which includes the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The location and description of the remanufacturer's audit facilities which were utilized to conduct auditing reported pursuant to this section;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any locomotive or locomotive engine that fails a production line test pursuant to § 92.510(a), effective from the time the testing of that locomotive or locomotive engine is completed.</P>
              <P>(2) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any locomotive or locomotive engine that fails an audit pursuant to § 92.511(d), effective from the time that auditing of that locomotive or locomotive engine is completed.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for <PRTPAGE P="522"/>an engine family which is in noncompliance pursuant to § 92.510(b), thirty days after the engine family is deemed to be in noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for an engine family which is determined to have failed an audit pursuant to § 92.511(f). This suspension will not occur before thirty days after the engine family is deemed to be in noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(c) If the results of testing or auditing pursuant to these regulations indicate that locomotives or engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a manufacturer or remanufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity with respect to that family for locomotives or locomotive engines manufactured or remanufactured by the manufacturer or remanufacturer at all other plants.</P>
              <P>(d) The Administrator may suspend a certificate of conformity for any locomotive or locomotive engine family in whole or in part if:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer or remanufacturer fails to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer or remanufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer or remanufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) An EPA enforcement officer is denied the opportunity to conduct activities authorized in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) An EPA enforcement officer is unable to conduct activities authorized in § 92.504 for any reason.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer or remanufacturer in writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in part; a suspension or revocation is effective upon receipt of such notification or thirty days from the time an engine family is deemed to be in noncompliance under §§ 92.508(d), 92.510(a), 92.510(b) or 92.511(f), whichever is earlier, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to any failed locomotives or locomotive engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for an engine family when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the remedy is one requiring a design change or changes to the locomotive, engine and/or emission control system as described in the application for certification of the affected engine family.</P>
              <P>(g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed locomotive or locomotive engine, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer or remanufacturer must take the following actions before the certificate is reinstated for that failed locomotive or locomotive engine:</P>
              <P>(1) Remedy the nonconformity;</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the locomotive or locomotive engine conforms to applicable standards or family emission limits by retesting, or reauditing if applicable, the locomotive or locomotive engine in accordance with this part; and</P>
              <P>(3) Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful completion of testing, or auditing if applicable, on the failed locomotive or locomotive engine, which contains a description of the remedy and test (or audit) results for each locomotive or engine in addition to other information that may be required by this part.</P>
              <P>(h) Once a certificate for a failed engine family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer or remanufacturer must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate:</P>

              <P>(1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the locomotives or locomotive engines, describes the remedy, including a description of any quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer or remanufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies will be implemented.<PRTPAGE P="523"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with the regulations of this part by testing, or auditing if applicable, locomotives or engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family. Such testing (or auditing) must comply with the provisions of this subpart. If the manufacturer or remanufacturer elects to continue testing, or auditing if applicable, individual locomotives or engines after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for any locomotive or engine actually determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards or family emission limits through testing, or auditing if applicable, in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Once the certificate has been revoked for an engine family, if the manufacturer or remanufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before the Administrator may issue a certificate for that modified family:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that the change(s) in locomotive or engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer or remanufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (g) of this section, whether subsequent testing or auditing if applicable, under this subpart will be sufficient to evaluate the change or changes or whether additional testing or auditing will be required; and</P>
              <P>(2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer or remanufacturer must demonstrate that the modified engine family does in fact conform with the regulations of this part by testing, or auditing if applicable, locomotives or engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family. When both of these requirements are met, the Administrator shall reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family. If this subsequent testing, or auditing if applicable, reveals failing data the revocation remains in effect.</P>
              <P>(j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test or audit locomotive or engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than 30 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer or remanufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests or audits have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.</P>
              <P>(k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Shall be made only after the manufacturer or remanufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with §§ 92.513, 92.514, and 92.515 and</P>
              <P>(2) Need not apply to locomotives or engines no longer in the possession of the manufacturer or remanufacturer.</P>
              <P>(l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section or voids a certificate of conformity under § 92.215, and prior to the commencement of a hearing under § 92.513, if the manufacturer or remanufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.</P>

              <P>(m) To permit a manufacturer or remanufacturer to avoid storing non-test locomotives or locomotive engines while conducting subsequent testing or auditing of the noncomplying family, a manufacturer or remanufacturer may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the following condition: the manufacturer or remanufacturer must commit to recall all locomotives or locomotive engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the family fails subsequent <PRTPAGE P="524"/>testing, or auditing if applicable, and must commit to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Number of locomotives to be tested.</E> The manufacturer or remanufacturer shall test in-use locomotives, from an engine family selected by EPA, which have accumulated between one-half and three-quarters of the engine family's useful life. The number of locomotives to be tested by a manufacturer or remanufacturer will be determined by the following method:</P>
              <P>(1) A minimum of 2 locomotives per engine family per year for each engine family that reaches the minimum age specified above provided that no locomotive tested fails to meet any applicable standard. For each failing locomotive, two more locomotives shall be tested until the total number of locomotives tested equals 10, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If an engine family has not changed from one year to the next and has certified using carry over emission data and has been previously tested under paragraph (a)(1) of this section (and EPA has not ordered or begun to negotiate remedial action of that family), then only one locomotive per engine family per year must be tested. If such locomotive fails to meet applicable standards for any pollutant, testing for that engine family must be conducted as outlined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) At the discretion of the Administrator, a locomotive or locomotive engine manufacturer or remanufacturer may test more locomotives than the minima described above or may concede failure before locomotive number 10.</P>
              <P>(c) The Administrator will consider failure rates, average emission levels and the existence of any defects among other factors in determining whether to pursue remedial action. The Administrator may order a recall pursuant to subpart H of this part before testing reaches the tenth locomotive.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Collection of in-use locomotives.</E> The locomotive manufacturer or remanufacturer shall procure in-use locomotives which have been operated for between one-half and three-quarters of the locomotive's useful life for testing under this subpart. The manufacturer or remanufacturer shall complete testing required by this section for any engine family before useful life of the locomotives in the engine family passes.</P>

              <P>(10) The statement: “In order to ensure your full protection under the emission warranty made applicable to your (locomotive or locomotive engine) by federal law, and your right to participate in future recalls, it is recommended that you have (locomotive or locomotive engine) serviced as soon as possible. Failure to do so could legally be determined to be a lack of proper maintenance of your (locomotive or locomotive engine).”</P>
              <P>(b) No notice sent pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section nor any other contemporaneous communication sent to locomotive or locomotive engine owners or dealers shall contain any statement or implication that the nonconformity does not exist or that the nonconformity will not degrade air quality.</P>

A certificate of service shall be provided on or accompany each document or paper filed with the Hearing Clerk. Documents to be served upon the Director of the Engine Programs and Compliance Division shall be mailed to: Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division 6403-J, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time.</E> (1) In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this section, except as otherwise provided, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.

              <P>(n) <E T="03">Protective orders: in camera proceedings.</E> (1) Upon motion by a party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and upon a showing by the movant that the disclosure of the information to be discovered, or a particular part thereof, (other than emission data) would result in methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets of such person being divulged, the Presiding Officer may enter a protective order with respect to such material. Any protective order shall contain such terms governing the treatment of the information as may be appropriate under the circumstances to prevent disclosure outside the hearing: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the order shall state that the material shall be filed separately from other evidence and exhibits in the hearing. Disclosure shall be limited to parties to the hearing, their counsel and relevant technical consultants, and authorized representatives of the United States concerned with carrying out the Act. Except in the case of the government, disclosure may be limited to counsel to parties who shall not disclose such information to the parties themselves. Except in the case of the government, disclosure to a party or his counsel shall be conditioned on execution of a sworn statement that no disclosure of the information will be made to persons not entitled to receive it under the terms of the protective order. (No such provision is necessary where government employees are concerned because disclosure by them is subject to the terms of 18 U.S.C. 1905.)</P>
              <P>(2)(i) A party or person seeking a protective order may be permitted to make all or part of the required showing in camera. A record shall be made of such in camera proceedings. If the Presiding Officer enters a protective order following a showing in camera, the record of such showing shall be sealed and preserved and made available to the Agency or court in the event of appeal.</P>
              <P>(ii) Attendance at any in camera proceeding may be limited to the Presiding Officer, the Agency, and the person or party seeking the protective order.</P>
              <P>(3) Any party, subject to the terms and conditions of any protective order issued pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section, desiring for the presentation of his/her case to make use of any in camera documents or testimony shall make application to the Presiding Officer by motion setting forth the justification therefor. The Presiding Officer, in granting any such motion, shall enter an order protecting the rights of the affected persons and parties and preventing unnecessary disclosure of such information, including the presentation of such information and oral testimony and cross-examination concerning it in executive session, as in his/her discretion is necessary and practicable.</P>

              <P>(4) In the submittal of findings, briefs, or other papers, counsel for all parties shall make a good faith attempt to refrain from disclosing the specific details of in camera documents and testimony. This shall not preclude references in such findings, briefs, or other papers to such documents or testimony including generalized statements based on their contents. To the extent that counsel consider it necessary to include specific details in their presentations, such data shall be <PRTPAGE P="538"/>incorporated in separate findings, briefs, or other papers marked “confidential”, which shall become part of the in camera record.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Motions.</E> (1) All motions, except those made orally during the course of the hearing, shall be in writing and shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk and served upon all parties.</P>

The movant shall, if requested by the Environmental Appeals Board or the Presiding Officer, as appropriate, serve and file reply papers within the time set by the request.</P>
              <P>(3) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon all motions filed or made prior to the filing of his decision or accelerated decision, as appropriate. The Environmental Appeals Board shall rule upon all motions filed prior to the appointment of a Presiding Officer and all motions filed after the filing of the decision of the Presiding Officer or accelerated decision. Oral argument of motions will be permitted only if the Presiding Officer or the Environmental Appeals Board, as appropriate, deems it necessary.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Evidence.</E> (1) The official transcripts and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, shall constitute the record. Immaterial or irrelevant parts of an admissible document shall be segregated and excluded so far as practicable. Documents or parts thereof subject to a protective order under paragraph (n) of this section shall be segregated. Evidence may be received at the hearing even though inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The weight to be given evidence shall be determined by its reliability and probative value.</P>
              <P>(2) The Presiding Officer shall allow the parties to examine and to cross-examine a witness to the extent that such examination and cross-examination is necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</P>
              <P>(3) Rulings of the Presiding Officer on the admissibility of evidence, the propriety of examination and cross-examination and other procedural matters shall appear in the record.</P>
              <P>(4) Parties shall automatically be presumed to have taken exception to an adverse ruling.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Interlocutory appeal.</E> (1) An interlocutory appeal may be taken to the Environmental Appeals Board either:</P>
              <P>(i) With the consent of the Presiding Officer and where he certifies on the record or in writing that the allowance of an interlocutory appeal is clearly necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense or prejudice to any party or substantial detriment to the public interest; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Absent the consent of the Presiding Officer, by permission of the Environmental Appeals Board.</P>
              <P>(2) Applications for interlocutory appeal of any ruling or order of the Presiding Officer may be filed with the Presiding Officer within 5 days of the issuance of the ruling or order being appealed. Answers thereto by other parties may be filed within 5 days of the service of such applications.</P>
              <P>(3) The Presiding Officer shall rule on such applications within 5 days of the filing of such application or answers thereto.</P>
              <P>(4) Applications to file such appeals absent consent of the Presiding Officer shall be filed with the Environmental Appeals Board within 5 days of the denial of any appeal by the Presiding Officer.</P>
              <P>(5) The Environmental Appeals Board will consider the merits of the appeal on the application and any answers thereto. No oral argument will be heard nor other briefs filed unless the Environmental Appeals Board directs otherwise.</P>
              <P>(6) Except under extraordinary circumstances as determined by the Presiding Officer, the taking of an interlocutory appeal will not stay the hearing.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Record.</E> (1) Hearings shall be stenographically reported and transcribed, and the original transcript shall be part of the record and the sole official transcript.

Such proposals shall be in writing, shall be served upon all parties, and shall contain adequate references to the record and authorities relied on.</P>
              <P>(2) The record shall show the Presiding Officer's ruling on the findings and conclusions except when his/her order disposing of the proceeding otherwise informs the parties of the action taken by him/her thereon.</P>
              <P>(t) <E T="03">Decision of the Presiding Officer.</E> (1) Unless extended by the Environmental Appeals Board, the Presiding Officer shall issue and file with the Hearing Clerk his decision within 30 days after the period for filing findings as provided for in paragraph (s) of this section has expired.</P>

              <P>(5) Oral argument will be allowed in the discretion of the Environmental Appeals Board.<PRTPAGE P="540"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Review of the Presiding Officer's decision in absence of appeal.</E> (1) If, after the expiration of the period for taking an appeal as provided for by paragraph (u) of this section, no notice of intention to appeal the decision of the Presiding Officer has been filed, or if filed, not perfected, the Hearing Clerk shall so notify the Environmental Appeals Board.</P>

Notice of the intention of the Environmental Appeals Board to review the decision of the Presiding Officer shall be given to all parties and shall set forth the scope of such review and the issue which shall be considered and shall make provision for filing of briefs.</P>
              <P>(w) <E T="03">Decision on appeal or review.</E> (1) Upon appeal from or review of the Presiding Officer's decision, the Environmental Appeals Board shall consider such parts of the record as are cited or as may be necessary to resolve the issues presented and, in addition shall to the extent necessary or desirable exercise all the powers which it could have exercised if it had presided at the hearing.</P>

              <P>(3) In those cases where the Environmental Appeals Board determines that it should have further information or additional views of the parties as to the form and content of the rule or order to be issued, the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, may withhold final action pending the receipt of such additional information or views, or may remand the case to the Presiding Officer.</P>

              <P>(y) <E T="03">Accelerated decision: Dismissal.</E> (1) The Presiding Officer, upon motion of any party or sua sponte, may at any time render an accelerated decision in favor of the Agency or the manufacturer or remanufacturer as to all or any part of the proceeding, without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence such as affidavits as he/she may require, or dismiss any party with prejudice, under any of the following conditions:</P>

              <P>(2) If under this paragraph (y) an accelerated decision is issued as to all the issues and claims joined in the proceeding, the decision shall be treated for the purposes of these procedures as the decision of the Presiding Officer as provided in paragraph (p) of this section.</P>

              <P>(3) If under this paragraph (y), judgment is rendered on less than all issues or claims in the proceeding, the Presiding Officer shall determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material <PRTPAGE P="541"/>facts are actually and in good faith controverted. He/she shall thereupon issue an order specifying the facts which appear without substantial controversy, and the issues and claims upon which the hearing will proceed.</P>
              <P>(z) <E T="03">Conclusion of hearing.</E> (1) If, after the expiration of the period for taking an appeal as provided for by paragraph (u) of this section, no appeal has been taken from the Presiding Officer's decision, and, after the expiration of the period for review by the Environmental Appeals Board on its own motion as provided for by paragraph (v) of this section, the Environmental Appeals Board does not move to review such decision, the hearing will be deemed to have ended at the expiration of all periods allowed for such appeal and review.</P>
              <P>(2) If an appeal of the Presiding Officer's decision is taken pursuant to paragraph (u) of this section, or if, in the absence of such appeal, the Environmental Appeals Board moves to review the decision of the Presiding Officer pursuant to paragraph (v) of this section, the hearing will be deemed to have ended upon the rendering of a final decision by the Environmental Appeals Board.</P>

              <P>(a) Unless otherwise specified, any person may apply for the exemptions allowed by this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, a nonconforming locomotive or locomotive engine that qualifies for a temporary exemption under this paragraph may be conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written approval for the conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission is to be under bond. The Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request for a temporary exemption from the Administrator shall contain the identification required in § 92.803 and information that demonstrates that the locomotives and or locomotive engines qualify for an exemption. Noncompliance with provisions of this section may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond and/or exportation of the locomotive or locomotive engine. The following temporary exemptions are permitted by this paragraph (b):</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exemption for repairs or alterations.</E> Upon written approval by EPA, a person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming locomotive or locomotive engine solely for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). The locomotive or locomotive engine may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of repair or alteration or shipment to the point of repair or alteration and to the port of export. It may not be sold or leased in the United States and is to be exported upon completion of the repair(s) or alteration(s).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Testing exemption.</E> A nonconforming test locomotive or locomotive engine may be conditionally imported by a person subject to the requirements of § 92.905. A test locomotive or locomotive engine may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a request is made by the appropriate importer, and subsequently granted by EPA, concerning the locomotive or locomotive engine in accordance with § 92.905 for a subsequent one-year period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Display exemptions.</E> (i) A nonconforming locomotive or locomotive engine intended solely for display may be conditionally imported under bond subject to the requirements of § 92.906(b).</P>
              <P>(ii) A display locomotive or locomotive engine may be imported by any person for purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, display of a locomotive or locomotive engine at a dealership, private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for display exemptions. A display locomotive or locomotive engine may not be sold or leased in the United States and may not be operated in the United States except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</P>
              <P>(iii) A display exemption is granted for 12 months or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Extensions of up to 12 months each are available upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption exceed 36 months.</P>
              <P>(c) National security exemption. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, a locomotive or locomotive engine may be permanently imported into the United States under the national security exemption found at § 92.908, if prior written approval for such permanent importation is obtained from the Administrator. A request for approval is to contain the identification information required in § 92.803 and information that demonstrates that the importer is entitled to the exemption.</P>

              <P>(d) An application for exemption provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be mailed to: Group Manager, Engine Compliance Programs <PRTPAGE P="543"/>Group, Engine Programs and Compliance Division U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 6403-J, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, Attention: Imports.</P>
              <P>(e) Incidental use exemption. Locomotives that are operated primarily outside of the United States, and that enter the United States temporarily from Canada or Mexico are exempt from the requirements and prohibitions of this part without application, provided that the operation within the United States is not extensive and is incidental to their primary operation.</P>

Failure to comply with this section is a violation of section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise permitted by this subpart, during a period of conditional admission, the importer of a locomotive or locomotive engine may not:</P>
              <P>(1) Operate the locomotive or locomotive engine in the United States;</P>
              <P>(2) Sell or lease or offer the locomotive or locomotive engine for sale or lease.</P>
              <P>(c) A locomotive or locomotive engine conditionally admitted pursuant to § 92.804 and not otherwise permanently exempted or excluded by the end of the period of conditional admission, or within such additional time as the Administrator and the U.S. Customs Service may allow, is deemed to be unlawfully imported into the United States in violation of section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act, unless the locomotive or locomotive engine has been delivered to the U.S. Customs Service for export or other disposition under applicable Customs laws and regulations by the end of the period of conditional admission. A locomotive or locomotive engine not so delivered is subject to seizure by the U.S. Customs Service.</P>
              <P>(d) An importer who violates section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act is subject to a civil penalty under section 205 of the Act and § 92.1106. In addition to the penalty provided in the Act and § 92.1106, where applicable, a person or entity who imports an engine under the exemption provisions of § 92.804 and, who fails to deliver the locomotive or locomotive engine to the U.S. Customs Service by the end of the period of conditional admission is liable for liquidated damages in the amount of the bond required by applicable Customs laws and regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Testing exemption.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The Administrator may exempt from the standards and/or other requirements and prohibitions of this part new locomotives or new locomotive engines that are being used solely for the purpose of conducting a test program. Any person requesting an exemption for the purpose of conducting a test program must demonstrate the following:</P>
              <P>(i) That the test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption;</P>
              <P>(iii) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; and</P>
              <P>(iv) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of oversight and control consonant with the purpose of the test program and EPA's monitoring requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each of the four elements identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, technology development, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item of information.</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under § 92.1103. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.</P>
              <P>(d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) An estimate of the program's duration; and</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum number of locomotives or locomotive engines involved.</P>
              <P>(e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) The technical nature of the testing;</P>
              <P>(2) The location(s) of the testing;</P>

              <P>(3) The time, work, or mileage duration of the testing;<PRTPAGE P="545"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the locomotives and engines involved in the testing;</P>
              <P>(5) The intended final disposition of the locomotives and engines;</P>
              <P>(6) The manner in which the locomotive or engine identification numbers will be identified, recorded, and made available; and</P>
              <P>(7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.</P>
              <P>(f) A manufacturer or remanufacturer of new locomotives or locomotive engines may request a testing exemption to cover locomotives or locomotive engines intended for use in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent two-year period. Unless otherwise required by the Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division, a manufacturer or remanufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the recordkeeping and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the locomotives or locomotive engines are used for purposes consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) For locomotives being used for the purpose of developing a fundamentally new emission control technology related either to an alternative fuel or an aftertreatment device, the Administrator may exempt the locomotive from some or all of the applicable standards of this part for the full useful life of the locomotive, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(D) The statement “This locomotive or locomotive engine is exempt from the prohibitions of 40 CFR 92.1103.”</P>
              <P>(4) No provision of paragraph (a)(3) of this section prevents a manufacturer or remanufacturer from including any other information it desires on the label.</P>
              <P>(5) The locomotive or locomotive engine is not used in revenue-generating service, or sold.</P>

              <P>(b) Display exemption. An uncertified locomotive or locomotive engine that is to be used solely for display purposes, and that will only be operated incident and necessary to the display purpose, and will not be sold unless an applicable certificate of conformity has <PRTPAGE P="546"/>been obtained for the locomotive or engine, is exempt without request from the standards of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made pursuant to § 92.905 or § 92.908, EPA determines it is appropriate to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption is to be prepared and submitted to the person requesting the exemption. The memorandum is to set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and such terms and conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and conditions generally include, but are not limited to, agreements by the applicant to conduct the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, create and maintain adequate records accessible to EPA at reasonable times, employ labels for the exempt locomotives or engines setting forth the nature of the exemption, take appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the exemption are met, and advise EPA of the termination of the activity and the ultimate disposition of the locomotives or engines.</P>

              <P>(1)(i) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, the number of locomotives to be tested shall be at least 0.15 percent of the average number of locomotives in the railroad's fleet during the previous calendar year (i.e., the number tested shall be 0.0015 multiplied by the number of locomotives in the fleet, rounded up to the next whole number).</P>
              <P>(ii) After December 31, 2015, the number of locomotives to be tested by railroads with 500 or more locomotives shall be at least 0.10 percent of the average number of locomotives in the railroad's fleet during the previous calendar year (i.e., the number tested shall be 0.0010 multiplied by the number of locomotives in the fleet, rounded up to the next whole number). After December 31, 2015, the number of locomotives to be tested by railroads with fewer than 500 locomotives shall be zero. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) apply only when:</P>
              <P>(A) No new locomotive emission standards have taken effect during the previous 5 years;</P>
              <P>(B) Locomotive emission controls have not changed fundamentally, during the previous 5 years, in any manner that could reasonably be expected to have the potential to significantly affect emissions durability; and</P>
              <P>(C) Testing during the previous 5 years has shown, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the degree of noncompliance for tested locomotives is low enough that the higher rate of testing specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is not needed.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Administrator may allow a railroad to perform a smaller number of tests than specified in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, where he/she determines that the number of tests specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section is not necessary.</P>

              <P>(iv) Locomotives tested during the previous year shall be excluded from the sample.</P>

              <P>(v) Locomotives may not be excluded from the sample because of visible <PRTPAGE P="549"/>smoke, a history of durability problems, or other evidence of malmaintenance.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Locomotives selected for testing according to the provisions of this section shall have been certified in compliance with requirements in subpart A of this part, and shall have been operated for at least 100 percent of their useful lives.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the number of locomotives that have been operated for at least 100 percent of their useful lives is not large enough to fulfill the testing requirement, locomotives still within their useful lives shall be tested. In this case, the locomotives must have been operated longer than at least 80 percent of the locomotives in the railroad's fleet.</P>

              <P>(a) See the definition of “remanufacture” in § 92.2 to determine if you are remanufacturing your locomotive or engine. (<E T="04">Note:</E> Replacing power assemblies one at a time may qualify as remanufacturing, depending on the interval between replacement.)</P>
              <P>(b) See the definition of “new” in § 92.2 to determine if remanufacturing your locomotive makes it subject to the requirements of this part. If the locomotive is considered to be new, it is subject to the certification requirements of this part, unless it is exempt under subpart J of this part. The standards to which your locomotive is subject will depend on factors such as the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Its date of original manufacture.</P>
              <P>(2) The FEL to which it was previously certified, which is listed on the “Locomotive Emission Control Information” label.</P>
              <P>(3) Its power rating (whether it is above or below 2300 hp).</P>
              <P>(4) The calendar year in which it is being remanufactured.</P>

              <P>(c) You may comply with the certification requirements of this part for your remanufactured locomotive by either obtaining your own certificate of conformity as specified in subpart C of <PRTPAGE P="551"/>this part or by having a certifying remanufacturer include your locomotive under its certificate of conformity. In either case, your remanufactured locomotive must be covered by a certificate before it is reintroduced into service.</P>
              <P>(d) If you do not obtain your own certificate of conformity from EPA, contact a certifying remanufacturer to have your locomotive included under its certificate of conformity. Confirm with the certificate holder that your locomotive's model, date of original manufacture, previous FEL, and power rating allow it to be covered by the certificate. You must do all of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Comply with the certificate holder's emission-related installation instructions.</P>
              <P>(2) Provide to the certificate holder the information it identifies as necessary to comply with the requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(e) For parts unrelated to emissions and emission-related parts not addressed by the certificate holder in the emission-related installation instructions, you may use parts from any source. For emission-related parts listed by the certificate holder in the emission-related installation instructions, you must either use the specified parts or parts certified under 40 CFR 1033.645 for remanufacturing. If you believe that the certificate holder has included as emission-related parts, parts that are actually unrelated to emissions, you may ask us to exclude such parts from the emission-related installation instructions. (<E T="04">Note:</E> This paragraph (e) does not apply with respect to parts for maintenance other than remanufacturing; see § 92.1004 for provisions related to general maintenance.)</P>
              <P>(f) Failure to comply with this section is a violation of § 92.1102(a)(1).</P>

Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty shall be by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions, any administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determining amount.</E> In determining the amount of any civil penalty assessed under this paragraph (c), the Administrator shall take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of administrator's action.</E> (i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph (c) does not affect or limit <PRTPAGE P="555"/>the Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of the Act; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this paragraph (c), or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this paragraph shall not be the subject of a civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) No action by the Administrator under this paragraph (c) shall affect a person's obligation to comply with a section of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Finality of order.</E> An order issued under this paragraph (c) is to become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this paragraph (c) may seek review of the assessment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principal place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. The person shall simultaneously send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the court within 30 days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (c) unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Collection.</E> (i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)) from the date of the final order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty is not subject to review.</P>
              <P>(ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section shall be required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to ten percent of the aggregate amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.</P>

              <P>(a) The manufacturer or remanufacturer of each locomotive or locomotive engine must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser or owner that the locomotive or locomotive engine is designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale or time of return to service following remanufacture with applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and is free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such locomotive or locomotive engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period (as determined under § 92.10).</P>

              <P>(b) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any locomotive or locomotive engine warranted under this <PRTPAGE P="556"/>part is responsible for the proper maintenance of the locomotive and the locomotive engine. Proper maintenance includes replacement and/or service, as needed, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, of all parts, items, or devices which were in general use with locomotives or locomotive engines prior to 1999. For diesel engines, this would generally include replacement or cleaning of the fuel delivery and injection system.</P>

              <SUBJECT>In-use compliance provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Effective with respect to locomotives and locomotive engines subject to the requirements of this part:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that a substantial number of any class or category of locomotives or locomotive engines, although properly maintained and used, do not conform to the regulations prescribed under section 213 of the Act when in actual use throughout their useful life period (as defined under § 92.2), the Administrator shall immediately notify the manufacturer or remanufacturer of such nonconformity and require the manufacturer or remanufacturer to submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity of the locomotives or locomotive engines with respect to which such notification is given.</P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer's or remanufacturer's plan shall provide that the nonconformity of any such locomotives or locomotive engines which are properly used and maintained will be remedied at the expense of the manufacturer or remanufacturer.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the manufacturer or remanufacturer disagrees with such determination of nonconformity and so advises the Administrator, the Administrator shall afford the manufacturer or remanufacturer and other interested persons an opportunity to present their views and evidence in support thereof at a public hearing. Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing, order the manufacturer or remanufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The manufacturer or remanufacturer shall comply in all respects with the requirements of subpart G of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer or remanufacturer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to any class or category of locomotives or locomotive engines shall be given to ultimate purchasers, subsequent purchasers (if known), and dealers (as applicable) in such manner and containing such information as required in Subparts E and H of this part.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The certifying manufacturer or remanufacturer shall furnish with each new locomotive or locomotive engine written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the engine by the ultimate purchaser as required under § 92.211.</P>
              <P>(ii) The instruction under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's using, in connection with such locomotive or locomotive engine, any component or service (other than a component or service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Such instructions also must not directly or indirectly distinguish between service performed by the franchised dealers of such manufacturer or remanufacturer, or any other service establishments with which such manufacturer or remanufacturer has a commercial relationship, and service performed by independent locomotive or locomotive engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer or remanufacturer has no commercial relationship.</P>
              <P>(iii) The prohibition of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may be waived by the Administrator if:</P>
              <P>(A) The manufacturer or remanufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the locomotive or locomotive engine will function properly only if the component or service so identified is used in connection with such engine; and</P>
              <P>(B) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public interest.</P>

              <P>(iv) In addition, the manufacturer or remanufacturer shall indicate by <PRTPAGE P="557"/>means of a label or tag permanently affixed to the locomotive and to the engine that the locomotive and/or the locomotive engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued for the purpose of assuring achievement of emission standards prescribed under section 213 of the Act. This label or tag shall also contain information relating to control of emissions as prescribed under § 92.212.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer or remanufacturer bears all cost obligation any dealer incurs as a result of a requirement imposed by paragraph (a) of this section. The transfer of any such cost obligation from a manufacturer or remanufacturer to a dealer through franchise or other agreement is prohibited.</P>
              <P>(c) If a manufacturer or remanufacturer includes in an advertisement a statement respecting the cost or value of emission control devices or systems, the manufacturer or remanufacturer shall set forth in the statement the cost or value attributed to these devices or systems by the Secretary of Labor (through the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The Secretary of Labor, and his or her representatives, has the same access for this purpose to the books, documents, papers, and records of a manufacturer or remanufacturer as the Comptroller General has to those of a recipient of assistance for purposes of section 311 of the Act.</P>

              <P>The following is an interpretive ruling set forth previously by EPA for on-highway vehicles. EPA expects to apply the same principles to locomotives.</P>
              <P>(1) The purpose of this ruling is to set forth EPA's interpretation regarding one aspect of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine manufacturer's recall liability under section 207(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7641(c)(1). This ruling will provide guidance to vehicle and engine manufacturers to better enable them to submit acceptable remedial plans.</P>
              <P>(2) Section 207(c)(1) requires the Administrator to base a recall order on a determination that a substantial number of in-use vehicles or engines within a given class or category of vehicles or engines, although properly maintained and used, fail to conform to the regulations prescribed under section 202 when in actual use throughout their useful lives. After making such a determination, he shall require the manufacturer to submit a plan to remedy the nonconformity of any such vehicles or engines. The plan shall provide that the manufacturer will remedy, at the manufacturer's expense, all properly maintained and used vehicles which experienced the nonconformity during their useful lives regardless of their age or mileage at the time of repair.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix IV to Part 92—Guidelines for Determining Equivalency Between Emission Measurement Systems</HD>
              <P>This appendix describes a series of correlation criteria that EPA considers to be reasonable for the purpose of demonstrating equivalency between two test systems designed to measure the same emissions during FTP locomotive testing. These criteria are presented here only as guidelines. When requested to make a finding of equivalency, EPA could base its decision on criteria other than those listed here, where EPA has reason to believe that these criteria are not appropriate.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General approach.</E> (1) Multiple tests should be conducted in pairs on the same locomotive or engine using each of the measurement systems.</P>
              <P>(2) Variations for other parameters, such as test fuel, should be minimized to the maximum extent possible.</P>
              <P>(3) Locomotive and/or locomotive engine tests conducted in accordance with the provisions of Subpart B of this part are preferred. Where appropriate, engine tests conducted in accordance with 40 CFR part 89 may also be used.</P>
              <P>(4) Equivalency of the systems should be determined by comparing individual modal data, individual cycle-weighted data, and the average cycle-weighted results from each system.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Correlation criteria for particulate measurements.</E> (1) The correlation coefficient (R<SU>2</SU>) for individual modal data should be 0.90, or higher.</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum deviation between any pair of cycle-weighted data should be 15 percent, or less.</P>

              <P>(3) The ratio of average cycle-weighted results using the alternate system to the average cycle-weighted results using the specified Part 92 system (i.e., avg<E T="52">alt</E>/avg<E T="52">spc</E>) should be between 0.97 and 1.05.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Correlation criteria for other measurements.</E> Correlation parameters for gaseous pollutants should be better than those specified in paragraph (b) of this appendix for particulate measurements.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Minimum number of tests.</E> The recommended minimum number of tests with each system necessary to determine equivalency is:</P>
              <P>(1) Four locomotive or locomotive engine tests, conducted in accordance with the provisions of subpart B of this part; or</P>
              <P>(2) Seven 8-mode nonroad engine tests, conducted in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 89.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Statistical outliers.</E> Statistical outliers may be excluded consistent with good engineering judgement. Outliers should be replaced by rerunning each excluded test point. Where more than one outlier is excluded, is recommended to perform one additional pair of tests (in addition to the minimum number specified in paragraph (d) of this appendix) for each two outliers excluded.</P>

              <P>(1) The implementation plan revision shall include procedures to be undertaken by MPOs, State departments of transportation, and DOT with State and local air quality agencies and EPA before making conformity determinations, and by State and local air agencies and EPA with MPOs, State departments of transportation, and DOT in developing applicable implementation plans.</P>
              <P>(2) Before EPA approves the conformity implementation plan revision required by § 51.390 of this chapter, MPOs and State departments of transportation must provide reasonable opportunity for consultation with State air agencies, local air quality and transportation agencies, DOT, and EPA, including consultation on the issues described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, before making conformity determinations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Interagency consultation procedures: General factors.</E> (1) States shall provide well-defined consultation procedures in the implementation plan whereby representatives of the MPOs, State and local air quality planning agencies, State and local transportation agencies, and other organizations with responsibilities for developing, submitting, or implementing provisions of an implementation plan required by the CAA must consult with each other and with local or regional offices of EPA, FHWA, and FTA on the <PRTPAGE P="567"/>development of the implementation plan, the transportation plan, the TIP, and associated conformity determinations.</P>
              <P>(2) Interagency consultation procedures shall include at a minimum the following general factors and the specific processes in paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) The roles and responsibilities assigned to each agency at each stage in the implementation plan development process and the transportation planning process, including technical meetings;</P>
              <P>(ii) The organizational level of regular consultation;</P>
              <P>(iii) A process for circulating (or providing ready access to) draft documents and supporting materials for comment before formal adoption or publication;</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Interagency consultation procedures: Specific processes.</E> Interagency consultation procedures shall also include the following specific processes:</P>
              <P>(1) A process involving the MPO, State and local air quality planning agencies, State and local transportation agencies, EPA, and DOT for the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Evaluating and choosing a model (or models) and associated methods and assumptions to be used in hot-spot analyses and regional emissions analyses;</P>
              <P>(ii) Determining which minor arterials and other transportation projects should be considered “regionally significant” for the purposes of regional emissions analysis (in addition to those functionally classified as principal arterial or higher or fixed guideway systems or extensions that offer an alternative to regional highway travel), and which projects should be considered to have a significant change in design concept and scope from the transportation plan or TIP;</P>
              <P>(iii) Evaluating whether projects otherwise exempted from meeting the requirements of this subpart (see §§ 93.126 and 93.127) should be treated as non-exempt in cases where potential adverse emissions impacts may exist for any reason;</P>
              <P>(iv) Making a determination, as required by § 93.113(c)(1), whether past obstacles to implementation of TCMs which are behind the schedule established in the applicable implementation plan have been identified and are being overcome, and whether State and local agencies with influence over approvals or funding for TCMs are giving maximum priority to approval or funding for TCMs. This process shall also consider whether delays in TCM implementation necessitate revisions to the applicable implementation plan to remove TCMs or substitute TCMs or other emission reduction measures;</P>
              <P>(v) Notification of transportation plan or TIP amendments which merely add or delete exempt projects listed in § 93.126 or § 93.127; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Choosing conformity tests and methodologies for isolated rural nonattainment and maintenance areas, as required by § 93.109(g)(2)(iii).</P>
              <P>(2) A process involving the MPO and State and local air quality planning agencies and transportation agencies for the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Evaluating events which will trigger new conformity determinations in addition to those triggering events established in § 93.104; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Consulting on emissions analysis for transportation activities which cross the borders of MPOs or nonattainment areas or air basins.</P>
              <P>(3) Where the metropolitan planning area does not include the entire nonattainment or maintenance area, a process involving the MPO and the State department of transportation for cooperative planning and analysis for purposes of determining conformity of all projects outside the metropolitan area and within the nonattainment or maintenance area.</P>

              <P>(4) A process to ensure that plans for construction of regionally significant projects which are not FHWA/FTA projects (including projects for which alternative locations, design concept and scope, or the no-build option are <PRTPAGE P="568"/>still being considered), including those by recipients of funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Laws, are disclosed to the MPO on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes to those plans are immediately disclosed.</P>
              <P>(5) A process involving the MPO and other recipients of funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Laws for assuming the location and design concept and scope of projects which are disclosed to the MPO as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section but whose sponsors have not yet decided these features, in sufficient detail to perform the regional emissions analysis according to the requirements of § 93.122.</P>
              <P>(6) A process for consulting on the design, schedule, and funding of research and data collection efforts and regional transportation model development by the MPO (e.g., household/ travel transportation surveys).</P>
              <P>(7) A process for providing final documents (including applicable implementation plans and implementation plan revisions) and supporting information to each agency after approval or adoption. This process is applicable to all agencies described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including Federal agencies.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Resolving conflicts.</E> Conflicts among State agencies or between State agencies and an MPO shall be escalated to the Governor if they cannot be resolved by the heads of the involved agencies. The State air agency has 14 calendar days to appeal to the Governor after the State DOT or MPO has notified the State air agency head of the resolution of his or her comments. The implementation plan revision required by § 51.390 of this chapter shall define the procedures for starting the 14-day clock. If the State air agency appeals to the Governor, the final conformity determination must have the concurrence of the Governor. If the State air agency does not appeal to the Governor within 14 days, the MPO or State department of transportation may proceed with the final conformity determination. The Governor may delegate his or her role in this process, but not to the head or staff of the State or local air agency, State department of transportation, State transportation commission or board, or an MPO.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Public consultation procedures.</E> Affected agencies making conformity determinations on transportation plans, programs, and projects shall establish a proactive public involvement process which provides opportunity for public review and comment by, at a minimum, providing reasonable public access to technical and policy information considered by the agency at the beginning of the public comment period and prior to taking formal action on a conformity determination for all transportation plans and TIPs, consistent with these requirements and those of 23 CFR 450.316(a). Any charges imposed for public inspection and copying should be consistent with the fee schedule contained in 49 CFR 7.43. In addition, these agencies must specifically address in writing all public comments that known plans for a regionally significant project which is not receiving FHWA or FTA funding or approval have not been properly reflected in the emissions analysis supporting a proposed conformity finding for a transportation plan or TIP. These agencies shall also provide opportunity for public involvement in conformity determinations for projects where otherwise required by law.</P>

              <P>(i) The transportation plan shall quantify and document the demographic and employment factors influencing expected transportation demand, including land use forecasts, in accordance with implementation plan provisions and the consultation requirements specified by § 93.105;</P>
              <P>(ii) The highway and transit system shall be described in terms of the regionally significant additions or modifications to the existing transportation network which the transportation plan envisions to be operational in the horizon years. Additions and modifications to the highway network shall be sufficiently identified to indicate intersections with existing regionally significant facilities, and to determine their effect on route options between transportation analysis zones. Each added or modified highway segment shall also be sufficiently identified in terms of its design concept and design scope to allow modeling of travel times under various traffic volumes, consistent with the modeling methods for area-wide transportation analysis in use by the MPO. Transit facilities, equipment, and services envisioned for the future shall be identified in terms of design concept, design scope, and operating policies that are sufficient for modeling of their transit ridership. Additions and modifications to the transportation network shall be described sufficiently to show that there is a reasonable relationship between expected land use and the envisioned transportation system; and</P>

              <P>(C) The year after the completion date of a regionally significant project if the project is included in the TIP or the project requires approval before the subsequent conformity determination.</P>
              <P>(ii) The conformity determination must be accompanied by a regional emissions analysis (for informational purposes only) for the last year of the transportation plan and for any year shown to exceed motor vehicle emissions budgets in a prior regional emissions analysis, if such a year extends beyond the timeframe of the conformity determination.</P>
              <P>(3) For areas that have an adequate or approved CAA section 175A(b) maintenance plan, the MPO may elect to shorten the timeframe of the conformity determination to extend through the last year of such maintenance plan after consultation with state and local air quality agencies, solicitation of public comments, and consideration of such comments.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the nonattainment area covers a smaller geographic area within an area for another NAAQS of the same pollutant, the budget test as required by § 93.118 for either:</P>
              <P>(A) The nonattainment area, using corresponding portion(s) of the approved or adequate motor vehicle emissions budgets for that other NAAQS, where such portion(s) can reasonably be identified through the interagency consultation process required by § 93.105; or</P>
              <P>(B) The area designated nonattainment for that other NAAQS, using the approved or adequate motor vehicle emissions budgets for that other NAAQS. If additional emissions reductions are necessary to meet the budget test for the nonattainment area for a NAAQS in such cases, these emissions reductions must come from within such nonattainment area;</P>
              <P>(iii) If the nonattainment area covers a larger geographic area and encompasses an entire area for another NAAQS of the same pollutant, then either (A) or (B) must be met:</P>
              <P>(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) The budget test as required by § 93.118 for the portion of the nonattainment area covered by the approved or adequate motor vehicle emissions budgets for that other NAAQS; and<PRTPAGE P="572"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) the interim emissions tests as required by § 93.119 for one of the following areas: the portion of the nonattainment area not covered by the approved or adequate budgets for that other NAAQS; the entire nonattainment area; or the entire portion of the nonattainment area within an individual state, in the case where separate adequate or approved motor vehicle emissions budgets for that other NAAQS are established for each state of a multi-state nonattainment or maintenance area.</P>
              <P>(B) The budget test as required by § 93.118 for the entire nonattainment area using the approved or adequate motor vehicle emissions budgets for that other NAAQS.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the nonattainment area partially covers an area for another NAAQS of the same pollutant:</P>
              <P>(A) The budget test as required by § 93.118 for the portion of the nonattainment area covered by the corresponding portion of the approved or adequate motor vehicle emissions budgets for that other NAAQS, where they can be reasonably identified through the interagency consultation process required by § 93.105; and</P>
              <P>(B) The interim emissions tests as required by § 93.119, when applicable, for either: the portion of the nonattainment area not covered by the approved or adequate budgets for that other NAAQS; the entire nonattainment area; or the entire portion of the nonattainment area within an individual state, in the case where separate adequate or approved motor vehicle emissions budgets for that other NAAQS are established for each state of a multi-state nonattainment or maintenance area.</P>
              <P>(3) In a nonattainment area, the interim emissions tests required by § 93.119 must be satisfied for a NAAQS if neither paragraph (c)(1) nor paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies for such NAAQS.</P>

              <P>(4) An ozone nonattainment area must satisfy the interim emissions test for NO<E T="52">X</E>, as required by § 93.119, if the implementation plan or plan submission that is applicable for the purposes of conformity determinations is a 15% plan or other control strategy SIP that does not include a motor vehicle emissions budget for NO<E T="52">X</E>. The implementation plan for an ozone NAAQS will be considered to establish a motor vehicle emissions budget for NO<E T="52">X</E> if the implementation plan or plan submission contains an explicit NO<E T="52">X</E> motor vehicle emissions budget that is intended to act as a ceiling on future NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions, and the NO<E T="52">X</E> motor vehicle emissions budget is a net reduction from NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions levels in the SIP's baseline year.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section, nonattainment areas with clean data for a NAAQS that have not submitted a maintenance plan and that EPA has determined are not subject to the Clean Air Act reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements for that NAAQS must satisfy one of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The budget test and/or interim emissions tests as required by §§ 93.118 and 93.119 as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) The budget test as required by § 93.118, using the adequate or approved motor vehicle emissions budgets in the submitted or applicable control strategy implementation plan for the NAAQS for which the area is designated nonattainment (subject to the timing requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section); or</P>
              <P>(iii) The budget test as required by § 93.118, using the motor vehicle emissions in the most recent year of attainment as motor vehicle emissions budgets, if the state or local air quality agency requests that the motor vehicle emissions in the most recent year of attainment be used as budgets, and EPA approves the request in the rulemaking that determines that the area has attained the NAAQS for which the area is designated nonattainment.</P>
              <P>(6) For the PM<E T="52">10</E> NAAQS only, the interim emissions tests must be satisfied as required by § 93.119 for conformity determinations made if the submitted implementation plan revision for a PM<E T="52">10</E> nonattainment area is a demonstration of impracticability under CAA Section 189(a)(1)(B)(ii) and does not demonstrate attainment.<PRTPAGE P="573"/>

              <P>(1) FHWA/FTA projects in CO nonattainment or maintenance areas must satisfy the hot-spot test required by § 93.116(a) at all times.

A limited maintenance plan would have to demonstrate that it would be unreasonable to expect that such an area would experience enough motor vehicle emissions growth for a NAAQS violation to occur. A conformity determination that meets other applicable criteria in Table 1 of paragraph (b) of this section is still required, including the hot-spot requirements for projects in CO, PM<E T="52">10</E>, and PM<E T="52">2.5</E> areas.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Areas with insignificant motor vehicle emissions.</E> Notwithstanding the other paragraphs in this section, an area is not required to satisfy a regional emissions analysis for § 93.118 and/or § 93.119 for a given pollutant/precursor and NAAQS, if EPA finds through the adequacy or approval process that a SIP demonstrates that regional motor vehicle emissions are an insignificant contributor to the air quality problem for that pollutant/precursor and NAAQS. The SIP would have to demonstrate that it would be unreasonable to expect that such an area would experience enough motor vehicle emissions growth in that pollutant/precursor for a NAAQS violation to occur. Such a finding would be based on a number of factors, including the percentage of motor vehicle emissions in the context of the total SIP inventory, the current state of air quality as determined by monitoring data for that NAAQS, the absence of SIP motor vehicle control measures, and historical trends and future projections of the growth of motor vehicle emissions. A conformity determination that meets other applicable criteria in Table 1 of paragraph (b) of this section is still required, including regional emissions analyses for § 93.118 and/or § 93.119 for other pollutants/precursors and NAAQS that apply. Hot-spot requirements for projects in CO, PM<E T="52">10</E>, and PM<E T="52">2.5</E> areas in § 93.116 must also be satisfied, unless EPA determines that the SIP also demonstrates that projects will not create new localized violations and/or increase the severity or number of existing violations of such NAAQS. If EPA subsequently finds that motor vehicle emissions of a given pollutant/precursor are significant, this paragraph would no longer apply for future conformity determinations for that pollutant/precursor and NAAQS.</P>

              <P>(ii) In isolated rural nonattainment and maintenance areas that are subject to § 93.118, FHWA/FTA projects must be consistent with motor vehicle emissions budget(s) for the years in the timeframe of the attainment demonstration or maintenance plan. For years after the attainment year (if a maintenance plan has not been submitted) or after the last year of the maintenance plan, FHWA/FTA projects must satisfy one of the following requirements:</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in this paragraph, the conformity determination, with respect to all other applicable criteria in §§ 93.111 through 93.119, must be based upon the most recent planning assumptions in force at the time the conformity analysis begins. The conformity determination must satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section using the planning assumptions available at the time the conformity analysis begins as determined through the interagency consultation process required in § 93.105(c)(1)(i). The “time the conformity analysis begins” for a transportation plan or TIP determination is the point at which the MPO or other designated agency begins to model the impact of the proposed transportation plan or TIP on travel and/or emissions. New data that becomes available after an analysis begins is required to be used in the conformity determination <PRTPAGE P="575"/>only if a significant delay in the analysis has occurred, as determined through interagency consultation.</P>
              <P>(b) Assumptions must be derived from the estimates of current and future population, employment, travel, and congestion most recently developed by the MPO or other agency authorized to make such estimates and approved by the MPO. The conformity determination must also be based on the latest assumptions about current and future background concentrations.</P>
              <P>(c) The conformity determination for each transportation plan and TIP must discuss how transit operating policies (including fares and service levels) and assumed transit ridership have changed since the previous conformity determination.</P>
              <P>(d) The conformity determination must include reasonable assumptions about transit service and increases in transit fares and road and bridge tolls over time.</P>
              <P>(e) The conformity determination must use the latest existing information regarding the effectiveness of the TCMs and other implementation plan measures which have already been implemented.</P>
              <P>(f) Key assumptions shall be specified and included in the draft documents and supporting materials used for the interagency and public consultation required by § 93.105.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria and procedures: Latest emissions model.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The conformity determination must be based on the latest emission estimation model available. This criterion is satisfied if the most current version of the motor vehicle emissions model specified by EPA for use in the preparation or revision of implementation plans in that State or area is used for the conformity analysis. Where EMFAC is the motor vehicle emissions model used in preparing or revising the applicable implementation plan, new versions must be approved by EPA before they are used in the conformity analysis.</P>
              <P>(b) EPA will consult with DOT to establish a grace period following the specification of any new model.</P>

              <P>(1) The grace period will be no less than three months and no more than 24 months after notice of availability is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) The length of the grace period will depend on the degree of change in the model and the scope of re-planning likely to be necessary by MPOs in order to assure conformity. If the grace period will be longer than three months, EPA will announce the appropriate grace period in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the grace period for using the MOVES2010 emissions model (and minor revisions) for regional emissions analyses will end on March 2, 2013.</P>

              <P>(c) Transportation plan and TIP conformity analyses for which the emissions analysis was begun during the grace period or before the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of availability of the latest emission model may continue to use the previous version of the model. Conformity determinations for projects may also be based on the previous model if the analysis was begun during the grace period or before the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of availability, and if the final environmental document for the project is issued no more than three years after the issuance of the draft environmental document.</P>

              <P>(1) The transportation plan, in describing the envisioned future transportation system, provides for the timely completion or implementation of all TCMs in the applicable implementation plan which are eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Laws, consistent with schedules included in the applicable implementation plan.</P>
              <P>(2) Nothing in the transportation plan interferes with the implementation of any TCM in the applicable implementation plan.</P>
              <P>(c) For TIPs, this criterion is satisfied if the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) An examination of the specific steps and funding source(s) needed to fully implement each TCM indicates that TCMs which are eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Laws are on or ahead of the schedule established in the applicable implementation plan, or, if such TCMs are behind the schedule established in the applicable implementation plan, the MPO and DOT have determined that past obstacles to implementation of the TCMs have been identified and have been or are being overcome, and that all State and local agencies with influence over approvals or funding for TCMs are giving maximum priority to approval or funding of TCMs over other projects within their control, including projects in locations outside the nonattainment or maintenance area.</P>
              <P>(2) If TCMs in the applicable implementation plan have previously been programmed for Federal funding but the funds have not been obligated and the TCMs are behind the schedule in the implementation plan, then the TIP cannot be found to conform if the funds intended for those TCMs are reallocated to projects in the TIP other than TCMs, or if there are no other TCMs in the TIP, if the funds are reallocated to projects in the TIP other than projects which are eligible for Federal funding intended for air quality improvement projects, e.g., the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program.</P>

              <P>(1) The project is included in the conforming TIP and the design concept and scope of the project were adequate at the time of the TIP conformity determination to determine its contribution to the TIP's regional emissions, and the project design concept and scope have not changed significantly from those which were described in the TIP; and</P>
              <P>(2) If the TIP describes a project design concept and scope which includes project-level emissions mitigation or control measures, written commitments to implement such measures must be obtained from the project sponsor and/or operator as required by § 93.125(a) in order for the project to be considered from a conforming program.

This criterion is satisfied without a hot-spot analysis in PM<E T="52">10</E> and PM<E T="52">2.5</E> nonattainment and maintenance areas for FHWA/FTA projects that are not identified in § 93.123(b)(1). This criterion is satisfied for all other FHWA/FTA projects in CO, PM<E T="52">10</E> and PM<E T="52">2.5</E> nonattainment and maintenance areas if it is demonstrated that during the time frame of the transportation plan no new local violations will be created and the severity or number of existing violations will not be increased as a result of the project, and the project has been included in a regional emissions analysis that meets applicable §§ 93.118 and/or 93.119 requirements. The demonstration must be performed according to the consultation requirements of § 93.105(c)(1)(i) and the methodology requirements of § 93.123.</P>

              <P>(b) This paragraph applies for CO nonattainment areas as described in § 93.109(d)(1). Each FHWA/FTA project must eliminate or reduce the severity and number of localized CO violations in the area substantially affected by the project (in CO nonattainment areas). This criterion is satisfied with respect to existing localized CO violations if it is demonstrated that during the time frame of the transportation plan (or regional emissions analysis) existing localized CO violations will be eliminated or reduced in severity and number as a result of the project. The <PRTPAGE P="578"/>demonstration must be performed according to the consultation requirements of § 93.105(c)(1)(i) and the methodology requirements of § 93.123.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Criteria and procedures: Motor vehicle emissions budget.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The transportation plan, TIP, and project not from a conforming transportation plan and TIP must be consistent with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) in the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission). This criterion applies as described in § 93.109(c) through (g). This criterion is satisfied if it is demonstrated that emissions of the pollutants or pollutant precursors described in paragraph (c) of this section are less than or equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) established in the applicable implementation plan or implementation plan submission.</P>
              <P>(b) Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be demonstrated for each year for which the applicable (and/or submitted) implementation plan specifically establishes a motor vehicle emissions budget(s), and for each year for which a regional emissions analysis is performed to fulfill the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Until a maintenance plan is submitted:</P>
              <P>(i) Emissions in each year (such as milestone years and the attainment year) for which the control strategy implementation plan revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be less than or equal to that year's motor vehicle emissions budget(s); and</P>
              <P>(ii) Emissions in years for which no motor vehicle emissions budget(s) are specifically established must be less than or equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) established for the most recent prior year. For example, emissions in years after the attainment year for which the implementation plan does not establish a budget must be less than or equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) for the attainment year.</P>
              <P>(2) When a maintenance plan has been submitted:</P>
              <P>(i) Emissions must be less than or equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) established for the last year of the maintenance plan, and for any other years for which the maintenance plan establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets. If the maintenance plan does not establish motor vehicle emissions budgets for any years other than the last year of the maintenance plan, the demonstration of consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be accompanied by a qualitative finding that there are no factors which would cause or contribute to a new violation or exacerbate an existing violation in the years before the last year of the maintenance plan. The interagency consultation process required by § 93.105 shall determine what must be considered in order to make such a finding;</P>
              <P>(ii) For years after the last year of the maintenance plan, emissions must be less than or equal to the maintenance plan's motor vehicle emissions budget(s) for the last year of the maintenance plan;</P>

              <P>(iii) If an approved and/or submitted control strategy implementation plan has established motor vehicle emissions budgets for years in the time frame of the transportation plan, emissions in these years must be less than or equal to the control strategy implementation plan's motor vehicle emissions budget(s) for these years; and<PRTPAGE P="579"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) For any analysis years before the last year of the maintenance plan, emissions must be less than or equal to the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) established for the most recent prior year.</P>
              <P>(c) Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be demonstrated for each pollutant or pollutant precursor in § 93.102(b) for which the area is in nonattainment or maintenance and for which the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission) establishes a motor vehicle emissions budget.</P>
              <P>(d) Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be demonstrated by including emissions from the entire transportation system, including all regionally significant projects contained in the transportation plan and all other regionally significant highway and transit projects expected in the nonattainment or maintenance area in the timeframe of the transportation plan.</P>
              <P>(1) Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be demonstrated with a regional emissions analysis that meets the requirements of §§ 93.122 and 93.105(c)(1)(i).</P>
              <P>(2) The regional emissions analysis may be performed for any years in the timeframe of the conformity determination (as described under § 93.106(d)) provided they are not more than ten years apart and provided the analysis is performed for the attainment year (if it is in the timeframe of the transportation plan and conformity determination) and the last year of the timeframe of the conformity determination. Emissions in years for which consistency with motor vehicle emissions budgets must be demonstrated, as required in paragraph (b) of this section, may be determined by interpolating between the years for which the regional emissions analysis is performed.</P>
              <P>(3) When the timeframe of the conformity determination is shortened under § 93.106(d)(2), the conformity determination must be accompanied by a regional emissions analysis (for informational purposes only) for the last year of the transportation plan, and for any year shown to exceed motor vehicle emissions budgets in a prior regional emissions analysis (if such a year extends beyond the timeframe of the conformity determination).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Motor vehicle emissions budgets in submitted control strategy implementation plan revisions and submitted maintenance plans.</E> (1) Consistency with the motor vehicle emissions budgets in submitted control strategy implementation plan revisions or maintenance plans must be demonstrated if EPA has declared the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) adequate for transportation conformity purposes, and the adequacy finding is effective. However, motor vehicle emissions budgets in submitted implementation plans do not supersede the motor vehicle emissions budgets in approved implementation plans for the same Clean Air Act requirement and the period of years addressed by the previously approved implementation plan, unless EPA specifies otherwise in its approval of a SIP.</P>
              <P>(2) If EPA has not declared an implementation plan submission's motor vehicle emissions budget(s) adequate for transportation conformity purposes, the budget(s) shall not be used to satisfy the requirements of this section. Consistency with the previously established motor vehicle emissions budget(s) must be demonstrated. If there are no previously approved implementation plans or implementation plan submissions with adequate motor vehicle emissions budgets, the interim emissions tests required by § 93.119 must be satisfied.</P>

              <P>(3) If EPA declares an implementation plan submission's motor vehicle emissions budget(s) inadequate for transportation conformity purposes after EPA had previously found the budget(s) adequate, and conformity of a transportation plan or TIP has already been determined by DOT using the budget(s), the conformity determination will remain valid. Projects included in that transportation plan or TIP could still satisfy §§ 93.114 and 93.115, which require a currently conforming transportation plan and TIP to be in place at the time of a project's conformity determination and that projects come from a conforming transportation plan and TIP.<PRTPAGE P="580"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) EPA will not find a motor vehicle emissions budget in a submitted control strategy implementation plan revision or maintenance plan to be adequate for transportation conformity purposes unless the following minimum criteria are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(i) The submitted control strategy implementation plan revision or maintenance plan was endorsed by the Governor (or his or her designee) and was subject to a State public hearing;</P>
              <P>(ii) Before the control strategy implementation plan or maintenance plan was submitted to EPA, consultation among federal, State, and local agencies occurred; full implementation plan documentation was provided to EPA; and EPA's stated concerns, if any, were addressed;</P>
              <P>(iii) The motor vehicle emissions budget(s) is clearly identified and precisely quantified;</P>
              <P>(iv) The motor vehicle emissions budget(s), when considered together with all other emissions sources, is consistent with applicable requirements for reasonable further progress, attainment, or maintenance (whichever is relevant to the given implementation plan submission);</P>
              <P>(v) The motor vehicle emissions budget(s) is consistent with and clearly related to the emissions inventory and the control measures in the submitted control strategy implementation plan revision or maintenance plan; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Revisions to previously submitted control strategy implementation plans or maintenance plans explain and document any changes to previously submitted budgets and control measures; impacts on point and area source emissions; any changes to established safety margins (see § 93.101 for definition); and reasons for the changes (including the basis for any changes related to emission factors or estimates of vehicle miles traveled).</P>
              <P>(5) Before determining the adequacy of a submitted motor vehicle emissions budget, EPA will review the State's compilation of public comments and response to comments that are required to be submitted with any implementation plan. EPA will document its consideration of such comments and responses in a letter to the State indicating the adequacy of the submitted motor vehicle emissions budget.</P>
              <P>(6) When the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) used to satisfy the requirements of this section are established by an implementation plan submittal that has not yet been approved or disapproved by EPA, the MPO and DOT's conformity determinations will be deemed to be a statement that the MPO and DOT are not aware of any information that would indicate that emissions consistent with the motor vehicle emissions budget will cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard; increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard; or delay timely attainment of any standard or any required interim emission reductions or other milestones.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Adequacy review process for implementation plan submissions.</E> EPA will use the procedure listed in paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section to review the adequacy of an implementation plan submission:</P>
              <P>(1) When EPA reviews the adequacy of an implementation plan submission prior to EPA's final action on the implementation plan,</P>
              <P>(i) EPA will notify the public through EPA's website when EPA receives an implementation plan submission that will be reviewed for adequacy.</P>
              <P>(ii) The public will have a minimum of 30 days to comment on the adequacy of the implementation plan submission. If the complete implementation plan is not accessible electronically through the internet and a copy is requested within 15 days of the date of the website notice, the comment period will be extended for 30 days from the date that a copy of the implementation plan is mailed.</P>

              <P>(iii) After the public comment period closes, EPA will inform the State in writing whether EPA has found the submission adequate or inadequate for use in transportation conformity, including response to any comments submitted directly and review of comments submitted through the State process, or EPA will include the determination of adequacy or inadequacy in a proposed or final action approving or disapproving the implementation plan <PRTPAGE P="581"/>under paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) EPA will publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice to inform the public of EPA's finding. If EPA finds the submission adequate, the effective date of this finding will be 15 days from the date the notice is published as established in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, unless EPA is taking a final approval action on the SIP as described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) EPA will announce whether the implementation plan submission is adequate or inadequate for use in transportation conformity on EPA's website. The website will also include EPA's response to comments if any comments were received during the public comment period.</P>
              <P>(vi) If after EPA has found a submission adequate, EPA has cause to reconsider this finding, EPA will repeat actions described in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (v) or (f)(2) of this section unless EPA determines that there is no need for additional public comment given the deficiencies of the implementation plan submission. In all cases where EPA reverses its previous finding to a finding of inadequacy under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, such a finding will become effective immediately upon the date of EPA's letter to the State.</P>
              <P>(vii) If after EPA has found a submission inadequate, EPA has cause to reconsider the adequacy of that budget, EPA will repeat actions described in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (v) or (f)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) When EPA reviews the adequacy of an implementation plan submission simultaneously with EPA's approval or disapproval of the implementation plan,</P>
              <P>(i) EPA's <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of proposed or direct final rulemaking will serve to notify the public that EPA will be reviewing the implementation plan submission for adequacy.</P>
              <P>(ii) The publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking will start a public comment period of at least 30 days.</P>

              <P>(iii) EPA will indicate whether the implementation plan submission is adequate and thus can be used for conformity either in EPA's final rulemaking or through the process described in paragraphs (f)(1)(iii) through (v) of this section. If EPA makes an adequacy finding through a final rulemaking that approves the implementation plan submission, such a finding will become effective upon the publication date of EPA's approval in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> or upon the effective date of EPA's approval if such action is conducted through direct final rulemaking. EPA will respond to comments received directly and review comments submitted through the State process and include the response to comments in the applicable docket.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for determining regional transportation-related emissions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) The regional emissions analysis required by §§ 93.118 and 93.119 for the transportation plan, TIP, or project not from a conforming plan and TIP must include all regionally significant projects expected in the nonattainment or maintenance area. The analysis shall include FHWA/FTA projects proposed in the transportation plan and TIP and all other regionally significant projects which are disclosed to the MPO as required by § 93.105. Projects which are not regionally significant are not required to be explicitly modeled, but vehicle miles traveled (VMT) from such projects must be estimated in accordance with reasonable professional practice. The effects of TCMs and similar projects that are not regionally significant may also be estimated in accordance with reasonable professional practice.</P>
              <P>(2) The emissions analysis may not include for emissions reduction credit any TCMs or other measures in the applicable implementation plan which have been delayed beyond the scheduled date(s) until such time as their implementation has been assured. If the measure has been partially implemented and it can be demonstrated that it is providing quantifiable emission reduction benefits, the emissions analysis may include that emissions reduction credit.</P>
              <P>(3) Emissions reduction credit from projects, programs, or activities which require a regulatory action in order to be implemented may not be included in the emissions analysis unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The regulatory action is already adopted by the enforcing jurisdiction;</P>
              <P>(ii) The project, program, or activity is included in the applicable implementation plan;</P>
              <P>(iii) The control strategy implementation plan submission or maintenance plan submission that establishes the motor vehicle emissions budget(s) for the purposes of § 93.118 contains a written commitment to the project, program, or activity by the agency with authority to implement it; or</P>
              <P>(iv) EPA has approved an opt-in to a Federally enforced program, EPA has promulgated the program (if the control program is a Federal responsibility, such as vehicle tailpipe standards), or the Clean Air Act requires the program without need for individual State action and without any discretionary authority for EPA to set its stringency, delay its effective date, or not implement the program.</P>

              <P>(4) Emissions reduction credit from control measures that are not included in the transportation plan and TIP and that do not require a regulatory action in order to be implemented may not be <PRTPAGE P="587"/>included in the emissions analysis unless the conformity determination includes written commitments to implementation from the appropriate entities.</P>
              <P>(i) Persons or entities voluntarily committing to control measures must comply with the obligations of such commitments.</P>
              <P>(ii) The conformity implementation plan revision required in § 51.390 of this chapter must provide that written commitments to control measures that are not included in the transportation plan and TIP must be obtained prior to a conformity determination and that such commitments must be fulfilled.</P>
              <P>(5) A regional emissions analysis for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of § 93.119 must make the same assumptions in both the “Baseline” and “Action” scenarios regarding control measures that are external to the transportation system itself, such as vehicle tailpipe or evaporative emission standards, limits on gasoline volatility, vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, and oxygenated or reformulated gasoline or diesel fuel.</P>
              <P>(6) The ambient temperatures used for the regional emissions analysis shall be consistent with those used to establish the emissions budget in the applicable implementation plan. All other factors, for example the fraction of travel in a hot stabilized engine mode, must be consistent with the applicable implementation plan, unless modified after interagency consultation according to § 93.105(c)(1)(i) to incorporate additional or more geographically specific information or represent a logically estimated trend in such factors beyond the period considered in the applicable implementation plan.</P>
              <P>(7) Reasonable methods shall be used to estimate nonattainment or maintenance area VMT on off-network roadways within the urban transportation planning area, and on roadways outside the urban transportation planning area.</P>
              <P>(b) Regional emissions analysis in serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas and serious CO nonattainment areas must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) of this section if their metropolitan planning area contains an urbanized area population over 200,000.</P>
              <P>(1) By January 1, 1997, estimates of regional transportation-related emissions used to support conformity determinations must be made at a minimum using network-based travel models according to procedures and methods that are available and in practice and supported by current and available documentation. These procedures, methods, and practices are available from DOT and will be updated periodically. Agencies must discuss these modeling procedures and practices through the interagency consultation process, as required by § 93.105(c)(1)(i). Network-based travel models must at a minimum satisfy the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Network-based travel models must be validated against observed counts (peak and off-peak, if possible) for a base year that is not more than 10 years prior to the date of the conformity determination. Model forecasts must be analyzed for reasonableness and compared to historical trends and other factors, and the results must be documented;</P>
              <P>(ii) Land use, population, employment, and other network-based travel model assumptions must be documented and based on the best available information;</P>
              <P>(iii) Scenarios of land development and use must be consistent with the future transportation system alternatives for which emissions are being estimated. The distribution of employment and residences for different transportation options must be reasonable;</P>
              <P>(iv) A capacity-sensitive assignment methodology must be used, and emissions estimates must be based on a methodology which differentiates between peak and off-peak link volumes and speeds and uses speeds based on final assigned volumes;</P>

              <P>(v) Zone-to-zone travel impedances used to distribute trips between origin and destination pairs must be in reasonable agreement with the travel times that are estimated from final assigned traffic volumes. Where use of transit currently is anticipated to be a significant factor in satisfying transportation demand, these times should <PRTPAGE P="588"/>also be used for modeling mode splits; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Network-based travel models must be reasonably sensitive to changes in the time(s), cost(s), and other factors affecting travel choices.</P>
              <P>(2) Reasonable methods in accordance with good practice must be used to estimate traffic speeds and delays in a manner that is sensitive to the estimated volume of travel on each roadway segment represented in the network-based travel model.</P>
              <P>(3) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) estimates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) shall be considered the primary measure of VMT within the portion of the nonattainment or maintenance area and for the functional classes of roadways included in HPMS, for urban areas which are sampled on a separate urban area basis. For areas with network-based travel models, a factor (or factors) may be developed to reconcile and calibrate the network-based travel model estimates of VMT in the base year of its validation to the HPMS estimates for the same period. These factors may then be applied to model estimates of future VMT. In this factoring process, consideration will be given to differences between HPMS and network-based travel models, such as differences in the facility coverage of the HPMS and the modeled network description. Locally developed count- based programs and other departures from these procedures are permitted subject to the interagency consultation procedures of § 93.105(c)(1)(i).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Two-year grace period for regional emissions analysis requirements in certain ozone and CO areas.</E> The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply to such areas or portions of such areas that have not previously been required to meet these requirements for any existing NAAQS two years from the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The effective date of EPA's reclassification of an ozone or CO nonattainment area that has an urbanized area population greater than 200,000 to serious or above;</P>
              <P>(2) The official notice by the Census Bureau that determines the urbanized area population of a serious or above ozone or CO nonattainment area to be greater than 200,000; or,</P>
              <P>(3) The effective date of EPA's action that classifies a newly designated ozone or CO nonattainment area that has an urbanized area population greater than 200,000 as serious or above.</P>
              <P>(d) In all areas not otherwise subject to paragraph (b) of this section, regional emissions analyses must use those procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section if the use of those procedures has been the previous practice of the MPO. Otherwise, areas not subject to paragraph (b) of this section may estimate regional emissions using any appropriate methods that account for VMT growth by, for example, extrapolating historical VMT or projecting future VMT by considering growth in population and historical growth trends for VMT per person. These methods must also consider future economic activity, transit alternatives, and transportation system policies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Using the motor vehicle emissions budget in the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In interpreting an applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission) with respect to its motor vehicle emissions budget(s), the MPO and DOT may not infer additions to the budget(s) that are not explicitly intended by the implementation plan (or submission). Unless the implementation plan explicitly quantifies the amount by which motor vehicle emissions could be higher while still allowing a demonstration of compliance with the milestone, attainment, or maintenance requirement and explicitly states an intent that some or all of this additional amount should be available to the MPO and DOT in the emissions budget for conformity purposes, the MPO may not interpret the budget to be higher than the implementation plan's estimate of future emissions. This applies in particular to applicable implementation plans (or submissions) which demonstrate that after implementation of control measures in the implementation plan:</P>
              <P>(1) Emissions from all sources will be less than the total emissions that would be consistent with a required demonstration of an emissions reduction milestone;</P>
              <P>(2) Emissions from all sources will result in achieving attainment prior to the attainment deadline and/or ambient concentrations in the attainment deadline year will be lower than needed to demonstrate attainment; or</P>
              <P>(3) Emissions will be lower than needed to provide for continued maintenance.</P>
              <P>(b) A conformity demonstration shall not trade emissions among budgets which the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission) allocates for different pollutants or precursors, or among budgets allocated to motor vehicles and other sources, unless the implementation plan establishes appropriate mechanisms for such trades.</P>
              <P>(c) If the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission) estimates future emissions by geographic subarea of the nonattainment area, the MPO and DOT are not required to consider this to establish subarea budgets, unless the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission) explicitly indicates an intent to create such subarea budgets for the purposes of conformity.</P>
              <P>(d) If a nonattainment area includes more than one MPO, the implementation plan may establish motor vehicle emissions budgets for each MPO, or else the MPOs must collectively make a conformity determination for the entire nonattainment area.</P>

              <P>(a) Prior to determining that a transportation project is in conformity, the MPO, other recipient of funds designated under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Laws, FHWA, or FTA must obtain from the project sponsor and/or operator written commitments to implement in the construction of the project and operation of the resulting facility or service any project-level mitigation or control measures which are identified as conditions for NEPA process completion with respect to <PRTPAGE P="592"/>local CO, PM<E T="52">10</E>, or PM<E T="52">2.5</E> impacts. Before a conformity determination is made, written commitments must also be obtained for project-level mitigation or control measures which are conditions for making conformity determinations for a transportation plan or TIP and are included in the project design concept and scope which is used in the regional emissions analysis required by §§ 93.118 (“Motor vehicle emissions budget”) and 93.119 (“Interim emissions in areas without motor vehicle emissions budgets”) or used in the project-level hot-spot analysis required by § 93.116.</P>
              <P>(b) Project sponsors voluntarily committing to mitigation measures to facilitate positive conformity determinations must comply with the obligations of such commitments.</P>
              <P>(c) The implementation plan revision required in § 51.390 of this chapter shall provide that written commitments to mitigation measures must be obtained prior to a positive conformity determination, and that project sponsors must comply with such commitments.</P>
              <P>(d) If the MPO or project sponsor believes the mitigation or control measure is no longer necessary for conformity, the project sponsor or operator may be relieved of its obligation to implement the mitigation or control measure if it can demonstrate that the applicable hot-spot requirements of § 93.116, emission budget requirements of § 93.118, and interim emissions requirements of § 93.119 are satisfied without the mitigation or control measure, and so notifies the agencies involved in the interagency consultation process required under § 93.105. The MPO and DOT must find that the transportation plan and TIP still satisfy the applicable requirements of §§ 93.118 and/or 93.119 and that the project still satisfies the requirements of § 93.116, and therefore that the conformity determinations for the transportation plan, TIP, and project are still valid. This finding is subject to the applicable public consultation requirements in § 93.105(e) for conformity determinations for projects.</P>

              <P>(e) Federal actions which are part of a continuing response to an emergency or disaster under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and which are to be taken more than 6 months after the commencement of the response to the emergency or disaster under paragraph (d)(2) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this subpart only if:</P>
              <P>(1) The Federal agency taking the actions makes a written determination that, for a specified period not to exceed an additional 6 months, it is impractical to prepare the conformity analyses which would otherwise be required and the actions cannot be delayed due to overriding concerns for public health and welfare, national security interests and foreign policy commitments; or</P>
              <P>(2) For actions which are to be taken after those actions covered by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Federal agency makes a new determination as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and:</P>

              <P>(f) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, actions specified by individual Federal agencies that have met the criteria set forth in either paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), or (g)(3) of this section and the procedures set forth in paragraph (h) of this section are “presumed to conform,” except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section. Actions specified by individual Federal agencies as “presumed to conform” may not be used in combination with one another when the total direct and indirect emissions from the combination of actions would equal or exceed any of the rates specified in paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) The Federal agency must meet the criteria for establishing activities that are “presumed to conform” by fulfilling the requirements set forth in either paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), or (g)(3) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The Federal agency must clearly demonstrate using methods consistent with this subpart that the total of direct and indirect emissions from the type of activities which would be presumed to conform would not:</P>

              <P>(3) The Federal agency must clearly demonstrate that the emissions from the type or category of actions and the amount of emissions from the action are included in the applicable SIP and the State, local, or tribal air quality agencies responsible for the SIP(s) or TIP(s) provide written concurrence that the emissions from the actions along with all other expected emissions in the area will not exceed the emission budget in the SIP.</P>
              <P>(h) In addition to meeting the criteria for establishing exemptions set forth in paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), or (g)(3) of this section, the following procedures must also be complied with to presume that activities will conform:</P>

              <P>(1) The Federal agency must identify through publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> its list of proposed activities that are “presumed to conform” and the basis for the presumptions. The notice must clearly identify the type and size of the action that would be “presumed to conform” and provide criteria for determining if the type and size of action qualifies it for the presumption;</P>

              <P>(2) The Federal agency must notify the appropriate EPA Regional Office(s), State, local, and tribal air quality agencies and, where applicable, the agency designated under section 174 of the Act and the MPO and provide at least 30 days for the public to comment on the list of proposed activities “presumed to conform.” If the “presumed to conform” action has regional or national application (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the action will cause emission increases in excess of the <E T="03">de minimis</E> levels identified in paragraph (b) of this section in more than one of EPA's Regions), the Federal agency, as an alternative to sending it to EPA Regional Offices, can send the draft conformity determination to U.S. EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards;</P>
              <P>(3) The Federal agency must document its response to all the comments received and make the comments, response, and final list of activities available to the public upon request; and</P>

              <P>(i) Emissions from the following actions are “presumed to conform”:</P>
              <P>(1) Actions at installations with facility-wide emission budgets meeting the requirements in § 93.161 provided that the State or Tribe has included the emission budget in the EPA-approved SIP and the emissions from the action along with all other emissions from the installation will not exceed the facility-wide emission budget.</P>
              <P>(2) Prescribed fires conducted in accordance with a smoke management program (SMP) which meets the requirements of EPA's Interim Air Quality Policy on Wildland and Prescribed Fires or an equivalent replacement EPA policy.</P>

              <P>(a) An action required under § 93.153 to have a conformity determination for a specific pollutant, will be determined to conform to the applicable SIP if, for each pollutant that exceeds the rates in § 93.153(b), or otherwise requires a conformity determination due to the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action, the action meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, and meets any of the following requirements:</P>

              <P>(1) For any criteria pollutant or precursor, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action are specifically identified and accounted for in the applicable SIP's attainment or maintenance demonstration or reasonable further progress milestone or in a <PRTPAGE P="604"/>facility-wide emission budget included in a SIP in accordance with § 93.161;</P>
              <P>(2) For precursors of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or PM, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action are fully offset within the same nonattainment or maintenance area (or nearby area of equal or higher classification provided the emissions from that area contribute to the violations, or have contributed to violations in the past, in the area with the Federal action) through a revision to the applicable SIP or a similarly enforceable measure that effects emissions reductions so that there is no net increase in emissions of that pollutant;</P>
              <P>(3) For any directly-emitted criteria pollutant, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meets the requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on areawide air quality modeling analysis and local air quality modeling analysis; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section and, for local air quality modeling analysis, the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
              <P>(4) For CO or directly emitted PM—</P>
              <P>(i) Where the State agency primarily responsible for the applicable SIP determines that an areawide air quality modeling analysis is not needed, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on local air quality modeling analysis; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the State agency primarily responsible for the applicable SIP determines that an areawide air quality modeling analysis is appropriate and that a local air quality modeling analysis is not needed, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, based on areawide modeling, or meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(5) For ozone or nitrogen dioxide, and for purposes of paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section, each portion of the action or the action as a whole meets any of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) Where EPA has approved a revision to the applicable implementation plan after the area was designated as nonattainment and the State or Tribe makes a determination as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section or where the State or Tribe makes a commitment as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section:</P>
              <P>(A) The total of direct and indirect emissions from the action (or portion thereof) is determined and documented by the State agency primarily responsible for the applicable SIP to result in a level of emissions which, together with all other emissions in the nonattainment (or maintenance) area, would not exceed the emissions budgets specified in the applicable SIP;</P>
              <P>(B) The total of direct and indirect emissions from the action (or portion thereof) is determined by the State agency responsible for the applicable SIP to result in a level of emissions which, together with all other emissions in the nonattainment (or maintenance) area, would exceed an emissions budget specified in the applicable SIP and the State Governor or the Governor's designee for SIP actions makes a written commitment to EPA which includes the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A specific schedule for adoption and submittal of a revision to the SIP which would achieve the needed emission reductions prior to the time emissions from the Federal action would occur;</P>

              <P>(C) Where a Federal agency made a conformity determination based on a State's or Tribe's commitment under paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section and the State has submitted a SIP or TIP to EPA covering the time period during which the emissions will occur or is scheduled to submit such a SIP or TIP within 18 months of the conformity determination, the State commitment is automatically deemed a call for a SIP or TIP revision by EPA under section 110(k)(5) of the Act, effective on the date of the Federal conformity determination and requiring response within 18 months or any shorter time within which the State or Tribe commits to revise the applicable SIP;</P>
              <P>(D) Where a Federal agency made a conformity determination based on a State or tribal commitment under paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section and the State or Tribe has not submitted a SIP covering the time period when the emissions will occur or is not scheduled to submit such a SIP within 18 months of the conformity determination, the State or Tribe must, within 18 months, submit to EPA a revision to the existing SIP committing to include the emissions in the future SIP revision.</P>
              <P>(ii) The action (or portion thereof), as determined by the MPO, is specifically included in a current transportation plan and transportation improvement program which have been found to conform to the applicable SIP under 40 CFR part 51, subpart T, or 40 CFR part 93, subpart A;</P>
              <P>(iii) The action (or portion thereof) fully offsets its emissions within the same nonattainment or maintenance area (or nearby area of equal or higher classification provided the emissions from that area contribute to the violations, or have contributed to violation in the past, in the area with the Federal action) through a revision to the applicable SIP or an equally enforceable measure that effects emissions reductions equal to or greater than the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action so that there is no net increase in emissions of that pollutant;</P>
              <P>(iv) Where EPA has not approved a revision to the relevant SIP since the area was designated or reclassified, the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action for the future years (described in § 93.159(d)) do not increase emissions with respect to the baseline emissions:</P>
              <P>(A) The baseline emissions reflect the historical activity levels that occurred in the geographic area affected by the proposed Federal action during:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The most current calendar year with a complete emission inventory available before an area is designated unless EPA sets another year; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The emission budget in the applicable SIP;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The year of the baseline inventory in the PM-10 applicable SIP;</P>
              <P>(B) The baseline emissions are the total of direct and indirect emissions calculated for the future years (described in § 93.159(d)) using the historic activity levels (described in paragraph (a)(5)(iv)(A) of this section) and appropriate emission factors for the future years; or</P>
              <P>(v) Where the action involves regional water and/or wastewater projects, such projects are sized to meet only the needs of population projections that are in the applicable SIP.</P>
              <P>(b) The areawide and/or local air quality modeling analyses must:</P>

              <P>(2) Show that the action does not:</P>
              <P>(i) Cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any area; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any standard in any area.</P>

              <P>(c) Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, an action subject to this subpart may not be determined to conform to the applicable SIP unless the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action is in compliance or consistent with all relevant requirements and milestones contained in the applicable SIP, such as elements identified as part of the reasonable further progress schedules, assumptions specified in the attainment or maintenance demonstration, prohibitions, numerical emission limits, and work practice requirements.<PRTPAGE P="606"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) Any analyses required under this section must be completed, and any mitigation requirements necessary for a finding of conformity must be identified before the determination of conformity is made.</P>

              <P>(1) For motor vehicle emissions, the most current version of the motor vehicle emissions model specified by EPA and available for use in the preparation or revision of SIPs in that State must be used for the conformity analysis as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) The EPA must publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice of availability of any new motor vehicle emissions model; and</P>

              <P>(ii) A grace period of 3 months shall apply during which the motor vehicle emissions model previously specified by EPA as the most current version may be used unless EPA announces a longer grace period in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Conformity analyses for which the analysis was begun during the grace period or no more than 3 months before the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of availability of the latest emission model may continue to use the previous version of the model specified by EPA.</P>

              <P>(c) The air quality modeling analyses required under this subpart must be based on the applicable air quality models, data bases, and other requirements specified in the most recent version of the “Guideline on Air Quality Models.” (Appendix W to 40 CFR part 51).</P>
              <P>(1) The guideline techniques are inappropriate, in which case the model may be modified or another model substituted on a case-by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific Federal agency program; and</P>
              <P>(2) Written approval of the EPA Regional Administrator is obtained for any modification or substitution.</P>
              <P>(d) The analyses required under this subpart must be based on the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action and must reflect emission scenarios that are expected to occur under each of the following cases:</P>
              <P>(1) The attainment year specified in the SIP, or if the SIP does not specify an attainment year, the latest attainment year possible under the Act; or</P>
              <P>(2) The last year for which emissions are projected in the maintenance plan;</P>

              <P>(3) The year during which the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action is expected to be the greatest on an annual basis; and<PRTPAGE P="607"/>

              <P>(a) Federal facilities and installations subject to Federal oversight can, with the approval of the State or tribal agency responsible for the SIP or TIP in that area, create an early emissions reductions credit program. The Federal agency can create the emission reduction credits in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section and can use them in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Creation of emission reduction credits.</P>
              <P>(1) Emissions reductions must be quantifiable through the use of standard emission factors or measurement techniques. If non-standard factors or techniques to quantify the emissions reductions are used, the Federal agency must receive approval from the State or tribal agency responsible for the implementation of the SIP or TIP and from EPA's Regional Office. The emission reduction credits do not have to be quantified before the reduction strategy is implemented, but must be quantified before the credits are used in the General Conformity evaluation.</P>
              <P>(2) The emission reduction methods must be consistent with the applicable SIP or TIP attainment and reasonable further progress demonstrations.</P>
              <P>(3) The emissions reductions cannot be required by or credited to other applicable SIP or TIP provisions.</P>
              <P>(4) Both the State or Tribe and Federal air quality agencies must be able to take legal action to ensure continued implementation of the emission reduction strategy. In addition, private citizens must also be able to initiate action to ensure compliance with the control requirement.</P>
              <P>(5) The emissions reductions must be permanent or the timeframe for the reductions must be specified.</P>
              <P>(6) The Federal agency must document the emissions reductions and provide a copy of the document to the State or tribal air quality agency and the EPA regional office for review. The documentation must include a detailed description of the emission reduction strategy and a discussion of how it meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) Use of emission reduction credits. The emission reduction credits created in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section can be used, subject to the following limitations, to reduce the emissions increase from a Federal action at the facility for the conformity evaluation.</P>
              <P>(1) If the technique used to create the emission reduction is implemented at the same facility as the Federal action and could have occurred in conjunction with the Federal action, then the credits can be used to reduce the total direct and indirect emissions used to determine the applicability of the regulation as required in § 93.153 and as offsets or mitigation measures required by § 93.158.</P>
              <P>(2) If the technique used to create the emission reduction is not implemented at the same facility as the Federal action or could not have occurred in conjunction with the Federal action, then the credits cannot be used to reduce the total direct and indirect emissions used to determine the applicability of the regulation as required in § 93.153, but can be used to offset or mitigate the emissions as required by § 93.158.</P>
              <P>(3) Emissions reductions credits must be used in the same year in which they are generated.</P>
              <P>(4) Once the emission reduction credits are used, they cannot be used as credits for another conformity evaluation. However, unused credits from a strategy used for one conformity evaluation can be used for another conformity evaluation as long as the reduction credits are not double counted.</P>
              <P>(5) Federal agencies must notify the State or tribal air quality agency responsible for the implementation of the SIP or TIP and EPA Regional Office when the emission reduction credits are being used.</P>

              <P>This section provides an overview of the regulatory structure of this part.</P>
              <P>(a) The regulations of this Part 94 are intended to control emissions from in-use marine engines.</P>

              <P>(b) The engines for which the regulations of this part (i.e., 40 CFR part 94) apply are specified by § 94.1, and by the definitions of § 94.2. The point at which an engine or vessel becomes subject to the regulations of this part is determined by the definitions of new marine engine and new marine vessel in § 94.2. Subpart J of this part contains provisions exempting certain engines and <PRTPAGE P="620"/>vessels from the emission standards in this part under special circumstances.</P>
              <P>(c) To comply with the requirements of this part, a manufacturer must demonstrate to EPA that the engine meets the applicable standards of §§ 94.7 and 94.8, and all other requirements of this part. The requirements of this certification process are described in subparts C and D of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) Subpart B of this part specifies procedures and equipment to be used for conducting emission tests for the purpose of the regulations of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Subparts E, F, and H of this part specify requirements for manufacturers after certification; that is during production and use of the engines.</P>
              <P>(f) Subpart I of this part contains requirements applicable to the importation of marine engines covered by the provisions of this part.</P>
              <P>(g) Subpart L of this part describes prohibited acts and contains other enforcement provisions relating to marine engines and vessels covered by the provisions of this part.</P>
              <P>(h) Unless specified otherwise, the provisions of this part apply to all marine engines and vessels subject to the emission standards of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) Marine engines and vessels may not be equipped with a defeat device.</P>
              <P>(b) An engine may not be equipped with an emission control system for the purpose of complying with emission standards if such a system will cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function.</P>
              <P>(c) You may not design your engines with emission-control devices, systems, or elements of design that cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating. For example, this would apply if the engine emits a noxious or toxic substance it would otherwise not emit that contributes to such an unreasonable risk.</P>
              <P>(d) Manufacturers shall ensure that all engines subject to the emission standards of this part are equipped with a connection in the engine exhaust system that is located downstream of the engine and before any point at which the exhaust contacts water (or any other cooling/scrubbing medium) for the temporary attachment of gaseous and/or particulate emission sampling equipment. Use good engineering judgment to locate the connection. This connection shall be internally threaded with standard pipe threads of a size not larger than one-half inch, and shall be closed by a pipe-plug when not in use. Equivalent connections are allowed. Engine manufacturers may comply with this requirement by providing vessel manufacturers with clear instructions explaining how to meet this requirement, and noting in the instructions that failure to comply may subject the vessel manufacturer to federal penalties. Vessel manufacturers are required to comply with the engine manufacturer's instructions.</P>
              <P>(e) Electronically controlled engines subject to the emission standards of this part shall broadcast on engine's controller area networks engine torque (as percent of maximum torque at that speed) and engine speed.</P>

              <P>(a) The general standards and requirements in § 94.7 and the emission standards in § 94.8 apply to each new engine throughout its useful life period. The useful life is specified both in years and in hours of operation, and ends when either of the values (hours of operation or years) is exceeded.</P>
              <P>(1) The minimum useful life is:</P>
              <P>(i) 10 years or 1,000 hours of operation for recreational Category 1 engines.</P>
              <P>(ii) 10 years or 10,000 hours of operation for commercial Category 1 engines.</P>
              <P>(iii) 10 years or 20,000 hours of operation for Category 2 engines.</P>
              <P>(iv) 3 years or 10,000 hours of operation for Category 3 engines.</P>

              <P>(2) The manufacturer shall specify a longer useful life if the engine is designed to remain in service longer than the applicable minimum useful life <PRTPAGE P="623"/>without being rebuilt. A manufacturer's recommended time to remanufacture/rebuild longer than the minimum useful life is one indicator of a longer design life.</P>
              <P>(3) Manufacturers may request in the application for certification that we approve a shorter useful life for an engine family. We may approve a shorter useful life, in hours of engine operation but not in years, if we determine that these engines will rarely operate longer than the shorter useful life. If engines identical to those in the engine family have already been produced and are in use, the demonstration must include documentation from such in-use engines. In other cases, the demonstration must include an engineering analysis of information equivalent to such in-use data, such as data from research engines or similar engine models that are already in production. The demonstration must also include recommended overhaul intervals, any mechanical warranty offered for the engine or its components, and any relevant customer design specifications. The demonstration may include any other relevant information. The useful life value may not be shorter than any of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) 1,000 hours of operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) The recommended overhaul interval.</P>
              <P>(iii) The mechanical warranty for the engine.</P>
              <P>(b) Certification is the process by which manufacturers apply for and obtain certificates of conformity from EPA, which allows the manufacturer to introduce into commerce new marine engines for sale or use in the U.S.</P>
              <P>(1) Compliance with the applicable emission standards by an engine family shall be demonstrated by the certifying manufacturer before a certificate of conformity may be issued under § 94.208. Manufacturers shall demonstrate compliance using emission data, measured using the procedures specified in Subpart B of this part, from a low hour engine. A development engine that is equivalent in design to the marine engines being certified may be used for Category 2 or Category 3 certification.</P>
              <P>(2) The emission values to compare with the standards shall be the emission values of a low hour engine, or a development engine, adjusted by the deterioration factors developed in accordance with the provisions of § 94.219. Before comparing any emission value with the standard, round it to the same number of significant figures contained in the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon request by the manufacturer, the Administrator may limit the applicability of exhaust emission requirements of § 94.8(e) as necessary for safety or to otherwise protect the engine.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements for rebuilding certified engines.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The provisions of this section apply with respect to engines subject to the standards prescribed in § 94.8 and are applicable to the process of engine rebuilding. Engine rebuilding means to overhaul an engine or to otherwise perform extensive service on the engine (or on a portion of the engine or engine system). For the purpose of this definition, perform extensive service means to disassemble the engine (or portion of the engine or engine system), inspect and/or replace many of the parts, and reassemble the engine (or portion of the engine or engine system) in such a <PRTPAGE P="624"/>manner that significantly increases the service life of the resultant engine.</P>
              <P>(b) When rebuilding an engine, portions of an engine, or an engine system, there must be a reasonable technical basis for knowing that the resultant engine is equivalent, from an emissions standpoint, to a certified configuration (i.e., tolerances, calibrations, specifications), and the model year(s) of the resulting engine configuration must be identified. A reasonable basis would exist if:</P>
              <P>(1) Parts installed, whether the parts are new, used, or rebuilt, are such that a person familiar with the design and function of motor vehicle engines would reasonably believe that the parts perform the same function with respect to emission control as the original parts; and</P>
              <P>(2) Any parameter adjustment or design element change is made only:</P>

              <P>(ii) Where data or other reasonable technical basis exists that such parameter adjustment or design element change, when performed on the engine or similar engines, is not expected to adversely affect in-use emissions.</P>
              <P>(c) When an engine is being rebuilt and remains installed or is reinstalled in the same vessel, it must be rebuilt to a configuration of the same or later model year as the original engine. When an engine is being replaced, the replacement engine must be an engine of (or rebuilt to) a certified configuration that is equivalent, from an emissions standpoint, to the engine being replaced.</P>
              <P>(d) At time of rebuild, emission-related codes or signals from on-board monitoring systems may not be erased or reset without diagnosing and responding appropriately to the diagnostic codes, regardless of whether the systems are installed to satisfy requirements in § 94.211 or for other reasons and regardless of form or interface. Diagnostic systems must be free of all such codes when the rebuilt engine is returned to service. Such signals may not be rendered inoperative during the rebuilding process.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) When conducting a rebuild, all critical emission-related components listed in Appendix I of this part not otherwise addressed by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section must be checked and cleaned, adjusted, repaired, or replaced as necessary, following manufacturer recommended practices.</P>
              <P>(2) During the installation of a rebuilt engine, all critical emission-related components listed in Appendix I of this part not otherwise addressed by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section must be checked as necessary, following manufacturer recommended practices.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 94.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Interim provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This section contains provisions that apply for a limited number of calendar years or model years. These provisions supercede the other provisions of this part. The provisions of this section do not apply for Category 3 engines.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Compliance date of standards.</E> Certain companies may delay compliance with emission standards. Companies wishing to take advantage of this provision must inform the Designated Officer of their intent to do so in writing before the date that compliance with the standards would otherwise be mandatory.</P>
              <P>(1) Post-manufacture marinizers may elect to delay the model year of the Tier 2 standards for commercial engines as specified in § 94.8 by one year for each engine family.</P>
              <P>(2) Small-volume manufacturers may elect to delay the model year of the Tier 2 standards for recreational engines as specified in § 94.8 by five years for each engine family.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Early banking of emission credits.</E> (1) A manufacturer may optionally certify engines manufactured before the date the Tier 2 standards take effect to earn emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading program. Such optionally certified engines are subject to all provisions relating to mandatory certification and enforcement described in this part. Manufacturers may begin earning credits for recreational engines on December 9, 2002.</P>

              <P>(2) Consistent with the provisions of Subpart D of this part, NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM emission credits may be generated from engines prior to the applicable effective compliance date of the applicable standard (i.e., the effective compliance date in § 94.8(a), as applicable), relative to baseline emission rates.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) THC + NO<E T="52">X</E> credits generated under this paragraph (b) shall be calculated as specified in § 92.305, except that the baseline emission rate may be either the applicable standard or a measured THC + NO<E T="52">X</E> baseline level for the configuration with the lowest NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in the applicable engine family. The additional credits resulting from using a measured baseline (instead of the applicable standard) shall be discounted by 10 percent. This discount does not apply to the portion of the credits resulting from the engine's emissions being below the applicable standard. Baseline emission rates may not exceed the IMO NO<E T="52">X</E> limits.</P>

              <P>(ii) PM credits generated under this paragraph (b) shall be calculated as specified in § 94.305, except that the applicable standard may be replaced by a measured PM baseline emission rate for the configuration with the lowest NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rate in the applicable engine family that is approved in advance by the Administrator. The additional credits resulting from using a measured baseline (instead of the applicable standard) shall be discounted by 10 percent. This discount does not apply to the portion of the credits resulting from the engine's emissions being below the applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) For post-manufacture marinizers, measured baseline emission levels may be based on emissions from a single engine for each engine family.</P>
              <P>(ii) For all other manufacturers, measured baseline emission levels must be based on the average of emissions from at least three engines for each engine family.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Administrator must approve any measured baselines in advance.</P>
              <P>(5) For an engine to be eligible to generate early credits under this paragraph (b), its certified emission levels for all pollutants must be below the Tier 2 standards listed in § 94.8, with the following exception: PMMs may include in this early credit program Category 1 marine engines with certified emissions above the Tier 2 standards listed in § 94.8. Early credits generated by Category 1 marine engines with certified emissions above the Tier 2 standards listed in § 94.8 may not be used for model year 2008 or later engines.</P>
              <P>(c) Testing of Category 1 engines subject to the requirements of this part that is conducted by the Administrator shall be performed using test fuels that meet the specifications in § 94.108 and have a sulfur content no higher than 0.20 weight percent, unless the PM emission rates are corrected for the effect of a higher fuel sulfur content.</P>

              <P>(d) Post-manufacture marinizers may import an uncertified engine for marinization, in cases where the engine in the final marinized configuration is <PRTPAGE P="626"/>not subject to the standards of this part because:</P>
              <P>(1) The model year of the marinized engine is prior to the first model year for which engines of that size are subject to the standards;</P>
              <P>(2) The post-manufacture marinizer is marinizing the engine under paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(3) The post-manufacture marinizer is granted hardship relief from the Tier 2 standards under § 94.209(c).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Compliance date of NTE requirements</E> (1) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, the requirements of § 94.8(e) for commercial marine engines start with 2010 model year engines for post-manufacture marinizers and 2007 model year engines for all other engine manufacturers.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, the requirements of § 94.8(e) for recreational marine engines start with 2012 model year engines for post-manufacture marinizers and 2009 model year engines for all other engine manufacturers.</P>

              <P>(f) Manufacturers may submit test data collected using the Annex VI test procedures to show compliance with Tier 1 standards for model years before 2007. Note: Starting in 2007, EPA may approve a manufacturer's request to continue using alternate procedures under § 94.102(c), as long as the manufacturer satisfies EPA that the differences in testing will not affect NO<E T="52">X</E> emission rates.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Flexibility for engines over 560kW.</E> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, manufacturers may choose to delay certification of marine engines with less than 2.5 liters per cylinder and rated power above 560 kW, that are derived from a land-based nonroad engine with a rated power greater than 560 kW, if they do all of the following:</P>

              <P>(1) Certify all of their applicable marine engines with less than 2.5 liters per cylinder and rated power above 560 kW to a NO<E T="52">X</E> standard of 6.4 g/kW-hr for model years 2008 through 2012.</P>
              <P>(2) Notify EPA in writing before 2004 of their intent to use this provision. This notification must include a signed statement certifying that the manufacturer will comply with all the provisions of this paragraph (g).</P>
              <P>(3) Add a permanent, legible label, written in block letters in English, to a readily visible part of each engine exempted under this paragraph (f). This label must include at least the following items:</P>
              <P>(i) The label heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.</P>
              <P>(ii) Your corporate name and trademark.</P>
              <P>(iii) Engine displacement (in liters), rated power, and model year of the engine or whom to contact for further information.</P>
              <P>(iv) The statement “THIS ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 94.12(g) FROM EMISSION STANDARDS AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS.”.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Flexibility for small-volume boat builders.</E> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, manufacturers may sell uncertified recreational engines to small-volume boat builders during the first five years for which the emission standards in § 94.8 apply, subject to the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(1) The U.S.-directed production volume of boats from any small-volume boat builder using uncertified engines during the total five-year period may not exceed 80 percent of the manufacturer's average annual production for the three years prior to the general applicability of the recreational engine standards in § 94.8, except as allowed in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Small-volume boat builders may exceed the production limits in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, provided they do not exceed 20 boats during the five-year period or 10 boats in any single calendar year. This does not apply to boats powered by engines with displacement greater than 2.5 liters per cylinder.</P>

              <P>(3) Small-volume boat builders must keep records of all the boats and engines produced under this paragraph (h), including boat and engine model numbers, serial numbers, and dates of manufacture. Records must also include information verifying compliance with the limits in paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section. Keep these records until at least two full years after you no longer use the provisions in this paragraph (h).<PRTPAGE P="627"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Manufacturers must add a permanent, legible label, written in block letters in English, to a readily visible part of each engine exempted under this paragraph (h).</P>
              <P>This label must include at least the following items:</P>
              <P>(i) The label heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.</P>
              <P>(ii) Your corporate name and trademark.</P>
              <P>(iii) Engine displacement (in liters), rated power, and model year of the engine or whom to contact for further information.</P>
              <P>(iv) The statement “THIS ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 94.12(h)</P>
              <P>FROM EMISSION STANDARDS AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS.”.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Early use of future provisions.</E> For model years 2009 through 2013, certain marine engines will be subject to the requirements of this part 94 while others will be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 1042. Manufacturers may ask for flexibility in making the transition to the new regulations as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) You may ask to use a combination of the test procedures of this part and those of 40 CFR part 1042. This might include the early use of the duty cycles and NTE specifications that apply for Tier 3 or Tier 4 engines. We will approve your request only if you show us that it does not affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards. This generally requires that the combined procedures would result in emission measurements at least as high as those that would be measured using the procedures specified in this part. Alternatively, you may demonstrate that the combined effects of the procedures is small relative to your compliance margin (the degree to which your engines are below the applicable standards).</P>
              <P>(2) You may ask to comply with the administrative requirements of 40 CFR parts 1042 and 1068 instead of the equivalent requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Transition to new category thresholds.</E> Beginning model year 2012, engines with maximum engine power at or below 3700 kW with per-cylinder displacement at or above 5.0 liters and below 7.0 liters are Category 1 engines subject to 40 CFR part 1042. Similarly, beginning model year 2014, engines with maximum engine power above 3700 kW with per-cylinder displacement at or above 5.0 liters and below 7.0 liters are Category 1 engines subject to 40 CFR part 1042. For purposes of this paragraph (j), maximum engine power has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1042.901.</P>

              <P>This section describes the test procedures for supplemental testing conducted to determine compliance with the exhaust emission requirements of § 94.8(e)(1). In general, the supplemental test procedures are the same as those otherwise specified by this subpart, except that they cover any speeds, loads, ambient conditions, and operating parameters that may be experienced in use. The test procedures specified by other sections in this subpart also apply to these tests, except as specified in this section.</P>
              <P>(a) Notwithstanding other provisions of this subpart, testing conducted to determine compliance with the exhaust emission requirements of § 94.8(e) may be conducted:</P>
              <P>(1) At any speed and load (or any combination of speeds and loads that is nominally steady-state) within the applicable Not To Exceed Zone specified in paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Without correction, at any intake air temperature between 13 °C and 35 °C (or between 13 °C and 30 °C for engines not drawing intake air directly from a space that could be heated by the engine);</P>
              <P>(ii) Without correction at any ambient water temperature (or equivalent) between 5 °C and 27 °C;</P>
              <P>(iii) Without correction at any ambient humidity between 7.1 and 10.7 grams of moisture per kilogram of dry air; and</P>
              <P>(3) With a continuous sampling period not less than 30 seconds in duration.</P>
              <P>(b) The specified Not to Exceed Zones for marine engines are defined as follows. These Not to Exceed Zones apply, unless a modified zone is established under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) For commercial Category 1 engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 94.105(b), the Not to Exceed zones are defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The Not to Exceed zone is the region between the curves power = 1.15 × SPD<SU>2</SU> and power = 0.85 × SPD<SU>4</SU>, excluding all operation below 25% of maximum power at rated speed and excluding all operation below 63% of maximum test speed.</P>
              <P>(ii) This zone is divided into two subzones, one above and one below 45% of maximum power at rated speed.</P>
              <P>(iii) SPD in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section refers to percent of maximum test speed.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> This section specifies how to determine maximum test speed from a lug curve. This maximum test speed is used in §§ 94.105, 94.106, and § 94.109 (including the tolerances for engine speed specified in § 94.105).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Generation of lug curve.</E> Prior to beginning emission testing, generate maximum measured brakepower versus engine speed data points using the applicable method specified in 40 CFR 1065.510. These data points form the lug curve. It is not necessary to generate the entire lug curve. For the portion of the curve where power increases with increasing speed, it is not necessary to generate points with power less than 90 percent of the maximum power value. For the portion of the curve where power decreases with increasing speed, it is not necessary to generate points with power less than 75 percent of the maximum power value.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Normalization of lug curve.</E> (1) Identify the point (power and speed) on the lug curve at which maximum power occurs.</P>
              <P>(2) Normalize the power values of the lug curve by dividing them by the maximum power value identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and multiplying the resulting values by 100.</P>
              <P>(3) Normalize the engine speed values of the lug curve by dividing them by the speed at which maximum power occurs, which is identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and multiplying the resulting values by 100.</P>
              <P>(4) Maximum engine power is located on the normalized lug curve at 100 percent power and 100 percent speed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of maximum test speed.</E> Calculate the maximum test speed from the speedfactor analysis described in this paragraph (d).</P>
              <P>(1) For a given combination of engine power and speed (i.e., a given power/speed point), the speedfactor is the distance to the normalized power/speed point from the zero power, zero speed point. The value of the speedfactor is defined as:</P>

              </GPH>
              <P>(2) Calculate speedfactors for the power/speed data points on the lug curve, and determine the maximum value.</P>
              <P>(3) Maximum test speed is the speed at which the maximum value for the speedfactor occurs.</P>
              <P>(e) For constant-speed engines, rated speed is the maximum test speed.</P>

              <P>(f) For Category 3 engines, manufacturers may choose to set the maximum <PRTPAGE P="637"/>test speed at the maximum in-use engine speed instead of the speed specified in § 94.107(d).</P>

              <P>(c) The Administrator may require that adjustable parameters be set to any specification within its adjustable range for certification, selective enforcement audit, or in-use testing to determine compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) In specifying the adjustable range of each adjustable parameter on a new engine, the manufacturer, shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Ensure that safe engine operating characteristics are available within that range, as required by section 202(a)(4) of the Clean Air Act, taking into consideration the production tolerances; and</P>

              <P>(f) For Category 3 marine engines, manufacturers must specify in the maintenance instructions how to adjust the engines to achieve emission performance equivalent to the performance demonstrated under the certification test conditions. This must address all necessary adjustments, including those required to address differences in fuel quality or ambient temperatures. For example, equivalent emissions performance can be measured relative to optimal engine performance that could be achieved in the absence of emission standards (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the calibration that result in the lowest fuel consumption and/or maximum firing pressure). In this example, adjustments that achieved the same percent reduction in NO<E T="52">X</E> emissions from the optimal calibration would be considered to be equivalent. Alternatively, if the engine uses injection timing retard and EGR to reduce emissions, then retarding timing the same number of degrees (relative to optimal engine performance) and using the same rate of EGR at the different conditions would be considered to be equivalent.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) The manufacturer must provide in boldface type on the first page of the written maintenance instructions notice that maintenance, replacement, or repair of the emission control devices <PRTPAGE P="647"/>and systems may be performed by any engine repair establishment or individual.</P>
              <P>(2) The instructions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's or owner's using, in connection with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Such instructions also will not directly or indirectly distinguish between service performed by any other service establishments with which such manufacturer has a commercial relationship and service performed by independent vessel or engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer has no commercial relationship.</P>
              <P>(3) The prohibition of paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be waived by the Administrator if:</P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the engine will function properly only if the component or service so identified is used in connection with such engine; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(c) The manufacturer shall provide to the Administrator, no later than the time of the submission required by § 94.203, a copy of the emission-related maintenance instructions that the manufacturer proposes to supply to the ultimate purchaser or owner in accordance with this section. The Administrator will review such instructions to determine whether they are reasonable and necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the engine's emission control systems. If the Administrator determines that such instructions are not reasonable and necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the emission control systems, he/she may disapprove the application for certification or may require that the manufacturer modify the instructions.</P>
              <P>(d) Any revision to the maintenance instructions which will affect emissions shall be supplied to the Administrator at least 30 days before being supplied to the ultimate purchaser or owner unless the Administrator consents to a lesser period of time, and is subject to the provisions of § 94.210.</P>
              <P>(e) This paragraph (e) specifies emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of obtaining durability data for marine engines. The maintenance intervals specified in this paragraph are minimum intervals.</P>
              <P>(1) All emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of obtaining durability data must occur at the same or longer hours of use intervals as those specified in the manufacturer's maintenance instructions furnished to the ultimate purchaser of the engine under paragraph (a) of this section. This maintenance schedule may be updated as necessary throughout the testing of the engine, provided that no maintenance operation is deleted from the maintenance schedule after the operation has been performed on the test equipment or engine.</P>
              <P>(2) Any emission-related maintenance which is performed on equipment, engines, subsystems, or components must be technologically necessary to ensure in-use compliance with the emission standards. The manufacturer must submit data which demonstrate to the Administrator that all of the emission-related scheduled maintenance which is to be performed is technologically necessary. Scheduled maintenance must be approved by the Administrator prior to being performed or being included in the emission-related maintenance instructions provided to the purchasers under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) The Administrator may require longer maintenance intervals than those listed in paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section where the listed intervals are not technologically necessary.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Administrator may allow manufacturers to specify shorter maintenance intervals than those listed in paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section where technologically necessary for Category 2 engines.</P>
              <P>(iii) The maintenance intervals listed in paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section do not apply for Category 3.</P>

              <P>(3) The adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of items listed in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(iii) of this <PRTPAGE P="648"/>section shall occur at 1,500 hours of use and at 1,500-hour intervals thereafter.</P>

              <P>(vi) Catalytic convertor.</P>
              <P>(vii) Any other add-on emission-related component (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a component whose sole or primary purpose is to reduce emissions or whose failure will significantly degrade emission control and whose function is not integral to the design and performance of the engine).</P>

              <P>(f) Scheduled maintenance not related to emissions which is reasonable and technologically necessary (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> oil change, oil filter change, fuel filter change, air filter change, cooling system maintenance, adjustment of idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, injector lash, timing, lubrication of the exhaust manifold heat control valve, etc.) may be performed on durability engines at the least frequent intervals recommended by the manufacturer to the ultimate purchaser, (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> not the intervals recommended for severe service).</P>
              <P>(g) Adjustment of engine idle speed on emission data engines may be performed once before the low-hour emission test point. Any other engine, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on emission data vehicles shall be performed only with advance approval of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(h) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, equipment, instruments, or tools may not be used to identify malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools will be available to dealerships and other service outlets and are:</P>
              <P>(1) Used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such components; or</P>
              <P>(2) Used subsequent to the identification of an engine malfunction, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section for emission data engines; or</P>
              <P>(3) Specifically authorized by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(i) All test data, maintenance reports, and required engineering reports shall be compiled and provided to the Administrator in accordance with § 94.215.</P>
              <P>(j)(1) The components listed in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (j)(1)(vi) of this section are defined as critical emission-related components.</P>
              <P>(i) Catalytic convertor.</P>
              <P>(ii) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors and actuators.</P>
              <P>(iii) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related filters, coolers, control valves, and tubing).</P>
              <P>(iv) Positive crankcase ventilation valve.</P>
              <P>(v) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system.</P>
              <P>(vi) Any other add-on emission-related component (i.e., a component whose sole or primary purpose is to reduce emissions or whose failure will significantly degrade emission control and whose function is not integral to the design and performance of the engine).</P>

              <P>(2) All critical emission-related scheduled maintenance must have a reasonable likelihood of being performed in use. For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, the manufacturer must show the reasonable likelihood of such maintenance being performed in-use. Critical emission-related scheduled maintenance items which satisfy <PRTPAGE P="649"/>one of the conditions defined in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (j)(2)(vi) of this section will be accepted as having a reasonable likelihood of being performed in use.</P>
              <P>(i) Data are presented which establish for the Administrator a connection between emissions and engine performance such that as emissions increase due to lack of maintenance, vehicle performance will simultaneously deteriorate to a point unacceptable for typical operation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Survey data are submitted which adequately demonstrate to the Administrator with an 80 percent confidence level that 80 percent of such engines already have this critical maintenance item performed in-use at the recommended interval(s).</P>
              <P>(iii) A clearly displayed visible signal system approved by the Administrator is installed to alert the equipment operator that maintenance is due. A signal bearing the message “maintenance needed” or “check engine,” or a similar message approved by the Administrator, shall be actuated at the appropriate usage point or by component failure. This signal must be continuous while the engine is in operation and not be easily eliminated without performance of the required maintenance. Resetting the signal shall be a required step in the maintenance operation. The method for resetting the signal system shall be approved by the Administrator. The system must not be designed to deactivate upon the end of the useful life of the engine or thereafter.</P>
              <P>(iv) A manufacturer may desire to demonstrate through a survey that a critical maintenance item is likely to be performed without a visible signal on a maintenance item for which there is no prior in-use experience without the signal. To that end, the manufacturer may in a given model year market up to 200 randomly selected engines per critical emission-related maintenance item without such visible signals, and monitor the performance of the critical maintenance item by the owners to show compliance with paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section. This option is restricted to two consecutive model years and may not be repeated until any previous survey has been completed. If the critical maintenance involves more than one engine family, the sample will be sales weighted to ensure that it is representative of all the families in question.</P>
              <P>(v) The manufacturer provides the maintenance free of charge, and clearly informs the customer that the maintenance is free in the instructions provided under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) The manufacturer uses any other method which the Administrator approves as establishing a reasonable likelihood that the critical maintenance will be performed in-use.</P>
              <P>(3) Visible signal systems used under paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section are considered an element of design of the emission control system. Therefore, disabling, resetting, or otherwise rendering such signals inoperative without also performing the indicated maintenance procedure is a prohibited act.</P>
              <P>(k) For Category 3 engines, the manufacturer must provide the ultimate purchaser with a Technical File meeting the specifications of section 2.4 of the Annex VI Technical Code (incorporated by reference in § 94.5). The maintenance instructions required by this part to be provided by manufacturer may be included in this Technical File. The manufacturer must provide a copy of this Technical File to EPA upon request.</P>
              <P>(l) Owners and operators of Category 3 engines shall transfer the maintenance instructions to subsequent owners and operators of the engine upon sale or transfer of the engine or vessel.</P>

              <P>(i) Any facility where any such tests or any procedures or activities connected with such test are or were performed;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any facility where any engine which is being tested (or was tested, or is to be tested) is present;</P>
              <P>(iii) Any facility where any construction process or assembly process used in the modification or buildup of such an engine into a certification engine is taking place or has taken place; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Any facility where any record or other document relating to any of the activities listed in this paragraph (d)(1).</P>
              <P>(2) Upon admission to any facility referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, any EPA Enforcement Officer shall be allowed:</P>
              <P>(i) To inspect and monitor any part or aspect of such procedures, activities and testing facilities including, but not limited to, monitoring engine preconditioning, emissions tests, service accumulation, maintenance, and engine storage procedures, and to verify correlation or calibration of test equipment;</P>
              <P>(ii) To inspect and make copies of any such records, designs, or other documents, including those records specified in Subpart D of this part; and</P>

              <P>(iv) To inspect and make copies of any records and documents specified in this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Any EPA Enforcement Officer shall be furnished by those in charge of a facility being inspected with such reasonable assistance as he/she may request to help him/her discharge any function listed in this part. Each applicant for or recipient of certification is required to cause those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to furnish such reasonable assistance without charge to EPA whether or not the applicant controls the facility.</P>
              <P>(6) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement Officer applies to any facility involved in the manufacturing or assembling of engines, whether or not the manufacturer owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to domestic and to foreign manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to do what is necessary to insure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no informed judgment that an engine is certifiable or is covered by a certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to locate its testing and manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not arise.</P>
              <P>(7) For purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) “Presentation of credentials” shall mean display of the document designating a person as an EPA Enforcement Officer.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where component or engine storage areas or facilities are concerned, “operating hours” shall mean all times during which personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of the area or facility and have access to it.</P>
              <P>(iii) Where facilities or areas other than those covered by paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section are concerned, “operating hours” shall mean all times during which an assembly line is in operation or all times during which testing, maintenance, service accumulation, production or compilation of records, or any other procedure or activity related to certification testing, to translation of designs from the test stage to the production stage, or to engine manufacture, or assembly is being carried out in a facility.</P>

              <P>(iv) “Reasonable assistance” includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services, the making available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer of how the facility operates and to answer his questions, and the performance on request of emissions tests on any engine which is being, has been, or will be used for certification testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may require appropriate service accumulation. A manufacturer may be compelled to cause the personal appearance of any employee at such a facility before an EPA Enforcement Officer by written request for his appearance, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, served on the manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel.<PRTPAGE P="654"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) Any entry without 24 hour prior written or oral notification to the affected manufacturer shall be authorized in writing by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.</P>
              <P>(8) EPA may void a certificate of conformity <E T="03">ab initio</E> for engines introduced into commerce if the manufacturer (or contractor for the manufacturer, if applicable) fails to comply with any provision of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Emission data engine selection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The manufacturer must select for testing, from each engine family, the engine configuration which is expected to be worst-case for exhaust emission compliance on in-use engines, considering all exhaust emission constituents and the range of installation options available to vessel builders. The engines selected for testing are collectively described as the test fleet.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deterioration factor determination.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Manufacturers shall determine exhaust emission deterioration factors using good engineering judgement according to the provisions of this section. Every deterioration factor must be, in the Administrator's judgment, consistent with emissions increases observed in-use based on emission testing of similar engines. Deterioration factors that predict emission increases over the useful life of an engine that are significantly less than the emission increases over the useful life observed from in-use testing of similar engines shall not be used.</P>
              <P>(a) A separate exhaust emission deterioration factor shall be established for each engine family and for each emission constituent applicable to that family.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Calculation procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">For engines not utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., catalyst).</E> For each applicable emission constituent, an additive deterioration factor shall be used; that is, a deterioration factor that when added to the low mileage emission rate equals the emission rate at the end of useful life. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than zero, it shall be zero for the purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">For engines utilizing aftertreatment technology (e.g., catalyst).</E> For each applicable emission constituent, a multiplicative deterioration factor shall be used; that is deterioration factors that <PRTPAGE P="656"/>when multiplied by the low mileage emission rate equal the emission rate at the end of useful life. However, if the deterioration factor supplied by the manufacturer is less than one, it shall be one for the purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rounding.</E> (1) In the case of a multiplicative exhaust emission deterioration factor, round the factor to three places to the right of the decimal point.</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of an additive exhaust emission deterioration factor, round the factor shall to at least two places to the right of the decimal point.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) Except as allowed by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the manufacturer shall determine the deterioration factors for Category 1 and Category 2 engines based on service accumulation and related testing, according to the manufacturer's procedures, and the provisions of §§ 94.219 and 94.220.

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Carryover and carryacross of durability emission data.</E> In lieu of testing an emission data or durability data engine selected under § 94.217 or § 94.219, and submitting the resulting data, a manufacturer may, with Administrator approval, use exhaust emission deterioration data on a similar engine for which certification to the same standard has previously been obtained or for which all applicable data required under this subpart have previously been submitted. These data must be submitted in the application for certification.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Use of non-marine deterioration data.</E> In the case where a manufacturer produces a certified motor vehicle engine, locomotive engine, or other nonroad engine that is similar to the marine engine to be certified, deterioration data from the non-marine engine may be applied to the marine engine. This application of deterioration data from such an engine to a marine engine is subject to Administrator approval, and the determination of whether the engines are similar shall be based on good engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Engineering analysis for established technologies.</E> In the case where an engine family uses technology which is well established, an analysis based on good engineering practices may be used in lieu of testing to determine a deterioration factor for that engine family. Engines using exhaust gas recirculation or aftertreatment are excluded from this provision. The manufacturer shall provide a written statement to the Administrator that all data, analyses, test procedures, evaluations, and other documents, on which the deterioration factor is based, are available to the Administrator upon request.</P>

              <P>(b) An engine family is eligible to participate in the certification averaging, banking, and trading program for THC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM emissions only if it is subject to regulation under this part with certain exceptions specified in paragraph (c) of this section. No averaging, banking, and trading program is available for meeting the CO standards of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) Engines may not participate in the certification averaging, banking, and trading program if they are exported. Only engines certified under this part are eligible for generation or use of credits in this certification averaging, banking, and trading program. Engines certified to the Blue Sky provisions of § 94.8(f) are not eligible for inclusion in this certification averaging, banking, and trading program.</P>
              <P>(d) Averaging involves the generation of credits by a manufacturer for use by that same manufacturer in the same calendar year. A manufacturer may use averaging during certification to offset an emission exceedance of an engine family caused by an FEL above the applicable emission standard, subject to the provisions of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(e) Banking involves the generation of credits by a manufacturer in a given calendar year for use in a subsequent model year. A manufacturer may bank actual credits only after the end of the calendar year and after EPA has reviewed the manufacturer's end-of-year reports. During the calendar year and before submittal of the end-of-year report, credits originally designated in the certification process for banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for trading or averaging in the end-of-year report. Credits declared for banking from the previous calendar year that have not been reviewed by EPA may be used in averaging or trading transactions. However, such credits may be revoked at a later time following EPA review of the end-of-year report or any subsequent audit actions.<PRTPAGE P="659"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) Trading involves the sale of banked credits for use in certification of new engines under this part. Only banked credits may be traded; reserved credits may not be traded.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance requirements.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Manufacturers wishing to participate in certification averaging, banking and trading programs shall select a FEL for each engine family they wish to include. The level of the FEL shall be selected by the manufacturer, subject to the upper limits described in paragraph (m) of this section. An engine family certified to an FEL is subject to all provisions specified in this part, except that the applicable FEL replaces the applicable THC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM emission standard for the family participating in the averaging, banking, and trading program.</P>
              <P>(b) A manufacturer may certify one or more engine families at FELs above or below the applicable emission standard, provided the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance of all credit transactions in a given calendar year is greater than or equal to zero, as calculated for each family under § 94.305 and reported under § 94.309.</P>
              <P>(c) Manufacturers certifying engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable emission standard shall obtain emission credits in amounts sufficient to address the shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, banking, or trading, subject to the restrictions described in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) Manufacturers certifying engine families with FELs below the applicable emission standard may generate emission credits to average, bank, or trade, or a combination thereof.</P>
              <P>(e) An engine family may not generate credits for one pollutant while also using credits for another pollutant in the same model year.</P>
              <P>(f) Credits may only be used for certification; they may not be used to remedy a violation of the FEL determined by production line or in-use testing. Credits may be used to allow subsequent production of engines for an engine family failing production line testing if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.</P>
              <P>(g) [Reserved].</P>
              <P>(h) If an FEL is changed after initial certification in any given model year, the manufacturer must conduct production line testing to verify that the emission levels are achieved, with one exception: when an FEL is changed immediately after (and because of) a production line testing failure, additional verification testing is not required.</P>

              <P>(i) Manufacturers participating in the averaging, banking and trading program must demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards at the end of the model year. Manufacturers that have certified engine families to FELs above the applicable emission standards and do not have sufficient emission credits to offset the difference between the emission standard and the FEL for such engine families will be in violation of the conditions of the certificate of conformity for such engine families. The certificates of conformity may be voided <E T="03">ab initio</E> for those engine families.</P>

              <P>(j) In the event of a negative credit balance resulting from a credit trade, both the buyer(s) and the seller(s) are liable, except in cases involving fraud. Certificates of all engine families participating in a negative trade may be voided <E T="03">ab initio.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Where a buyer of credits is not responsible for causing the negative credit balance, the buyer is only liable to supply additional credits equivalent to any amount of invalid credits that the buyer used for its engine family(ies).</P>
              <P>(2) Credit holders responsible for the credit shortfall may be subject to the requirements of § 94.309(g)(3).</P>
              <P>(k) The following provisions limit credit exchanges between different types of engines:</P>
              <P>(1) Credits generated by Category 1 engine families may be used for compliance by Category 1 or Category 2 engine families. Credits generated from Category 1 engine families for use by Category 2 engine families must be discounted by 25 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) Credits generated by Category 2 engine families may be used for compliance only by Category 2 engine families.</P>
              <P>(3) Credits may not be exchanged between recreational and commercial engines.</P>
              <P>(l) Credit life shall be unlimited.<PRTPAGE P="660"/>

              <P>(a) For each participating engine family, calculate THC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM emission credits (positive or negative) according to the equation in paragraph (b) of this section and round emissions to the nearest one-hundredth of a megagram (Mg). Use consistent units throughout the calculation.</P>

              <P>(a) In the application for certification a manufacturer must:</P>

              <P>(1) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the averaging, banking, and/or trading programs. Separate declarations are required for each pollutant (THC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and PM).</P>
              <P>(2) Declare FELs for each engine family participating in certification averaging, banking, and/or trading.</P>
              <P>(i) The FELs must be to the same number of significant digits as the emission standard.</P>
              <P>(ii) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in § 94.304(m).</P>

              <P>(3) Conduct and submit detailed calculations of projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on quarterly production projections for each participating family and for each pollutant, using the applicable equation in § 94.305 and the applicable values of the terms in the equation for the specific family.<PRTPAGE P="661"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) If the engine family is projected to have negative emission credits, state specifically the source (manufacturer/engine family) of the credits necessary to offset the credit deficit according to quarterly projected production.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the engine family is projected to generate credits, state specifically where the quarterly projected credits will be applied (manufacturer/engine family or reserved).</P>
              <P>(4) Submit a statement that the engines for which certification is requested will not, to the best of the manufacturer's belief, cause the manufacturer to have a negative credit balance when all credits are calculated for all the manufacturer's engine families participating in the averaging, banking, and trading program.</P>
              <P>(b) Based on this information, each manufacturer's certification application must demonstrate:</P>
              <P>(1) That at the end of model year production, each engine family has a net emissions credit balance equal to or greater than zero for any pollutant and program for which participation in certification under averaging, banking, and/or trading is being sought. The equation in section § 94.305 shall be used in this calculation for each engine family.</P>
              <P>(2) That the manufacturer will obtain sufficient credits to be used to comply with the emission standard for any engine family with an FEL that exceeds the applicable emission standard, or where credits will be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where credits are being obtained, for each engine family involved the manufacturer must identify specifically the source of the credits being used (manufacturer/engine family). All such reports shall include all credits involved in certification averaging, banking, or trading.</P>
              <P>(3) That in cases where credits are being generated/supplied, the use of such credits is specifically designated (manufacturer/engine family or reserved). All such reports shall include all credits involved in certification averaging, banking, or trading.</P>
              <P>(c) Manufacturers must monitor projected versus actual production throughout the model year to ensure that compliance with emission standards is achieved at the end of the model year.</P>
              <P>(d) At the end of the model year, the manufacturer must provide the end-of-year reports required under § 94.309.</P>
              <P>(1) Projected credits based on the information supplied in the certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of conformity. However, any such projected credits must be validated based on review of the end of model year reports and may be revoked at a later time based on follow-up audits or any other verification measure deemed appropriate by the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(2) Compliance for engine families using averaging, banking, or trading will be determined at the end of the model year. Manufacturers that have certified engine families with credit balances for THC + NO<E T="52">X</E> and/or PM that do not equal or exceed zero shall be in violation of the conditions of the certificate of conformity for such engine families. The certificate of conformity may be voided <E T="03">ab initio</E> for those engine families.</P>
              <P>(e) Other conditions of certification.</P>
              <P>(1) All certificates issued are conditional upon compliance by the manufacturer with the provisions of this subpart both during and after the calendar year of production.</P>

              <P>(2) Failure to comply with all provisions of this subpart will be considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the certificate was issued, and the certificate may be deemed void <E T="03">ab initio.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer bears the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the certificate was issued were satisfied or waived.</P>

              <P>(a) Manufacturers must submit the certification information as required under § 94.306, and end-of-year reports each year as part of their participation in certification averaging, banking, and trading programs.</P>
              <P>(b) Quarterly reports. All entities involved in credit trades must submit quarterly reports. The reports shall include the source or recipient of the credits, the amount of credits involved plus remaining balances, details regarding the pollutant, and model year as well as the information prescribed in § 94.308(c). Copies of contracts related to credit trading must be included or supplied by the buyer, seller, and broker, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) End-of-year reports must include the information prescribed in § 94.308(b). The report shall include a calculation of credit balances for each family to show that the summation of the manufacturer's use of credits results in a credit balance equal to or greater than zero. The report shall be consistent in detail with the information submitted under § 94.306 and show how credit surpluses were dispersed and how credit shortfalls were met on a family specific basis. The end-of-year report shall incorporate any information reflected in previous quarterly reports.</P>

              <P>(d) The applicable production/sales volume for quarterly and end-of-year reports must be based on the location of either the point of first retail sale by the manufacturer or the point at which the engine is placed into service, whichever occurs first. This is called the final product purchase location.<PRTPAGE P="663"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) Each quarterly and end-of-year report submitted shall include a statement certifying to the accuracy and authenticity of the material reported therein.</P>
              <P>(f) Requirements for submission. (1) Quarterly reports must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the calendar quarter to the Designated Officer.</P>
              <P>(2) End-of-year reports must be submitted within 120 days of the end of the calendar year to the Designated Officer.</P>
              <P>(3) Failure by a manufacturer participating in the averaging, banking, or trading program to submit any quarterly or end-of-year reports in the specified time for all engines is a violation of sections 203(a)(1) and 213 of the Clean Air Act for each engine.</P>
              <P>(4) A manufacturer generating credits for banking only who fails to submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (120 days after the end of the calendar year) may not use or trade the credits until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits pending EPA review is not permitted in these circumstances.</P>
              <P>(g) Reporting errors. (1) Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in the end-of-year report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected 180-days subsequent to submission of the end-of-year report. Errors discovered by EPA after 180-days shall be correctable if, as a result of the correction, the manufacturer's credits are reduced. Errors in the manufacturer's favor are not corrected if discovered after the 180-day correction period allowed.</P>
              <P>(2) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous negative credit balances may be corrected by EPA.</P>

              <P>(3) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates a credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to purchase the necessary credits to bring the credit balance to zero. These credits must be supplied at the ratio of 1.1 credits for each 1.0 credit needed. If sufficient credits are not available to bring the credit balance to zero for the family(ies) involved, EPA may void the certificate(s) for that family(ies) <E T="03">ab initio.</E> In addition, all engines within an engine family for which there are insufficient credits will be considered to have violated the conditions of the certificate of conformity and therefore are not covered by that certificate.</P>
              <P>(4) If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's favor (that is, resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the manufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of the end-of-year report, the credits are restored for use by the manufacturer.</P>

              <P>(a) For Tier 2 and later Category 1 and Category 2 engines, manufacturers shall test production line engines in accordance with sampling procedures specified in § 94.505 and the test procedures specified in § 94.506. The production-line testing requirements of this part do not apply for other engines.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon request, the Administrator may also allow manufacturers to conduct alternate production line testing programs for Category 1 and Category 2 engines, provided the Administrator determines that the alternate production line testing program provides equivalent assurance that the engines that are being produced conform to the provisions of this part. As part of this allowance or for other reasons, the Administrator may waive some or all of the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) The requirements of this subpart apply with respect to all applicable standards and FELs of subpart A of this part, including the supplemental standards of § 94.8(e).</P>

              <P>(d) If you certify an engine family with carryover emission data, as described in § 94.206(c), and these equivalent engine families consistently pass the production-line testing requirements over the preceding two-year period, you may ask for a reduced testing rate for further production-line testing for that family. The minimum testing rate is one engine per engine family. If we reduce your testing rate, we may limit our approval to any number of model years. In determining whether <PRTPAGE P="667"/>to approve your request, we may consider the number of engines that have failed the emission tests.</P>

              <P>(a) At the start of each model year, the manufacturer will begin to select engines from each Category 1 and Category 2 engine family for production line testing. Each engine will be selected from the end of the production line. Testing shall be performed throughout the entire model year to the extent possible. Engines selected shall cover the broadest range of production possible.</P>
              <P>(1)(i) The required sample size for Category 1 engine manufacturers is one percent of projected annual U.S.-directed production for all Category 1 engine families, provided that no engine tested fails to meet applicable emission standards. Test engines shall include a proportional sample from each engine family. The required sample size is zero if a manufacturer's projected annual production for all Category 1 engine families is less than 100.</P>
              <P>(ii) The required sample size for a Category 2 engine family is one percent of projected annual U.S.-directed production for that engine family, with a minimum sample size of one test per model year provided that no engine tested fails to meet applicable emission standards.</P>
              <P>(2) Manufacturers may elect to test additional engines. All additional engines must be tested in accordance with the applicable test procedures of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator may reject any engines selected by the manufacturer if he/she determines that such engines are not representative of actual production.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer must assemble the test engines using the same mass production process that will be used for engines to be introduced into commerce.</P>
              <P>(c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used on any test engine or any portion thereof, including parts and subassemblies, that have not been or will not be used during the production and assembly of all other engines of that family, except with the approval of the Administrator.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) For engines subject to the provisions of this subpart, the prescribed test procedures are those procedures described in Subpart B of this part, except as provided in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, prescribe test procedures other than those specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any engine he/she determines is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If test procedures other than those in Subpart B of this part were used in certification of the engine family being tested under this subpart (other than alternate test procedures necessary for testing of a development engine instead of a low hour engine under § 94.9), the manufacturer shall use the test procedures used in certification for production line testing.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The manufacturer may not adjust, repair, prepare, modify, or perform any emission test on any test engine unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification and/or test is documented in the manufacturer's engine assembly and inspection procedures and is actually performed by the manufacturer or unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification and/or test is required or permitted under this subpart or is approved in advance by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(2) Any adjustable engine parameter must be set to values or positions that are within the range specified in the approved application for certification.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator may adjust or require to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification and production line testing, to any setting within the specified adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator, prior to the performance of any test.</P>

              <P>(c) Service Accumulation/Green Engine Factor. The manufacturer shall accumulate up to 300 hours of service on the engines to be tested. In lieu of conducting such service accumulation, the manufacturer may establish a Green Engine Factor for each regulated <PRTPAGE P="669"/>pollutant for each engine family to be used in calculating emissions test results. The manufacturer shall obtain the approval of the Administrator prior to using a Green Engine Factor.</P>
              <P>(d) The manufacturer may not perform any maintenance on test engines after selection for testing.</P>
              <P>(e) If an engine is shipped to a facility other than the production facility for production line testing, and an adjustment or repair is necessary because of such shipment, the engine manufacturer must perform the necessary adjustment or repair only after the initial test of the engine, except where the Administrator has determined that the test would be impossible to perform or would permanently damage the engine.</P>
              <P>(f) If an engine cannot complete the service accumulation or an emission test, because of a malfunction, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator authorize either the repair of that engine or its deletion from the test sequence.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Retesting.</E> If an engine manufacturer determines that any production line emission test of an engine is invalid, the engine must be retested in accordance with the requirements of this subpart. Emission results from all tests must be reported to EPA, including test results the manufacturer determines are invalid. The engine manufacturer must also include a detailed explanation of the reasons for invalidating any test in the quarterly report required in § 94.508(e). In the event a retest is performed, a request may be made to the Administrator, within ten days of the end of the production quarter, for permission to substitute the after-repair test results for the original test results. The Administrator will either affirm or deny the request by the engine manufacturer within ten working days from receipt of the request.</P>

              <P>(b) To calculate test results, sum the initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section for each test engine, divide by the number of tests conducted on the engine, and round to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional decimal place. (For example, if the applicable standard is 7.8, then round the test results to two places to the right of the decimal.)</P>
              <P>(c) To calculate the final test results for each test engine, apply the appropriate deterioration factors, derived in the certification process for the engine family, to the test results described in paragraph (b) of this section; round to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional decimal place. (For example, if the applicable standard is 7.8, then round the test results to two places to the right of the decimal.)</P>
              <P>(d)(1) If, subsequent to an initial failure of a Category 1 or Category 2 production line test, the average of the test results for the failed engine and the two additional engines tested, is greater than any applicable emission standard or FEL, the engine family is deemed to be in non-compliance with applicable emission standards, and the manufacturer must notify the Administrator within 2 working days of such noncompliance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any engine that fails a production line test pursuant to § 94.510(a), effective from the time the testing of that engine is completed.</P>
              <P>(b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for an engine family which is in noncompliance pursuant to § 94.510(b), thirty days after the engine family is deemed to be in noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(c) If the results of testing pursuant to this subpart indicate that engines of a particular family produced at one plant of a manufacturer do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity with respect to that family for engines manufactured by the manufacturer at all other plants.</P>
              <P>(d) The Administrator may suspend a certificate of conformity for any engine family in whole or in part if:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer fails to comply with any of the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(2) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information in any report or information provided to the Administrator under this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="672"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data submitted under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) An EPA enforcement officer is denied the opportunity to conduct activities authorized in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) An EPA enforcement officer is unable to conduct activities authorized in § 94.504 for any reason.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing of any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in part; a suspension or revocation is effective upon receipt of such notification or thirty days from the time an engine family is deemed to be in noncompliance under §§ 94.508(d), 94.510(a), or 94.510(b), whichever is earlier, except that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect to any failed engines as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for an engine family when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the remedy is one requiring a design change or changes to the engine and/or emission control system as described in the application for certification of the affected engine family.</P>
              <P>(g) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine:</P>
              <P>(1) Remedy the nonconformity;</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine conforms to applicable standards or family emission limits by retesting if applicable, the engine in accordance with this part; and</P>
              <P>(3) Submit a written report to the Administrator, after successful completion of testing on the failed engine, which contains a description of the remedy and test results for each engine in addition to other information that may be required by this part.</P>
              <P>(h) Once a certificate for a failed engine family has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider reinstating the certificate:</P>
              <P>(1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the engines, describes the remedy, including a description of any quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent future occurrences of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies will be implemented.</P>
              <P>(2) Demonstrate that the engine family for which the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with the regulations of this part by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family. Such testing must comply with the provisions of this subpart. If the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual engines after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for any engine actually determined to be in conformance with the applicable standards or family emission limits through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Once the certificate has been revoked for an engine family, if the manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a modified version of that family, the following actions must be taken before the Administrator may issue a certificate for that modified family:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that the change(s) in engine design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer, within five working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to evaluate the change or changes or whether additional testing will be required; and</P>

              <P>(2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the nonconformity, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the modified engine family does in fact conform with the regulations of this part by testing engines selected from normal production runs of that engine family. When both <PRTPAGE P="673"/>of these requirements are met, the Administrator shall reissue the certificate or issue a new certificate, as the case may be, to include that family. If this subsequent testing reveals failing data the revocation remains in effect.</P>
              <P>(j) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate of conformity for a test engine pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than 30 days (or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator) after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (f) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.</P>
              <P>(k) Any suspension of a certificate of conformity under paragraphs (a),(b),(c) and (d) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Shall be made only after the manufacturer concerned has been offered an opportunity for a hearing conducted in accordance with §§ 94.513, 94.514, and 94.515; and</P>
              <P>(2) Need not apply to engines no longer in the possession of the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(l) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of conformity pursuant to this section or voids a certificate of conformity under paragraph § 94.215, and prior to the commencement of a hearing under § 94.513, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke, or void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.</P>
              <P>(m) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines while conducting subsequent testing of the noncomplying family, a manufacturer may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that family. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject to the following condition: the manufacturer must commit to recall all engines of that family produced from the time the certificate is conditionally reinstated if the family fails subsequent testing and must commit to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the owner.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request for public hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the manufacturer disagrees with the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant to § 94.512(a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer's request shall be filed with the Administrator not later than 30 days after the Administrator's notification of his or her decision to suspend or revoke, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The manufacturer shall simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon the Designated Officer and file two copies with the Hearing Clerk of the Agency. Failure of the manufacturer to request a hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his or her discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the suspension or revocation.</P>
              <P>(c) A manufacturer shall include in the request for a public hearing:</P>

              <P>(2) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the manufacturer at the hearing, except that in the case of the hearing requested under § 94.512(j), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether tests have been properly conducted (specifically, whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning);</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines produced at plants other than the one from which engines were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's decision under § 94.512(c));</P>

              <P>(3) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and<PRTPAGE P="674"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's position on each of the issues raised.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General provisions.</E> (1) Unless otherwise specified, any person may apply for the exemptions allowed by this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraph (b) of this section describes the provisions that apply to temporary exemptions. Paragraph (c) of this section describes provisions that apply to permanent exemptions.</P>
              <P>(3) Applications for exemption under this section shall be mailed to the Designated Officer.</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding other requirements of this subpart, a nonconforming engine that qualifies for a temporary exemption under this paragraph (b) may be conditionally admitted into the United States if prior written approval for the conditional admission is obtained from the Administrator. Conditional admission is to be under bond. The Administrator may request that the U.S. Customs Service require a specific bond amount to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and this subpart. A written request for a temporary exemption from the Administrator shall contain the information required in § 94.803. Noncompliance with the provisions of this paragraph (b) will be considered unlawful importation and may result in the forfeiture of the total amount of the bond, exportation of the engine, and/or imposition of civil penalties.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exemption for repairs or alterations.</E> A person may conditionally import <PRTPAGE P="677"/>under bond a nonconforming engine solely for purpose of repair(s) or alteration(s). The engine may not be operated in the United States other than for the sole purpose of repair or alteration or shipment to the point of repair or alteration and to the port of export. It may not be sold or leased in the United States and is to be exported upon completion of the repair(s) or alteration(s).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Testing exemption.</E> A person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming engine for testing, subject to the requirements of § 94.905. A test engine may be operated in the United States provided that the operation is an integral part of the test. This exemption is limited to a period not exceeding one year from the date of importation unless a request is made by the appropriate importer, and subsequently granted by EPA, concerning the engine in accordance with § 94.905 for a subsequent one-year period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Display exemptions.</E> A person may conditionally import under bond a nonconforming engine solely for display purposes, subject to both of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) A display engine may be imported by any person for purposes related to a business or the public interest. Such purposes do not include collections normally inaccessible or unavailable to the public on a daily basis, display of an engine at a dealership, private use, or other purpose that the Administrator determines is not appropriate for display exemptions. A display engine may not be sold or leased in the United States and may not be operated in the United States except for the operation incident and necessary to the display purpose.</P>
              <P>(ii) A display exemption is granted for 12 months or for the duration of the display purpose, whichever is shorter. Extensions of up to 12 months each are available upon approval by the Administrator. In no circumstances, however, may the total period of exemption exceed 36 months.</P>
              <P>(c) A nonconforming engine that qualifies for a permanent exemption under this paragraph (c) may be admitted into the United States if prior written approval is obtained from the Administrator. A written request for a permanent exemption from the Administrator shall contain the information required in § 94.803. Noncompliance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) will be considered unlawful importation and may result in the exportation of the engine and/or imposition of civil penalties.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">National security exemption.</E> Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, an engine may be permanently imported into the United States under the national security exemption found in § 94.908.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Competition exemption.</E> Notwithstanding any other requirement of this subpart, an engine may be permanently imported into the United States under the competition exemption found in § 94.906(c).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Incomplete marine engine exemption.</E> An engine that is intended to be modified prior to being placed into service as a marine engine may be imported in a nonconforming configuration, subject to the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(i) The modified engine must be covered by a valid marine engine certificate issued under this part prior to importation and held by a post-manufacture marinizer. (Note: Prior to certification, manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers may import uncertified engines for testing, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(ii) The engine may not be placed into non-marine service prior to being installed in a vessel.</P>
              <P>(iii) The importer must obtain written approval from the Administrator prior to admission.</P>
              <P>(iv) The engine and engine container must be labeled as specified by the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(v) A manufacturer importing an engine under this exemption must modify the engine to comply with the requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) The importation of an engine (including an engine incorporated in an imported marine vessel) which is not covered by a certificate of conformity other than in accordance with this subpart and the entry regulations of the U.S. Customs Service is prohibited. Failure to comply with this section is <PRTPAGE P="678"/>a violation of section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise permitted by this subpart, during a period of conditional admission, the importer of an engine may not:</P>
              <P>(1) Operate the engine in the United States; or</P>
              <P>(2) Sell or lease or offer the engine for sale or lease.</P>
              <P>(c) An engine conditionally admitted pursuant to § 94.804 and not otherwise permanently exempted or excluded by the end of the period of conditional admission, or within such additional time as the Administrator and the U.S. Customs Service may allow, is deemed to be unlawfully imported into the United States in violation of section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act, unless the engine has been delivered to the U.S. Customs Service for export or other disposition under applicable Customs laws and regulations by the end of the period of conditional admission. An engine not so delivered is subject to seizure by the U.S. Customs Service.</P>
              <P>(d) An importer who violates section 213(d) and section 203 of the Act is subject to a civil penalty under section 205 of the Act and § 94.1106. In addition to the penalty provided in the Act and § 94.1106, where applicable, a person or entity who imports an engine under the exemption provisions of § 94.804 and, who fails to deliver the engine to the U.S. Customs Service by the end of the period of conditional admission is liable for liquidated damages in the amount of the bond required by applicable Customs laws and regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Testing exemption.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The Administrator may exempt from the standards and/or other requirements and prohibitions of this part new engines that are being used solely for the purpose of conducting a test program. Any person requesting an exemption for the purpose of conducting a test program must demonstrate the following:</P>
              <P>(i) That the proposed test program has a purpose which constitutes an appropriate basis for an exemption in accordance this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) That the proposed test program necessitates the granting of an exemption;</P>
              <P>(iii) That the proposed test program exhibits reasonableness in scope; and</P>
              <P>(iv) That the proposed test program exhibits a degree of oversight and control consonant with the purpose of the test program and EPA's monitoring requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section describe what constitutes a sufficient demonstration for each of the four elements identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) With respect to the purpose of the proposed test program, an appropriate purpose would be research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, technology development, or training, but not national security. A concise statement of purpose is a required item of information.</P>
              <P>(c) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, necessity arises from an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited acts under § 94.1103. In appropriate circumstances, time constraints may be a sufficient basis for necessity, but the cost of certification alone, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, is not a basis for necessity.</P>
              <P>(d) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length and affect a reasonable number of engines. In this regard, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) An estimate of the program's duration; and</P>
              <P>(2) The maximum number of engines involved.</P>
              <P>(e) With respect to control, the test program must incorporate procedures consistent with the purpose of the test and be capable of affording EPA monitoring capability. As a minimum, required items of information include:</P>
              <P>(1) The technical nature of the testing;</P>
              <P>(2) The location(s) of the testing;</P>
              <P>(3) The time or work duration of the testing;</P>
              <P>(4) The ownership arrangement with regard to the engines involved in the testing;</P>
              <P>(5) The intended final disposition of the engines;</P>
              <P>(6) The manner in which the engine identification numbers will be identified, recorded, and made available; and</P>
              <P>(7) The means or procedure whereby test results will be recorded.</P>

              <P>(f) A manufacturer of new engines may request a testing exemption to cover engines intended for use in test programs planned or anticipated over the course of a subsequent two-year period. Unless otherwise required by the <PRTPAGE P="680"/>Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division, a manufacturer requesting such an exemption need only furnish the information required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(2) of this section along with a description of the recordkeeping and control procedures that will be employed to assure that the engines are used for purposes consistent with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) For engines being used for the purpose of developing a fundamentally new emission control technology related either to an alternative fuel or an aftertreatment device, the Administrator may exempt the engine from some or all of the applicable standards of this part for the full useful life of the engine, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) The manufacturer must establish, maintain, and retain the following adequately organized and indexed information on each exempted engine:</P>
              <P>(i) engine identification number;</P>
              <P>(ii) Use of the engine on exempt status; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Final disposition of any engine removed from exempt status.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer must provide right of entry and access to these records to EPA Enforcement Officers as outlined in § 94.208.</P>
              <P>(3) The manufacturer must permanently affix a label to each engine on exempt status, unless the requirement is waived or an alternate procedure is approved by the Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division. This label should:</P>
              <P>(i) Be affixed in a readily visible portion of the engine;</P>
              <P>(ii) Be attached in such a manner that cannot be removed without destruction or defacement;</P>
              <P>(iii) State in the English language and in block letters and numerals of a color that contrasts with the background of the label, the following information:</P>
              <P>(A) The label heading “Emission Control Information”;</P>
              <P>(B) Full corporate name and trademark of manufacturer;</P>
              <P>(C) Engine displacement, engine family identification, and model year of engine; or person of office to be contacted for further information about the engine;</P>
              <P>(D) The statement “This engine is exempt from the prohibitions of 40 CFR 94.1103.”</P>
              <P>(4) No provision of paragraph (a)(3) of this section prevents a manufacturer from including any other information it desires on the label.</P>
              <P>(5) The engine is not used in revenue-generating service, or sold.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Display exemption.</E> An uncertified engine that is to be used solely for display purposes, and that will only be operated incident and necessary to the display purpose, and will not be sold unless an applicable certificate of conformity has been obtained for the engine, is exempt without request from the standards of this part. This does not apply to imported engines (see § 94.804).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Competition exemption.</E> The Administrator may exempt, upon request, engines that are intended by the manufacturer to be used solely for competition. Engines that are modified after they have been placed into service and are used solely for competition are exempt without request.</P>

Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or 40 CFR part 89, 92, or 1039. This paragraph (c) applies to engine manufacturers, boat builders who use such an engine, and all other persons as if the engine were used in its originally intended application. The prohibited acts of § 94.1103(a)(1) apply to these new engines and vessels; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86, 89, 92, or 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 94 for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines do not conform to the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under this part 94 or under 40 CFR part 85, 89, 92, or 1039.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Specific requirements.</E> If you are an engine manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements regarding your new marine engine, the engine is eligible for an exemption under this section:</P>
              <P>(1) You must produce it by marinizing an engine covered by a valid certificate of conformity from one of the following programs:</P>
              <P>(i) Heavy-duty highway engines (40 CFR part 86).</P>
              <P>(ii) Land-based nonroad diesel engines (40 CFR part 89 or 1039).</P>
              <P>(iii) Locomotive engines (40 CFR part 92).</P>
              <P>(2) The engine must have the label required under 40 CFR part 86, 89, 92, or 1039.</P>
              <P>(3) You must not make any changes to the certified engine that could reasonably be expected to increase its emissions. For example, if you make any of the following changes to one of these engines, you do not qualify for the engine dressing exemption:</P>
              <P>(i) Change any fuel system parameters from the certified configuration, or change, remove, or fail to properly install any other component, element of design, or calibration specified in the engine manufacturer's application for certification. This includes aftertreatment devices and all related components.</P>
              <P>(ii) Replacing an original turbocharger, except that small-volume manufacturers of recreational engines may replace an original turbocharger with one that matches the performance of the original turbocharger.</P>
              <P>(iii) Modify or design the marine engine cooling or aftercooling system so that temperatures or heat rejection rates are outside the original engine manufacturer's specified ranges.</P>
              <P>(4) You must show that fewer than 50 percent of the engine family's total sales in the United States are used in marine applications. This includes engines used in any application, without regard to which company manufactures the vessel or equipment. Show this as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If you are the original manufacturer of the engine, base this showing on your sales information.</P>
              <P>(ii) In all other cases, you must get the original manufacturer of the engine to confirm this based on its sales information.</P>
              <P>(e) If you are an engine manufacturer or boat builder using this exemption, you must do all of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Make sure the original engine label will remain clearly visible after installation in the vessel.</P>

              <P>(2) Add a permanent supplemental label to the engine in a position where it will remain clearly visible after installation in the vessel. In your engine label, do the following:<PRTPAGE P="682"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Include the heading: “Marine Engine Emission Control Information”.</P>
              <P>(ii) Include your full corporate name and trademark.</P>
              <P>(iii) State: “This engine was marinized without affecting its emission controls.”</P>
              <P>(iv) State the date you finished marinizing the engine (month and year).</P>
              <P>(3) Send a signed letter to the Designated Officer by the end of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you) with all the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone number.</P>
              <P>(ii) List the engine models for which you expect to use this exemption in the coming year and describe your basis for meeting the sales restrictions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) State: “We prepare each listed engine model for marine application without making any changes that could increase its certified emission levels, as described in 40 CFR 94.907.”</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Engine inventories.</E> In general you may use up your inventory of engines that are not certified to new marine emission standards if they were originally manufactured before the date of the new standards. However, stockpiling these engines is a violation of § 94.1103(a)(1)(i)(A).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to comply.</E> If your engines do not meet the criteria listed in paragraph (d) of this section, they will be subject to the standards, requirements, and prohibitions of this part 94 and the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86, 89, 92, or 1039 will not be deemed to also be a certificate issued under this part 94. Introducing these engines into commerce without a valid exemption or certificate of conformity under this part violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 94.1103(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Data submission.</E> (1) If you are the original manufacturer and marinizer of an exempted engine, you must send us emission test data on the appropriate marine duty cycles. You can include the data in your application for certification or in the letter described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If you are the original manufacturer of an exempted engine that is marinized by a post-manufacture marinizer, you may be required to send us emission test data on the appropriate marine duty cycles. If such data are requested you will be allowed a reasonable amount of time to collect the data.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Participation in averaging, banking and trading.</E> Engines adapted for marine use under this section may not generate or use emission credits under this part 94. These engines may generate credits under the ABT provisions in 40 CFR part 86, 89, 92, or 1039, as applicable. These engines must use emission credits under 40 CFR part 86, 89, 92, or 1039 as applicable if they are certified to an FEL that exceeds an applicable standard.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Operator requirements.</E> The requirements for vessel manufacturers, owners, and operators in subpart K of this part apply to these engines whether they are certified under this part 94 or another part as allowed by this section.</P>

              <P>(a) A new engine intended solely for export, and so labeled or tagged on the outside of any container and on the engine, is subject to the provisions of § 94.1103, unless the importing country has new marine engine emission standards which differ from EPA standards.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section, a country having no standards whatsoever is deemed to be a country having emission standards which differ from EPA standards.</P>
              <P>(c) It is a condition of any exemption for the purpose of export under paragraph (a) of this section, that such exemption is void ab initio with respect to a new engine intended solely for export, where such engine is sold, or offered for sale, to an ultimate purchaser or otherwise distributed or introduced into commerce in the United States for purposes other than export.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Granting of exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If upon completion of the review of an exemption request made pursuant to § 94.905 or § 94.908, EPA determines it is appropriate to grant such an exemption, a memorandum of exemption is to be prepared and submitted to the person requesting the exemption. The memorandum is to set forth the basis for the exemption, its scope, and such terms and conditions as are deemed necessary. Such terms and conditions generally include, but are not limited to, agreements by the applicant to conduct the exempt activity in the manner described to EPA, create and maintain adequate records accessible to EPA at reasonable times, employ labels for the exempt engines setting forth the nature of the exemption, take appropriate measures to assure that the terms of the exemption are met, and advise EPA of the termination of the activity and the ultimate disposition of the engines.</P>
              <P>(b) Any exemption granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is deemed to cover any subject engine only to the extent that the specified terms and conditions are complied with. A breach of any term or condition causes the exemption to be void ab initio with respect to any engine. Consequently, the causing or the performing of an act prohibited under § 94.1103(a)(1) or (a)(3), other than in strict conformity with all terms and conditions of this exemption, renders the person to whom the exemption is granted, and any other person to whom the provisions of § 94.1103(a) are applicable, liable to suit under sections 204 and 205 of the Act.</P>

If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 or 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 94 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 94.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Boat builder provisions.</E> If you are not an engine manufacturer, you may install an engine certified for land-based applications in a marine vessel as long as you meet all the qualifying criteria and requirements specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. If you modify the non-marine engine, we will consider you a manufacturer of a new marine engine. Such engine modifications prevent you from using the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Liability.</E> Engines for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR part 89 or 1039. This paragraph (c) applies to engine manufacturers, boat builders who use such an engine, and all other persons as if the engine were used in its originally intended application.

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualifying criteria.</E> If you are an engine manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements regarding your new marine engine, the engine is eligible for an exemption under this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The marine engine must be identical in all material respects to a land-based engine covered by a valid certificate of conformity for the appropriate model year showing that it meets emission standards for engines of that power rating under 40 CFR part 89 or 1039.</P>
              <P>(2) The engines may not be used as propulsion marine engines.</P>
              <P>(3) You must show that the number of auxiliary marine engines from the engine family must be smaller than the number of land-based engines from the engine family sold in the United States, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If you are the original manufacturer of the engine, base this showing on your sales information.</P>
              <P>(ii) In all other cases, you must get the original manufacturer of the engine to confirm this based on its sales information.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Specific requirements.</E> If you are an engine manufacturer or boat builder using this exemption, you must do all of the following:</P>

              <P>(1) The engine must be intended for installation in a lifeboat or a rescue boat as specified in 40 CFR 1042.625(a)(1)(i) or (ii).</P>
              <P>(2) This exemption is available from the initial effective date for the Tier 2 standards until the engine model (or an engine of comparable size, weight, and performance) has been certified as complying with the Tier 2 standards and Coast Guard requirements. For example, this exemption would apply for new engine models that have not yet been certified to the Tier 2 standards.</P>
              <P>(3) The engine must meet the Tier 1 emission standards specified in § 94.8.</P>

              <P>(b) If you introduce an engine into U.S. commerce under this section, you must meet the labeling requirements in § 94.212, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 94.212(b)(6):

              <P>(e) For each marine vessel containing a Category 3 engine, the owner shall annually review the vessel's records and submit to EPA a signed statement certifying compliance during the preceding year with the requirements of this part that are applicable to owners and operators of such vessels. Alternately, if review of the vessel's records indicates that there has been one or more violations of the requirements of <PRTPAGE P="687"/>this part, the owner shall submit to EPA a signed statement specifying the noncompliance, including the nature of the noncompliance, the time of the noncompliance, and any efforts made to remedy the noncompliance. The statement of compliance (or noncompliance) required by this paragraph shall be signed by the executive with responsibility for marine activities of the owner. If the vessel is operated by a different business entity than the vessel owner, the reporting requirements of this paragraph (e) apply to both the owner and the operator. Compliance with these review and certification requirements by either the vessel owner or the vessel operator with respect to a compliance statement will be considered compliance with these requirements by both of these parties for that compliance statement. The executive(s) may authorize a captain or other primary operator to conduct this review and submit the certification, provided that the certification statement is accompanied by written authorization for that individual to submit such statements. The Administrator may waive the requirements of this paragraph when equivalent assurance of compliance is otherwise available.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prohibited acts.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The following acts and the causing thereof are prohibited:</P>
              <P>(1)(i)(A) In the case of a manufacturer of new engines, the sale, the offering for sale, the introduction into commerce, the delivery for introduction into commerce, or the distribution in commerce of any new engine that is subject to the standards of this part, unless such engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued (and in effect) under regulations found in this part.</P>
              <P>(B) The manufacture of an engine for the purpose of an act listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section unless such engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued (and in effect) under regulations found in this part prior to its introduction into commerce.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of any person, except as provided in Subpart I of this part, the importation into the United States of any engine manufactured on or after the implementation date of the applicable emission limits for the relevant engine, unless such engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued (and in effect) under regulations found in this part.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) For a person to fail or refuse to permit access to or copying of records or to fail to make reports or provide information required under this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) For a person to fail or refuse to permit entry, testing, or inspection authorized under this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) For a person to fail or refuse to perform tests, or to have tests performed as required by this part.</P>
              <P>(iv) For a person to fail to establish or maintain records as required under this part.</P>
              <P>(v) For an owner or operator of a vessel using a Category 3 engine to refuse to allow the in-use testing described in § 94.1003 to be performed.</P>
              <P>(vi) For a manufacturer, owner or operator of a Category 3 engine to fail to provide maintenance instructions as required by § 94.211.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) For a person to remove or render inoperative a device or element of design installed on or in an engine in compliance with regulations under this part, or to set any adjustable parameter to a setting outside of the range specified by the manufacturer, as approved in the application for certification by the Administrator (except as allowed by §§ 94.1003 and 94.1004).</P>

              <P>(ii) For a person to manufacture, sell or offer to sell, or install, a part or component intended for use with, or as <PRTPAGE P="688"/>part of, an engine, where a principal effect of the part or component is to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative a device or element of design installed on or in an engine in compliance with regulations issued under this part, and where the person knows or should know that the part or component is being offered for sale or installed for this use or put to such use.</P>
              <P>(iii) for a person to deviate from the provisions of § 94.11 when rebuilding an engine (or rebuilding a portion of an engine or engine system).</P>
              <P>(4) For a manufacturer of a new engine subject to standards prescribed under this part:</P>
              <P>(i) To sell, offer for sale, or introduce or deliver for introduction into commerce, a new engine unless the manufacturer has complied with the requirements of § 94.1107.</P>
              <P>(ii) To sell, offer for sale, or introduce or deliver for introduction into commerce, a new engine unless all required labels and tags are affixed to the engine in accordance with § 94.212.</P>

              <P>(iv) Except as provided in § 94.211, to provide directly or indirectly in any communication to the ultimate purchaser or a subsequent purchaser that the coverage of a warranty under the Act is conditioned upon use of a part, component, or system manufactured by the manufacturer or a person acting for the manufacturer or under its control, or conditioned upon service performed by such persons.</P>
              <P>(v) To fail or refuse to comply with the terms and conditions of the warranty under § 94.1107.</P>
              <P>(5) For a manufacturer of marine vessels to distribute in commerce, sell, offer for sale, or deliver for introduction into commerce a new vessel containing an engine not covered by a certificate of conformity applicable for an engine model year the same as or later than the calendar year in which the manufacture of the new vessel is initiated. This prohibition covers improper installation in a manner such that the installed engine would not be covered by the engine manufacturer's certificate. Improper installation would include, but is not limited to, failure to follow the engine manufacturer's instructions related to engine cooling, exhaust aftertreatment, emission sampling ports, or any other emission-related component, parameter, or setting. In general, you may use up your normal inventory of engines not certified to new emission standards if they were built before the date of the new standards. However, we consider stockpiling of these engines to be a violation of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. (Note: For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(5), the manufacture of a vessel is initiated when the keel is laid, or the vessel is at a similar stage of construction.)</P>
              <P>(6) For any person to install a recreational marine engine in a vessel that is manufactured on or after the implementation date of the applicable standards and that is not a recreational vessel.</P>
              <P>(7)(i) For an owner or operator of a vessel using a Category 3 engine to fail or refuse to ensure that an engine is properly adjusted as set forth in § 94.1004.</P>
              <P>(ii) For an owner or operator of a vessel using a Category 3 to fail to maintain or repair an engine as set forth in § 94.1004.</P>
              <P>(iii) For an owner or operator of a vessel using a Category 3 engine to operate an engine in violation of the requirements of § 94.1004(c).</P>
              <P>(iv) For an owner or operator of a vessel using a Category 3 engine to fail to comply with any applicable provision in this part for recordkeeping, reporting, or submission of information to EPA, including the annual certification requirements of § 94.1004.</P>
              <P>(8) For an owner or operator of a vessel installing a replacement engine under the provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section to make modifications to significantly increase the value of the vessel within six months after installing the replacement engine.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of enforcement of this part, the following apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Nothing in paragraph (a)(3) of this section is to be construed to require the use of any manufacturer's parts in maintaining or repairing an engine.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) Actions for the purpose of repair or replacement of a device or element of design or any other item are not considered prohibited acts under <PRTPAGE P="689"/>paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section if the action is a necessary and temporary procedure, the device or element is replaced upon completion of the procedure, and the action results in the proper functioning of the device or element of design.</P>
              <P>(ii) Actions for emergency purposes are not considered prohibited acts under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section if the action is a necessary and temporary procedure and the device or element is replaced such that the proper functioning of the device or element of design is restored as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(3) Where the Administrator determines that no engine that is certified to the requirements of this part is produced by any manufacturer with the appropriate physical or performance characteristics to repower a vessel, the Administrator may allow an engine manufacturer to introduce into commerce a replacement engine without complying with all of the otherwise applicable requirements of this part. Such engine shall not be subject to the prohibitions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, subject to all the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(i) The engine requiring replacement is not certified or is certified to emission standards that are less stringent than those in effect when the replacement engine is built.</P>
              <P>(ii) The engine manufacturer or its agent takes ownership and possession of the engine being replaced or confirms that the engine has been destroyed.</P>

              <P>(iii) If the engine being replaced was not certified to any emission standards under this part, the replacement engine must have a permanent label with your corporate name and trademark and the following language, or similar alternate language approved by the Administrator:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH U.S. EPA MARINE EMISSION REQUIREMENTS. SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO REPLACE A MARINE ENGINE BUILT BEFORE JANUARY 1, [Insert appropriate year reflecting when the earliest tier of standards began to apply to engines of that size and type] MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(iv) If the engine being replaced was certified to emission standards less stringent than those in effect when you produce the replacement engine, the replacement engine must have a permanent label with your corporate name and trademark and the following language, or similar alternate language approved by the Administrator:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA MARINE EMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR [Insert appropriate year reflecting when the Tier 1 or Tier 2 standards for the replaced engine began to apply] ENGINES UNDER 40 CFR 94.1103(b)(3). SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO REPLACE A MARINE ENGINE BUILT BEFORE JANUARY 1, [Insert appropriate year reflecting when the next tier of emission standards began to apply] MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(v) Where the replacement engine is intended to replace an engine that is certified to emission standards that are less stringent than those in effect when the replacement engine is built, the replacement engine shall be identical in all material respects to a certified configuration of the same or later model year as the engine being replaced.</P>
              <P>(vi) Engines sold pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph will neither generate nor use emission credits and will not be part of any accounting under the averaging, banking and trading program.</P>
              <P>(vii) In cases where an engine is to be imported for replacement purposes under the provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the term “engine manufacturer” shall not apply to an individual or other entity that does not possess a current Certificate of Conformity issued by EPA under this part; and</P>
              <P>(viii) The provisions of this section may not be used to circumvent emission standards that apply to new engines under this part.</P>

              <P>(4) An engine manufacturer may make the determination related to replacement engines described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section instead of the Administrator, if the new engine is needed to replace an engine that has experienced catastrophic failure. The engine manufacturer must consider whether certified engines are available from its own product lineup or that of <PRTPAGE P="690"/>the manufacturer of the engine being replaced (if different). The engine manufacturer must keep records explaining why a certified engine was not available and make these records available upon request.</P>

              <P>(i) To enter, at reasonable times, any establishment of the manufacturer, or of any person whom the manufacturer engaged to perform any activity required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for the purposes of inspecting or observing any activity conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) To inspect records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities used in performing an activity required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, by the manufacturer or by a person whom the manufacturer engaged to perform the activity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemption provision.</E> The Administrator may exempt a new engine from § 94.1103 upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator may find necessary for the purpose of export, research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, or training, or for reasons of national security, or for other purposes allowed by subpart J of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Importation provision.</E> (1) A new engine, offered for importation or imported by a person in violation of § 94.1103 is to be refused admission into the United States, but the Secretary of the Treasury and the Administrator may, by joint regulation, provide for deferring a final determination as to admission and authorizing the delivery of such an engine offered for import to the owner or consignee thereof upon such terms and conditions (including the furnishing of a bond) as may appear to them appropriate to insure that the engine will be brought into conformity with the standards, requirements, and limitations applicable to it under this part.</P>
              <P>(2) If an engine is finally refused admission under this paragraph (c), the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause disposition thereof in accordance with the customs laws unless it is exported, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of notice of the refusal or additional time as may be permitted pursuant to the Treasury regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) Disposition in accordance with the customs laws may not be made in such manner as may result, directly or indirectly, in the sale, to the ultimate consumer, of a new engine that fails to comply with applicable standards of the Administrator under this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Export provision.</E> A new engine intended solely for export, and so labeled or tagged on the outside of the container if used and on the engine, shall be subject to the provisions of § 94.1103, except that if the country that is to receive the engine has emission standards that differ from the standards prescribed under subpart A of this part, then the engine must comply with the standards of the country that is to receive the engine.<PRTPAGE P="691"/>

              <P>This section specifies actions that are prohibited and the maximum civil penalties that we can assess for each violation. The maximum penalty values listed in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section are shown for calendar year 2004. As described in paragraph (d) of this section, maximum penalty limits for later years are set forth in 40 CFR part 19.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Violations.</E> A violation of the requirements of this subpart is a violation of the applicable provisions of the Act, including sections 213(d) and 203, and is subject to the penalty provisions thereunder.</P>
              <P>(1) A person who violates § 94.1103(a)(1), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), or (a)(7)(iv) or a manufacturer or dealer who violates § 94.1103(a)(3)(i) or (iii) or § 94.1103(a)(7) is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $32,500 for each violation.</P>
              <P>(2) A person other than a manufacturer or dealer who violates § 94.1103(a)(3)(i) or (iii) or § 94.1103(a)(7)(i), (ii), or (iii) or any person who violates § 94.1103(a)(3)(ii) is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $2,750 for each violation.</P>
              <P>(3) A violation with respect to § 94.1103(a)(1), (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(iii), (a)(4), or (a)(5), (a)(7) constitutes a separate offense with respect to each engine.</P>
              <P>(4) A violation with respect to § 94.1103(a)(3)(ii) constitutes a separate offense with respect to each part or component. Each day of a violation with respect to § 94.1103(a)(5) or (a)(7)(iv) constitutes a separate offense.</P>
              <P>(5) Each two hour period of a violation with respect to § 94.1103(a)(7)(iii) constitutes a separate offense. A violation of § 94.1103(a)(7)(iii) lasting less than two hours constitutes a single offense.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Civil actions.</E> The Administrator may commence a civil action to assess and recover any civil penalty under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) An action under this paragraph (b) may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the defendant resides or has the Administrator's principal place of business, and the court has jurisdiction to assess a civil penalty.</P>
              <P>(2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty to be assessed under this paragraph (b), the court is to take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(3) In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who are required to attend a district court in any district may run into any other district.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative assessment of certain penalties.</E> (1) Administrative penalty authority. Subject to 42 U.S.C. 7524(c), in lieu of commencing a civil action under paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator may assess any civil penalty prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the maximum amount of penalty sought against each violator in a penalty assessment proceeding shall not exceed $270,000, unless the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the Administrator and the Attorney General is not subject to judicial review. Assessment of a civil penalty shall be by an order made on the record after opportunity for a hearing held in accordance with the procedures found at part 22 of this chapter. The Administrator may compromise, or remit, with or without conditions, any <PRTPAGE P="692"/>administrative penalty which may be imposed under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determining amount.</E> In determining the amount of any civil penalty assessed under this paragraph (c), the Administrator shall take into account the gravity of the violation, the economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, the size of the violator's business, the violator's history of compliance with Title II of the Act, action taken to remedy the violation, the effect of the penalty on the violator's ability to continue in business, and such other matters as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of administrator's action.</E> (i) Action by the Administrator under this paragraph (c) does not affect or limit the Administrator's authority to enforce any provisions of the Act; except that any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action under this paragraph (c), or for which the Administrator has issued a final order not subject to further judicial review and for which the violator has paid a penalty assessment under this paragraph shall not be the subject of a civil penalty action under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) No action by the Administrator under this paragraph (c) shall affect a person's obligation to comply with a section of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Finality of order.</E> An order issued under this paragraph (c) is to become final 30 days after its issuance unless a petition for judicial review is filed under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed in accordance with this paragraph (c) may seek review of the assessment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, in which such person resides, or where the person's principal place of business is located, within the 30-day period beginning on the date a civil penalty order is issued. The person shall simultaneously send a copy of the filing by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General. The Administrator shall file in the court within 30 days a certified copy, or certified index, as appropriate, of the record on which the order was issued. The court is not to set aside or remand any order issued in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (c) unless substantial evidence does not exist in the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion, and the court is not to impose additional civil penalties unless the Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. In any proceedings, the United States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed under this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Collection.</E> (i) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the Administrator as provided in this part after the order making the assessment has become final or after a court in an action brought under paragraph (c)(5) of this section has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Administrator shall request that the Attorney General bring a civil action in an appropriate district court to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)) from the date of the final order or the date of final judgment, as the case may be). In such an action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty is not subject to review.</P>
              <P>(ii) A person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty as described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section shall be required to pay, in addition to that amount and interest, the United States' enforcement expenses, including attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings, and a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The nonpayment penalty is an amount equal to ten percent of the aggregate amount of that person's penalties and nonpayment penalties which are unpaid as of the beginning of such quarter.</P>

              <P>(d) The maximum penalty values listed in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section are shown for calendar year 2004.

              <SUBJECT>Warranty provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The manufacturer of each engine must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser or owner that the engine is designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at the time of sale with applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and is free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period (as determined under § 94.10).</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of this section, the owner of any engine warranted under this part is responsible for the proper maintenance of the engine. Proper maintenance includes replacement and/or service, as needed, at the owner's expense at a service establishment or facility of the owner's choosing, of all parts, items, or devices which were in general use with engines prior to 1999. For diesel engines, this would generally include replacement or cleaning of the fuel delivery and injection system.</P>

              <SUBJECT>In-use compliance provisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Effective with respect to engines subject to the requirements of this part:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Administrator determines that a substantial number of any class or category of engines, although properly maintained and used, do not conform to the regulations prescribed under section 213 of the Act when in actual use throughout their useful life period (as defined under § 94.2), the Administrator shall immediately notify the manufacturer of such nonconformity and require the manufacturer to submit a plan for remedying the nonconformity of the engines with respect to which such notification is given.</P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer's plan shall provide that the nonconformity of any such engines which are properly used and maintained will be remedied at the expense of the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the manufacturer disagrees with such determination of nonconformity and so advises the Administrator, the Administrator shall afford the manufacturer and other interested persons an opportunity to present their views and evidence in support thereof at a public hearing. Unless, as a result of such hearing, the Administrator withdraws such determination of nonconformity, the Administrator shall, within 60 days after the completion of such hearing, order the manufacturer to provide prompt notification of such nonconformity in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Any notification required to be given by the manufacturer under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to any class or category of engines shall be given to ultimate purchasers, subsequent purchasers (if known), and dealers (as applicable) in such manner and containing such information as required in Subparts E and H of this part.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) The certifying manufacturer shall furnish with each new engine written instructions for the proper maintenance and use of the engine by the ultimate purchaser as required under § 94.211.</P>
              <P>(ii) The instruction under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section must not include any condition on the ultimate purchaser's using, in connection with such engine, any component or service (other than a component or service provided without charge under the terms of the purchase agreement) which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Such instructions also must not directly or indirectly distinguish between service performed by the franchised dealers of such manufacturer, or any other service establishments with which such manufacturer has a commercial relationship, and service performed by independent engine repair facilities with which such manufacturer has no commercial relationship.</P>
              <P>(iii) The prohibition of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may be waived by the Administrator if:</P>

              <P>(A) The manufacturer satisfies the Administrator that the engine will <PRTPAGE P="694"/>function properly only if the component or service so identified is used in connection with such engine; and</P>
              <P>(B) The Administrator finds that such a waiver is in the public interest.</P>
              <P>(iv) In addition, the manufacturer shall indicate by means of a label or tag permanently affixed to the engine that the engine is covered by a certificate of conformity issued for the purpose of assuring achievement of emission standards prescribed under section 213 of the Act. This label or tag shall also contain information relating to control of emissions as prescribed under § 94.212.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer bears all cost obligation any dealer incurs as a result of a requirement imposed by paragraph (a) of this section. The transfer of any such cost obligation from a manufacturer to a dealer through franchise or other agreement is prohibited.</P>
              <P>(c) If a manufacturer includes in an advertisement a statement respecting the cost or value of emission control devices or systems, the manufacturer shall set forth in the statement the cost or value attributed to these devices or systems by the Secretary of Labor (through the Bureau of Labor Statistics). The Secretary of Labor, and his or her representatives, has the same access for this purpose to the books, documents, papers, and records of a manufacturer as the Comptroller General has to those of a recipient of assistance for purposes of section 311 of the Act.</P>
