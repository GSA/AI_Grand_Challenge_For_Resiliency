      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              § 80.22
              Controls and prohibitions.
              (a) After December 31, 1995, no person shall sell, offer for sale, supply, offer for supply, dispense, transport, or introduce into commerce gasoline represented to be unleaded gasoline unless such gasoline meets the defined requirements for unleaded gasoline in § 80.2(g); nor shall he dispense, or cause or allow the gasoline other than unleaded gasoline to be dispensed into any motor vehicle which is equipped with a gasoline tank filler inlet which is designed for the introduction of unleaded gasoline.
              (b) After December 31, 1995, no person shall sell, offer for sale, supply, offer for supply, dispense, transport, or introduce into commerce for use as fuel in any motor vehicle (as defined in Section 216(2) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7550(2)), any gasoline which is produced with the use of lead additives or which contains more than 0.05 gram of lead per gallon.
              (c)-(e) [Reserved]
              (f) Every retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer shall equip all gasoline pumps from which gasoline is dispensed into motor vehicles with a nozzle spout that meets all the following specifications:
              (1) The outside diameter of the terminal end shall not be greater than 0.840 inches (2.134 centimeters).
              (2) The terminal end shall have a straight section of at least 2.5 inches (6.34 centimeters).

              (3) The retaining spring shall terminate at least 3.0 inches (7.6 centimeters) from the terminal end.
              
              (g) The specifications in this paragraph (g) apply for any new nozzle installations used primarily for dispensing gasoline into marine vessels beginning January 1, 2009. (Note that nozzles meeting the specifications of this paragraph (g) also meet the specifications of paragraph (f) of this section. Note also that the additional specifications in this paragraph (g) do not apply for nozzles used primarily for dispensing gasoline into motor vehicles rather than marine vessels.) Every retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer shall use nozzles meeting these specifications for any new construction or for nozzle replacements. This does not require replacement of existing nozzles for refueling marine vessels before they would be replaced for other reasons. The following specifications apply to spouts on new or replacement nozzles intended for dispensing gasoline into marine vessels:
              (1) The outside diameter of the terminal end shall have a diameter of 0.824 ±0.017 inches (2.093 ±0.043 centimeters).
              (2) The spout shall include an aspirator hole for automatic shutoff positioned with a center that is 0.67 ±0.05 inches (1.70 ±0.13 centimeters) from the terminal end of the spout.
              (3) The terminal end shall have a straight section of at least 2.5 inches (6.34 centimeters) with no holes or grooves other than the aspirator hole.
              (4) The retaining spring (if applicable) shall terminate at least 3.0 inches (7.6 centimeters) from the terminal end.
              (h)-(i) [Reserved]
              (j) After July 1, 1996 every retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer handling over 10,000 gallons (37,854 liters) of fuel per month shall limit each nozzle from which gasoline or methanol is introduced into motor vehicles to a maximum fuel flow rate not to exceed 10 gallons per minute (37.9 liters per minute). The flow rate may be controlled through any means in the pump/dispenser system, provided the nozzle flow rate does not exceed 10 gallons per minute (37.9 liters per minute). After January 1, 1998 this requirement applies to every retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer. Any dispensing pump that is dedicated exclusively to heavy-duty vehicles, boats, or airplanes is exempt from this requirement.

              Liability for violations.
              Liability for violations of paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 80.22 shall be determined as follows:
              (a)(1) Where the corporate, trade, or brand name of a gasoline refiner or any of its marketing subsidiaries appears on the pump stand or is displayed at the retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility from which the gasoline was sold, dispensed, or offered for sale, the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, the reseller (if any), and such gasoline refiner shall be deemed in violation. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the refiner shall be deemed in violation irrespective of whether any other refiner, distributor, retailer, or wholesale purchaser-consumer or the employee or agent of any refiner, distributor, retailer, or wholesale purchaser-consumer may have caused or permitted the violation.
              (2) Where the corporate, trade, or brand name of a gasoline refiner or any of its marketing subsidiaries does not appear on the pump stand and is not displayed at the retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility from which the gasoline was sold, dispensed, or offered for sale, the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer and any distributor who sold that person gasoline contained in the storage tank which supplied that pump at the time of the violation shall be deemed in violation.
              (b)(1) In any case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer and any gasoline refiner or distributor would be in violation under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall not be liable if he can demonstrate that the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent.

              (2) In any case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, a reseller (if any), and any gasoline refiner would be in violation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the refiner shall not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate:
              (i) That the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent, and
              (ii) That the violation was caused by an act in violation of law (other than the Act or this part), or an act of sabotage, vandalism, or deliberate commingling of gasoline which is produced with the use of lead additives or phosphorus additives with unleaded gasoline, whether or not such acts are violations of law in the jurisdiction where the violation of the requirements of this part occurred, or
              (iii) That the violation was caused by the action of a reseller or a retailer supplied by such reseller, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such reseller designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or
              (iv) That the violation was caused by the action of a retailer who is supplied directly by the refiner (and not by a reseller), in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such retailer designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or
              (v) That the violation was caused by the action of a distributor subject to a contract with the refiner for transportation of gasoline from a terminal to a distributor, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such distributor designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or
              (vi) That the violation was caused by a distributor (such as a common carrier) not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by him for transportation of gasoline from a terminal to a distributor, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as specification or inspection of equipment) to prevent such action, or

              (vii) That the violation occurred at a wholesale purchaser-consumer facility: Provided, however, That if such wholesale purchaser-consumer was supplied by a reseller, the refiner must demonstrate that the violation could not have been prevented by such reseller's compliance with a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such reseller as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
              (viii) In paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (vi) hereof, the term “was caused” means that the refiner must demonstrate by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.
              (c) In any case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, a reseller, and any gasoline refiner would be in violation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the reseller shall not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate that the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent.
              (d) In any case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer and any gasoline distributor would be in violation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the distributor will not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate that the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent.
              (e)(1) In any case in which a retailer or his employee or agent or a wholesale purchase-consumer or his employee or agent introduced gasoline other than unleaded gasoline into a motor vehicle which is equipped with a gasoline tank filler inlet designed for the introduction of unleaded gasoline, only the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall be deemed in violation.

              (3) An appropriate purpose is limited to research or emissions certification. The testing exemption application must include a concise statement of the purpose(s) of the testing program.
              (4) With respect to the necessity that an exemption be granted, the applicant must demonstrate an inability to achieve the stated purpose in a practicable manner, during a period of the year in which the volatility regulations do not apply, or without performing or causing to be performed one or more of the prohibited activities under § 80.27(a). If any site of the proposed test program is located in an area that has been classified by the Administrator as a nonattainment area for purposes of the ozone national ambient air quality standard, the application must also demonstrate an inability to perform the test program in an area that is not so classified.

              (5) With respect to reasonableness, a test program must exhibit a duration of reasonable length, effect a reasonable number of vehicles or engines, and utilize a reasonable amount of high volatility fuel. In this regard, the testing exemption application must include:
              (i) An estimate of the program's duration;
              (ii) An estimate of the maximum number of vehicles or engines involved in the test program;
              (iii) The time or mileage duration of the test program;
              (iv) The range of volatility of the fuel (expressed in Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP)) expected to be used in the test program; and
              (v) The quantity of fuel which exceeds the applicable standard that is expected to be used in the test program.
              (6) With respect to control, a test program must be capable of affording EPA a monitoring capability. At a minimum, the testing exemption application must also include:
              (i) The technical nature of the test program;
              (ii) The site(s) of the test program (including the street address, city, county, State, and zip code);
              (iii) The manner in which information on vehicles and engines used in the test program will be recorded and made available to the Administrator;
              (iv) The manner in which results of the test program will be recorded and made available to the Administrator;
              (v) The manner in which information on the fuel used in the test program (including RVP level(s), name, address, telephone number, and contact person of supplier, quantity, date received from the supplier) will be recorded and made available to the Administrator;
              (vi) The manner in which the distribution pumps will be labeled to insure proper use of the test fuel;
              (vii) The name, address, telephone number and title of the person(s) in the organization requesting a testing exemption from whom further information on the request may be obtained; and
              (viii) The name, address, telephone number and title of the person(s) in the organization requesting a testing exemption who will be responsible for recording and making available to the Administrator the information specified in paragraphs (e)(6)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section, and the location in which such information will be maintained.
              (7) A testing exemption will be granted by the Administrator upon a demonstration that the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section have been met. The testing exemption will be granted in the form of a memorandum of exemption signed by the applicant and the Administrator (or his delegate), which shall include such terms and conditions as the Administrator determines necessary to monitor the exemption and to carry out the purposes of this section. Any violation of such a term or condition shall cause the exemption to be void.

              (2) In any case in which a refiner or importer would be in violation under paragraphs (b)(2), (d)(3), or (f)(5) of this section, the refiner or importer shall not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate:
              (i) That the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent; and
              (ii) Test results using the sampling methodology set forth in § 80.8 and the testing methodology set forth in § 80.46(c), or any other test method where adequate correlation to § 80.46(c) is demonstrated, which show evidence that the gasoline determined to be in violation was in compliance with the applicable standard when it was delivered to the next party in the distribution system.
              (3) In any case in which a distributor or reseller would be in violation under paragraph (b)(4), (c)(1), (d)(1), (e)(2), or (f)(2) of this section, the distributor or reseller shall not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate:
              (i) That the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent; and
              (ii) Evidence of an oversight program conducted by the distributor or reseller, such as periodic sampling and testing of gasoline, for monitoring the volatility of gasoline that the distributor or reseller sells, supplies, offers for sale or supply, or transports.
              (4) In any case in which a refiner would be in violation under paragraphs (c)(3) or (e)(4) of this section, the refiner shall not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate all of the following:
              (i) Test results using the sampling methodology set forth in § 80.8 and the testing methodology set forth in § 80.46(c), or any other test method where adequate correlation to § 80.46(c) is demonstrated, which show evidence that the gasoline determined to be in violation was in compliance with the applicable standard when transported from the refinery.
              (ii) That the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent; and
              (iii) That the violation:
              (A) Was caused by an act in violation of law (other than the Act or this part), or an act of sabotage or vandalism, whether or not such acts are violations of law in the jurisdiction where the violation of the requirements of this part occurred, or
              (B) Was caused by the action of a reseller, an ethanol blender, or a retailer supplied by such reseller or ethanol blender, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such reseller or ethanol blender designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling and testing) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or
              (C) Was caused by the action of a retailer who is supplied directly by the refiner (and not by a reseller), in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such retailer designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling and testing) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or

              (D) Was caused by the action of a distributor or an ethanol blender subject to a contract with the refiner for transportation of gasoline from a terminal to a distributor, ethanol blender, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such distributor or ethanol blender designed to prevent such action, and despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as periodic sampling and testing) to insure compliance with such contractual obligation, or
              (E) Was caused by a carrier or other distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by him for transportation of gasoline from a terminal to a distributor, ethanol blender, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, despite reasonable efforts by the refiner (such as specification or inspection of equipment) to prevent such action, or

              (F) Occurred at a wholesale purchaser-consumer facility: Provided, however, That if such wholesale purchaser-consumer was supplied by a reseller or ethanol blender, the refiner must demonstrate that the violation could not have been prevented by such reseller's or ethanol blender's compliance with a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner on such reseller or ethanol blender as provided in paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(B) of this section.
              (iv) In paragraphs (g)(4)(iii)(A) through (E) of this section, the term “was caused” means that the refiner must demonstrate by reasonably specific showings, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.
              (5) In any case in which a retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer would be in violation under paragraphs (e)(1) or (f)(1) of this section, the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate that the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent.
              (6) In any case in which an ethanol blender would be in violation under paragraphs (b)(3), (c)(4), (d)(4), (e)(5) or (f)(4) of this section, the ethanol blender shall not be deemed in violation if he can demonstrate:
              (i) That the violation was not caused by him or his employee or agent; and
              (ii) Evidence of an oversight program conducted by the ethanol blender, such as periodic sampling and testing of gasoline, for monitoring the volatility of gasoline that the ethanol blender sells, supplies, offers for sale or supply or transports; and
              (iii) That the gasoline determined to be in violation contained no more than 15% ethanol (by volume) when it was delivered to the next party in the distribution system.
              (7) In paragraphs (g)(1)(i), (g)(2)(i), (g)(3)(i), (g)(4)(ii), (g)(5), and (g)(6)(i) of this section, the respective party must demonstrate by reasonably specific showings, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that it or its employee or agent did not cause the violation.
              (8) In addition to the defenses provided in paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section, in any case in which an ethanol blender, distributor, reseller, carrier, retailer, or wholesale purchaser-consumer would be in violation under paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as a result of gasoline which contains between 9 and 15 percent ethanol (by volume) but exceeds the applicable standard by more than one pound per square inch (1.0 psi), the ethanol blender, distributor, reseller, carrier, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer shall not be deemed in violation if such person can demonstrate, by showing receipt of a certification from the facility from which the gasoline was received or other evidence acceptable to the Administrator, that:
              (i) The gasoline portion of the blend complies with the Reid vapor pressure limitations of § 80.27(a); and
              (ii) The ethanol portion of the blend does not exceed 15 percent (by volume); and
              (iii) No additional alcohol or other additive has been added to increase the Reid vapor pressure of the ethanol portion of the blend.

              In the case of a violation alleged against an ethanol blender, distributor, reseller, or carrier, if the demonstration required by paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section is made by a certification, it must be supported by evidence that the criteria in paragraphs (g)(8)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section have been met, such as an oversight program conducted by or on behalf of the ethanol blender, distributor, reseller or carrier alleged to be in violation, which includes periodic sampling and testing of the gasoline or monitoring the volatility and ethanol content of the gasoline. Such certification shall be deemed sufficient evidence of compliance provided it is not contradicted by specific evidence, such as testing results, and provided that the party has no other reasonable basis to believe that the facts stated in the certification are inaccurate. In the case of a violation alleged against a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility, such certification shall be deemed an adequate defense for the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, provided that the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer is able to show certificates for all of the gasoline contained in the storage tank found in violation, and, provided that the retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer has no reasonable basis to believe that the facts stated in the certifications are inaccurate.

              (1) Has a sulfur percentage, by weight, no greater than 0.05 percent;
              (2)(i) Has a cetane index of at least 40; or
              (ii) Has a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent; and
              (3) Is free of visible evidence of the dye solvent red 164; unless it is used in a manner that is tax-exempt as defined under section 4082 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 4082).
              (b) Determination of compliance. (1) Any diesel fuel which does not show visible evidence of being dyed with dye solvent red 164 (which has a characteristic red color in diesel fuel) shall be considered to be available for use in diesel motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines, and shall be subject to the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section.
              (2) Compliance with the sulfur, cetane, and aromatics standards in paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined based on the level of the applicable component or parameter, using the sampling methodologies specified in § 80.330(b), as applicable, and the appropriate testing methodologies specified in § 80.580(a) for sulfur, § 80.2(w) for cetane index, and § 80.2(z) for aromatic content. Any evidence or information, including the exclusive use of such evidence or information, may be used to establish the level of the applicable component or parameter in the diesel fuel, if the evidence or information is relevant to whether that level would have been in compliance with the standard if the appropriate sampling and testing methodology had been correctly performed. Such evidence may be obtained from any source or location and may include, but is not limited to, test results using methods other than the compliance methods in this paragraph (b), business records, and commercial documents.
              (3) Determination of compliance with the requirements of this section other than the standards described in paragraph (a) of this section, and determination of liability for any violation of this section, may be based on information obtained from any source or location. Such information may include, but is not limited to, business records and commercial documents.
              (c) Transfer documents. (1) Any person that transfers custody or title of diesel fuel for use in motor vehicles which contains visible evidence of the dye solvent red 164 shall provide documents to the transferee which state that such fuel meets the applicable standards for sulfur and cetane index or aromatic content under these regulations and is only for tax-exempt use in diesel motor vehicles as defined under section 4082 of the Internal Revenue Code.

              (2) Any person that is the transferor or the transferee of diesel fuel for use in motor vehicles which contains visible evidence of the dye solvent red 164, shall retain the documents required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for a period of five years from the date of transfer of such fuel and shall provide such documents to the Administrator or the Administrator's representative upon request.
              (d) Liability. Liability for violations of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be determined according to the provisions of § 80.30. Any person that violates paragraph (a)(2) or (c) of this section shall be liable for penalties in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
              (e) Penalties. Penalties for violations of paragraph (a) or (c) of this section shall be determined according to the provisions of § 80.5.

              § 80.40
              Fuel certification procedures.
              (a) Gasoline that complies with one of the standards specified in § 80.41 (a) through (f) that is relevant for the gasoline, and that meets all other relevant requirements prescribed under § 80.41, shall be deemed certified.
              (b) Any refiner or importer may, with regard to a specific fuel formulation, request from the Administrator a certification that the formulation meets one of the standards specified in § 80.41 (a) through (f).
              (c)(1) Adjusted VOC gasoline for purposes of the general requirements in 80.65(d)(2)(ii), and the certification procedures in this section is gasoline that contains 10 to 15 volume percent ethanol, or RBOB intended for blending with 10 to 15 volume percent ethanol, that is intended for use in the areas described at 80.70(f) and (i), and is designated by the refiner as adjusted VOC gasoline subject to less stringent VOC standards in 80.41(e) and (f). In order for adjusted VOC gasoline to qualify for the regulatory treatment specified in 80.41(e) and (f), reformulated gasoline must contain denatured, anhydrous ethanol. The concentration of the ethanol, excluding the required denaturing agent, must be at least 9 percent and no more than 15 percent (by volume) of the gasoline. The ethanol content of the gasoline shall be determined by use of one of the testing methodologies specified in 80.46(g).
              (2) Refiners may choose not to designate as adjusted VOC gasoline or RBOB that otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in which case the more stringent VOC standards in § 80.41 apply.
              (3) For purposes of § 80.78(a)(1)(v), the “Adjusted VOC gasoline” standards under § 80.41 are the applicable VOC emissions performance standards only for adjusted VOC gasoline that is intended for use in or sold for use by an ultimate consumer in the covered areas described at § 80.70(f) and (i). For purposes of § 80.78(a)(1)(v), gasoline designated as adjusted VOC gasoline that is intended for use or that is sold for use by an ultimate consumer in any covered area in VOC-Control Region 2 other than those described at § 80.70(f) and (i), is subject to the VOC performance standards in § 80.41 applicable to all other gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 2.

              (3)(i) Beginning January 1, 2011, or January 1, 2015 for small refiners approved under § 80.1340, the toxic air pollutants emissions performance reduction and benzene content specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall apply only to reformulated gasoline that is not subject to the benzene standard of § 80.1230, pursuant to the provisions of § 80.1235.
              (ii) The toxic air pollutants emissions performance reduction and benzene content specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall not apply to reformulated gasoline produced by a refinery approved under § 80.1334, pursuant to § 80.1334(c).
              (g) Oxygen maximum standard. (1) The per-gallon standard for maximum oxygen content, which applies to reformulated gasoline subject to the simple model per-gallon or average standards, is as follows:
              (i) Oxygen content shall not exceed 3.2 percent by weight from ethanol within the boundaries of any State if the State notifies the Administrator that the use of an oxygenate will interfere with attainment or maintenance of an ambient air quality standard or will contribute to an air quality problem.
              (ii) A State may request the standard specified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section separately for reformulated gasoline designated as VOC-controlled and reformulated gasoline not designated as VOC-controlled.

              (2) The standard in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section shall apply 60 days after the Administrator publishes a notice in the Federal Register announcing such a standard.
              (h) Additional standard requirements. In addition to the standards specified in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, the following standards apply for all reformulated gasoline:
              (1) The standard for heavy metals, including lead or manganese, on a per-gallon basis, is that reformulated gasoline may contain no heavy metals. The Administrator may waive this prohibition for a heavy metal (other than lead) if the Administrator determines that addition of the heavy metal to the gasoline will not increase, on an aggregate mass or cancer-risk basis, toxic air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles.
              (2) In the case of any refinery or importer subject to the simple model standards:
              (i) The annual average levels for sulfur, T-90, and olefins cannot exceed that refinery's or importer's 1990 baseline levels for each of these parameters; and
              (ii) The 1990 baseline levels and the annual averages for these parameters shall be established using the methodology set forth in §§ 80.91 through 80.92; and
              (iii) In the case of a refiner that operates more than one refinery, the standards specified under this paragraph (h)(2) shall be met using the refinery grouping selected by the refiner under § 80.101(h).
              (i) Use of simple and complex models. (1) During each calendar year 1995 through 1997, any refinery or importer shall be subject to either the simple model standards specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, or the Phase I complex model standards specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, at the option of the refiner or importer, provided that:
              (i) No refinery or importer may be subject to a combination of simple and complex standards during any calendar year; and
              (ii) Any refiner or importer that elects to achieve compliance with the anti-dumping requirements using the:
              (A) Simple model shall meet the requirements of this subpart D using the simple model standards; or
              (B) Complex model or optional complex model shall meet the requirements of this subpart D using the complex model standards.

              (2) During the period January 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999, any refiner or importer shall be subject to the Phase I complex model standards specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
              (3) Beginning on January 1, 2000, any refiner or importer shall be subject to the Phase II complex model standards specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
              (j) Complex model early use. Before January 1, 1998, the VOC, toxics, and NOX emissions performance standards for any refinery or importer subject to the Phase I complex model standards shall be determined by evaluating all of the following parameter levels in the Phase I complex model (specified in § 80.45) at one time:
              (1) The simple model values for benzene, RVP, and oxygen specified in § 80.41 (a) or (b), as applicable;
              (2) The aromatics value which, together with the values for benzene, RVP, and oxygen determined under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, meets the Simple Model toxics requirement specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as applicable;
              (3) The refinery's or importer's individual baseline values for sulfur, E-300, and olefins, as established under § 80.91; and
              (4) The appropriate seasonal value of E-200 specified in § 80.45(b)(2).
              (k) Effect of VOC survey failure.

              (3) In the event that a covered area for which the toxics emissions standard has been made more stringent passes all toxics emissions survey series in two consecutive years, the averaging standard for toxics emissions reductions for that covered area beginning in the year following the second year of passed survey series shall be made less stringent by decreasing the average toxics emissions reduction by 1.0%.
              (4) In the event that a covered area for which the toxics emissions reduction standard has been made less stringent fails a subsequent toxics emissions reduction survey series:
              (i) The standard for toxics emissions reduction for that covered area beginning in the year following this subsequent failure shall be made more stringent by increasing the average toxics emissions reduction by 1.0%; and
              (ii) The standard for toxics emissions reduction for that covered area thereafter shall not be made less stringent regardless of the results of subsequent toxics emissions reduction surveys.
              (m) Effect of NO

              (n) Effect of benzene survey failure. (1) On each occasion that a covered area fails a benzene content survey series, conducted pursuant to § 80.68, the benzene content standards for that covered area beginning in the year following the year of the failure shall be made more stringent as follows:
              (i) The average benzene content shall be decreased by 0.05% by volume; and
              (ii) The maximum benzene content for each gallon of averaged gasoline shall be decreased by 0.10% by volume.
              (2) In the event that a covered area for which the benzene standards have been made more stringent passes all benzene content survey series conducted in two consecutive years, the benzene standards for that covered area beginning in the year following the second year of passed survey series shall be made less stringent as follows:

              (ii) The standards for benzene content for that covered area thereafter shall not be made less stringent regardless of the results of subsequent benzene content surveys.
              (o) [Reserved]
              (p) Effective date for changed minimum or maximum standards. In the case of any minimum or maximum standard that is changed to be more stringent by operation of paragraphs (k), (m), (n), or (o) of this section, the effective date for such change shall be the following number of days after the date EPA announces the change:

              § 80.47
              Performance-based Analytical Test Method Approach.
              All sample handling, testing procedures, and tests must be conducted using good laboratory practices.
              (a) Definitions. As used in this subpart D:
              (1) Performance-based Analytical Test Method Approach means a measurement system based upon established performance criteria for accuracy and precision with use of analytical test methods. As used in this subpart, this is a measurement system used by laboratories to demonstrate that a particular analytical test method is acceptable for demonstrating compliance.
              (2) Accuracy means the closeness of agreement between an observed value from a single test measurement and an accepted reference value.
              (3) Precision means the degree of agreement in a set of measurements performed on the same property of identical test material.
              (4) Absolute fuel parameter means a fuel parameter for which a gravimetric standard is practical to construct and use. Sulfur content of gasoline, butane, or diesel fuel are examples of an absolute fuel parameter.
              (5) Gravimetric standard means a test material made by adding a carefully weighed quantity of the analyte to a measured quantity of another substance known not to contain any of the analyte, resulting in a solution with an accurately known concentrate of the analyte.
              (6) Consensus named fuels are homogeneous quantities of fuel that have been analyzed by a number of different laboratories (by sending around small samples). The average concentration of some parameter of interest across all of the different laboratories is then used as the “consensus name” for that material.
              (7) Locally-named reference materials are gasoline or diesel fuels that are usually from the regular production of the facility where they are used in laboratory quality control efforts and have been analyzed using the designated method (either by the facility's lab or by a reference lab) to obtain an estimate of their concentration.
              (8) Method-defined fuel parameter means a fuel parameter for which an EPA-prescribed primary test method or designated method defines the regulatory standard. Examples of method-defined fuel parameters include olefin content in gasoline, Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of gasoline, distillation parameters of gasoline, benzene content of gasoline, aromatic content of gasoline and diesel fuel, and oxygen/oxygenates content of gasoline.
              (9) Reference installations are designated test method installations that are used to qualify the accuracy of other method-defined parameter instruments. Reference installations of the designated test method will be used to evaluate the accuracy of other method-defined alternative test methods and to establish correlation equations if necessary.
              (10) Correlation equation is a correction equation as determined by the use of ASTM D6708.

Specifically, compute the difference between the instrument's average measurement of the fuel closest to the applicable fuel standard (or to the average value for the fuel parameter in the complex model) and the mean for that fuel obtained by all of the non-outlier labs in the monthly inter-laboratory crosscheck program. Standardize this difference by expressing it in standard deviation units. These standardized inter-laboratory crosscheck differences should be placed in a moving average with a minimum span of five months. The instrument's moving average in standard deviation units cannot be outside the central 50% of the distribution of all laboratories that participated in the inter-laboratory crosscheck program.
              (3) The reference installation of the method-defined fuel parameter for the applicable designated test method must be shown to be in statistical quality control as specified in ASTM D6299 for a minimum period of five months using good laboratory practices.

              (ii) If an assignable cause for `out of control' is found, mitigated, and the system is brought back in statistical quality control during the five month time period that the reference installation is attempting to meet the five month in-statistical-control requirement, the five month time period does not re-start and the system is still considered to be `in-control'.

              (4) For a voluntary consensus standards body, such as ASTM, or for a commercially available industry crosscheck program, the summary statistics (mean and standard error = standard deviation/square root [number of results]) from the VCSB or commercially available inter-laboratory cross-check program (ILCP) data may be used as is without imposing the reference installations requirements of this section, provided that the number of non-outlying results is greater than 16 for both the designated and alternative test methods. The determination of ARV of check standards as specified in ASTM D6299, clause 6.2.2.1 and Note 7 shall be followed for the inter-laboratory crosscheck program. The use of VCSB or commercially available ILCP data as described above is deemed suitable for an ASTM D6708 assessment of VCSB alternative test methods.

              (2)(i) The test facility or VCSB include information reported in the test method that demonstrates the test method meets the applicable precision information for the method-defined fuel parameter as described in this section.
              (ii) For the Non-VCSB absolute fuel parameter of sulfur in gasoline and butane, the test facility include information reported in the test method that demonstrates the applicable accuracy criteria as described in § 80.47(b)(2) for gasoline and § 80.47(c)(2) for butane.
              (3) The test facility or VCSB include information reported in the test method that demonstrates the test method has been evaluated using ASTM D6708 and whether the comparison is a “null” result or whether a correlation equation needs to be applied that predicts designated test method results from the applicable method-defined alternative test method.
              (4) The test methods specified at §§ 80.2(w) and 80.46(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), (e)(1), (f)(1), and (g)(1) and in use by a test facility prior to October 28, 2013 are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (l)(1) through (3) of this section.

              (1) Beginning January 1, 2016, full and thorough test method documentation, including a description of the technology and/or instrumentation that makes the method functional so a person lacking experience with the test instrument would be able to replicate its results.
              (2) Information reported in the test method that demonstrates the test method meets the applicable precision information using good laboratory practices for the method-defined fuel parameter as described in this section.
              (3) Both the candidate method-defined Non-VCSB test method and its respective designated test method must be tested on a range of consensus named fuels or locally-named reference materials that are typical of those analyzed by the facility in practice using good laboratory practices and must meet the data requirements for variability as required in ASTM D6708.
              (4) The facility using the candidate method-defined non-VCSB test method must statistically establish through application of ASTM D6708 that the candidate method measures the same aspect of samples as applicable to its respective designated test method using good laboratory practices.

              (5) If the use of ASTM D6708 reveals that the candidate method-defined non-VCSB test method has sample-specific biases due to matrix effects that cannot be determined as random the method is disqualified. If however, it is determined that the candidate method-defined non-VCSB test method can be qualified on a narrow circumscribed range of fuels while still meeting the data requirements for variability as required in ASTM D6708 (see paragraph (m)(3) of this section), then the types of fuels on which the qualification was achieved and for which the method is to be approved must be specified in the candidate method-defined non-VCSB test method description. If there is any restriction on the scope of fuels for which the candidate method-defined non-VCSB test method is to be qualified, the applicant must include a discussion of how the facility plans to screen sample for conformity to the scope. If the candidate method-defined test method is found to have minimal matrix effects, a statement to this effect must be included by the applicant in its application.
              (6) The candidate method-defined non-VCSB test method precision qualification must be conducted in the form of “between methods reproducibility” (Rcm) of the candidate method and applicable designated test method as recommended in ASTM D6708, where the Rcm must be equal to or less than 70 percent of the published reproducibility of the applicable designated test method using good laboratory practices.
              (7) The applicant of the candidate method-defined non-VCSB test method must demonstrate through the use of ASTM D6708 whether a correlation to applicable designated test method is necessary. If it is determined through the use of this practice that the candidate method-defined non-VCSB test method requires a correlation equation in order to predict designated test method results, then this correlation equation must be applied to the candidate instruments output to obtain measurement results for regulatory purposes using good laboratory practices.
              (8) Any additional information requested by the Administrator and necessary to render a decision as to approval of the test method.
              (9) Samples used for precision and accuracy determination must be retained for 90 days.
              (10) Within 90 days of the receipt of materials required to be submitted under paragraphs (m)(1) through (9) of this section, the Administrator shall determine whether the test method is approved under this section.
              (11) If the Administrator denies approval of the test method, within 90 days of receipt of all materials required to be submitted in paragraphs (m)(1) through (9) of this section, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the reasons for not approving the method. If the Administrator does not notify the applicant within 90 days of receipt of the application, then the test method shall be deemed approved.
              (12) The Administrator may revoke approval of a test method under this section for cause, including, but not limited to, a determination by the Administrator that the approved test method has proved to be inadequate in practice.

The facility must construct “MR” and “I” charts with control lines as described in section 8.4 and appropriate Annex sections of this standard practice. In circumstances where the absolute difference between the mean of multiple back-to-back tests of the standard reference material and the accepted reference value of the standard reference material is greater than 0.75 times the published reproducibility of the test method, the cause of such difference must be investigated by the facility. Records of the standard reference materials measurements as well as any investigations into any exceedance of these criteria must be kept for a period of five years.
              (ii) The expanded uncertainty of the accepted reference value of consensus named fuels shall have the following accuracy qualification criterion: Accuracy qualification criterion = square root [(0.75R)^2 + (0.75R)^2/L], where L = the number of single results obtained from different labs used to calculate the consensus ARV.
              (2)(i) Precision SQC. Every facility shall conduct tests on every instrument with a quality control material as defined in paragraph 3.2.8 in ASTM D6299 either once per week or once per every 20 production tests, whichever is more frequent. The facility must construct and maintain an “I” chart as described in section 8 and section A1.5.1 and a “MR” chart as described in section A1.5.4. Any violations of control limit(s) should be investigated by personnel of the facility and records kept for a period of five years.
              (ii) Validation of New QC Material. When a test facility is making a transition from one batch of QC material to the next batch of QC material, the facility will either construct an “I” chart as described in section 8.7 and section A1.5.1 of ASTM D6299, or follow the “Q-Procedure” in Annex 1.9 of ASTM D6299. In following the Q-Procedure, if the plot of results from the “old” and “new” QC materials on its respective chart shows no special-cause signals, then the result of the “new” QC material will be considered valid.

              (iii) For test facilities opting to use the Q-procedure, the first run on the new QC batch should be validated by either an overlap in-control result of the old batch, or by a single execution of an accompanying standard reference material. The new QC material result would be considered validated if the single result of the standard reference material is within the established site precision (R') of the Accepted Reference Value of the standard reference material, as determined by ASTM D6792.
              (iv) [Reserved]
              (v) These records must be kept by the facility for a period of five years.
              (o) Accuracy and Precision Statistical Quality Control (SQC) Requirements for the Voluntary Consensus Standard Based (VCSB) Method-Defined Fuel Parameters. Beginning January 1, 2016, a test shall not be considered a test using an approved test method unless the following quality control procedures are performed separately for each instrument used to make measurements:
              (1)(i) Accuracy SQC. Every facility shall conduct tests of every instrument with a commercially available check standard as defined in ASTM D6299 at least three times a year using good laboratory practices. The check standard must be an ordinary fuel with levels of the fuel parameter of interest close to either the applicable regulatory standard or the average level of use for the facility. For facilities using a VCSB designated method defined test method, the Accepted Reference Value of the check standard must be determined by the respective designated test method for the fuel parameter following the guidelines of ASTM D6299. Facilities using a VCSB alternative method defined test method must use the Accepted Reference Value of the check standard as determined in a VCSB Inter Laboratory Crosscheck Program (ILCP) or a commercially available ILCP following the guidelines of ASTM D6299. If the Accepted Reference Value is not provided in the ILCP, accuracy must be assessed based upon the respective EPA-designated test method using appropriate production samples. The facility must pre-treat and assess results from the check standard testing after at least 15 testing occasions as described in section 8.2 of this standard practice. The facility must construct “MR” and “I” charts with control lines as described in section 8.4 and appropriate Annex sections of this standard practice. In circumstances where the absolute difference between the mean of multiple back-to-back tests of the standard reference material and the accepted reference value of the standard reference material is greater than 0.75 times the published reproducibility of the test method, the cause of such difference must be investigated by the facility. Participation in a VCSB ILCP at least three times a year satisfies this Accuracy SQC requirement (Examples of ILCP: ASTM Reformulated Gasoline ILCP or ASTM motor gasoline ILCP). Records of the standard reference materials measurements as well as any investigations into any exceedance of these criteria must be kept for a period of five years.
              (ii) The expanded uncertainty of the accepted reference value of consensus named fuels shall have the following accuracy qualification criterion: Accuracy qualification criterion = square root [(0.75R)^2 + (0.75R)^2/L], where L = the number of single results obtained from different labs used to calculate the consensus ARV.
              (2)(i) Precision SQC. Every facility shall conduct tests of every instrument with a quality control material as defined in paragraph 3.2.8 in ASTM D6299 either once per week or once per every 20 production tests, whichever is more frequent. The facility must construct and maintain an “I” chart as described in section 8 and section A1.5.1 and a “MR” chart as described in section A1.5.4. Any violations of control limit(s) should be investigated by personnel of the facility and records kept for a period of five years.
              (ii) Validation of New QC Material. When a test facility is making a transition from one batch of QC material to the next batch of QC material, the facility will either construct an “I” chart as described in section 8.7 and section A1.5.1 of ASTM D6299, or follow the “Q-Procedure” in Annex 1.9 of ASTM D6299. In following the Q-Procedure if the plot of results from the “old” and “new” QC materials on its respective chart shows no special-cause signals, then the result of the “new” QC material will be considered valid.

              (iii) For test facilities opting to use the Q-procedure, the first run on the new QC batch should be validated by either an overlap in-control result of the old batch, or by a single execution of an accompanying standard reference material. The new QC material result would be considered validated if the single result of the standard reference material is within the established site precision (R') of the Accepted Reference Value of the standard reference material, as determined by ASTM D6792.
              (iv) [Reserved]
              (v) These records must be kept by the facility for a period of five years.
              (p) Accuracy and Precision Statistical Quality Control (SQC) Requirements for the Non-Voluntary Consensus Standard Based (Non-VCSB) Method-Defined Fuel Parameters. Beginning January 1, 2016, a test shall not be considered a test using an approved test method unless the following quality control procedures are performed separately for each instrument used to make measurements:
              (1)(i) Accuracy SQC for Non-VCSB Method-Defined test methods with minimal matrix effects. Every facility shall conduct tests on every instrument with a commercially available check standard as defined in the ASTM D6299 at least three times a year using good laboratory practices. The check standard must be an ordinary fuel with levels of the fuel parameter of interest close to either the applicable regulatory standard or the average level of use for the facility. Facilities using a Non-VCSB alternative method defined test method must use the Accepted Reference Value of the check standard as determined in either a VCSB Inter Laboratory Crosscheck Program (ILCP) or a commercially available ILCP following the guidelines of ASTM D6299. If the Accepted Reference Value is not provided in the ILCP, accuracy must be assessed based upon the respective EPA designated test method using appropriate production samples. The facility must pre-treat and assess results from the check standard testing after at least 15 testing occasions as described in section 8.2 of this standard practice. The facility must construct “MR” and “I” charts with control lines as described in section 8.4 and appropriate Annex sections of this standard practice. In circumstances where the absolute difference between the mean of multiple back-to-back tests of the standard reference material and the accepted reference value of the standard reference material is greater than 0.75 times the published reproducibility of the fuel parameter's respective designated test method, the cause of such difference must be investigated by the facility. Records of the standard reference materials measurements as well as any investigations into any exceedance of these criteria must be kept for a period of five years.
              (ii) The expanded uncertainty of the accepted reference value of consensus named fuels shall have the following accuracy qualification criterion: Accuracy qualification criterion = square root [(0.75R)^2 + (0.75R)^2/L], where L = the number of single results obtained from different labs used to calculate the consensus ARV.
              (2)(i) Accuracy SQC for Non-VCSB Method-Defined test methods with high sensitivity to matrix effects. Every facility shall conduct tests on every instrument with a production fuel on at least a quarterly basis using good laboratory practices. The production fuel must be representative of the production fuels that are routinely analyzed by the facility. The Accepted Reference Value of the production fuel must be determined by the respective reference installation of the designated test method for the fuel parameter following the guidelines of ASTM D6299. The facility must pre-treat and assess results from the check standard testing after at least 15 testing occasions as described in section 8.2 of this standard practice. The facility must construct “MR” and “I” charts with control lines as described in section 8.4 and appropriate Annex sections of this standard practice. In circumstances where the absolute difference between the mean of multiple back-to-back tests of the standard reference material and the accepted reference value of the standard reference material is greater than 0.75 times the published reproducibility of the test method must be investigated by the facility. Documentation on the identity of the reference installation and its control status must be maintained on the premises of the method-defined alternative test method. Records of the standard reference materials measurements as well as any investigations into any exceedances of this criterion must be kept for a period of five years.

              (ii) Each facility is required to send every 20th production batch of gasoline or diesel fuel to EPA's laboratory, along with the facility's measurement result used to certify the batch using the respective method-defined non-VCSB test method. The EPA retains the right to return such sample on a blind basis for a required reanalysis on the respective method-defined non-VCSB test method within 180 days upon receipt of such sample.
              (3)(i) Precision SQC. Every facility shall conduct tests on every instrument with a quality control material as defined in paragraph 3.2.8 in ASTM D6299 either once per week or once per every 20 production tests, whichever is more frequent. The facility must construct and maintain an “I” chart as described in section 8 and section A1.5.1 and a “MR” chart as described in section A1.5.4. Any violations of control limit(s) should be investigated by personnel of the facility and records kept for a period of five years.
              (ii) Validation of New QC Material. When a test facility is making a transition from one batch of QC material to the next batch of QC material, the facility will either construct an “I” chart as described in section 8.7 and section A1.5.1 of ASTM D6299, or follow the “Q-Procedure” in Annex 1.9 of ASTM D6299. In following the Q-Procedure, if the plot of results from the “old” and “new” QC materials on its respective chart shows no special-cause signals, then the result of the “new” QC material will be considered valid.
              (iii) For test facilities opting to use the Q-procedure, the first run on the new QC batch should be validated by either an overlap in-control result of the old batch, or by a single execution of an accompanying standard reference material. The new QC material result would be considered validated if the single result of the standard reference material is within the established site precision (R') of the Accepted Reference Value of the standard reference material, as determined by ASTM D6792.
              (iv) [Reserved]
              (v) These records must be kept by the facility for a period of five years.
              (q) Record retention requirements for the test methods approved under this subpart. Each individual test facility must retain records related to the establishment of accuracy and precision values, all test method documentation, and any statistical quality control testing and analysis under this section using good laboratory practices for a period for five years.

              [79 FR 23633, Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 9091, Feb. 19, 2015]
            
            
              § 80.48
              Augmentation of the complex emission model by vehicle testing.
              (a) The provisions of this section apply only if a fuel claims emission reduction benefits from fuel parameters that are not included in the complex emission model or complex emission model database, or if the values of fuel parameters included in the complex emission model set forth in § 80.45 fall outside the range of values for which the complex emission model is deemed valid.
              (b) To augment the complex emission model described at § 80.45, the following requirements apply:
              (1) The petitioner must obtain prior approval from the Administrator for the design of the test program before beginning the vehicle testing process. To obtain approval, the petitioner must at minimum provide the following information: the fuel parameter to be evaluated for emission effects; the number and description of vehicles to be used in the test fleet, including model year, model name, vehicle identification number (VIN), mileage, emission performance (exhaust THC emission level), technology type, and manufacturer; a description of the methods used to procure and prepare the vehicles; the properties of the fuels to be used in the testing program (as specified at § 80.49); the pollutants and emission categories intended to be evaluated; the precautions used to ensure that the effects of the parameter in question are independent of the effects of other parameters already included in the model; a description of the quality assurance procedures to be used during the test program; the statistical analysis techniques to be used in analyzing the test data, and the identity and location of the organization performing the testing.
              (2) Exhaust emissions shall be measured per the requirements of this section and § 80.49 through § 80.62.
              (3) The nonexhaust emission model (including evaporative, running loss, and refueling VOC and toxics emissions) shall not be augmented by vehicle testing.
              (4) The Agency reserves the right to observe and monitor any testing that is performed pursuant to the requirements of this section.
              (5) The Agency reserves the right to evaluate the quality and suitability of data submitted pursuant to the requirements of this section and to reject, re-analyze, or otherwise evaluate such data as is technically warranted.

              (6) Upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator, the Administrator may approve a petition to waive the requirements of this section and § 80.49, § 80.50(a), § 80.60(d)(3), and § 80.60(d)(4) in order to better optimize the test program to the needs of the particular fuel parameter. Any such waiver petition should provide information justifying the requested waiver, including an acceptable rationale and supporting data. Petitioners must obtain approval from the Administrator prior to conducting testing for which the requirements in question are waived. The Administrator may waive the noted requirements in whole or in part, and may impose appropriate conditions on any such waiver.
              (c) In the case of petitions to augment the complex model defined at § 80.45 with a new parameter, the effect of the parameter being tested shall be determined separately, for each pollutant and for each emitter class category. If the parameter is not included in the complex model but is represented in whole or in part by one or more parameters included in the model, the petitioner shall be required to demonstrate the emission effects of the parameter in question independent of the effects of the already-included parameters. The petitioner shall also have to demonstrate the effects of the already-included parameters independent of the effects of the parameter in question. The emission performance of each vehicle on the fuels specified at § 80.49, as measured through vehicle testing in accordance with § 80.50 through § 80.62, shall be analyzed to determine the effects of the fuel parameter being tested on emissions according to the following procedure:
              (1) The analysis shall fit a regression model to the natural logarithm of emissions measured from addition fuels 1, 2, and 3 only (as specified at § 80.49(a) and adjusted as per paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section and § 80.49(d)) that includes the following terms:

              (i) A term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form Di × Vi, where Di is the coefficient for the term and Vi is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles.

              (ii) A linear term in the parameter being tested for each emitter class, of the form Ai × (P1−P1 (avg)) × Ei, where Ai is the coefficient for the term, P1 is the level of the parameter in question, P1 (avg) is the average level of the parameter in question for all seven test fuels specified at § 80.49(a)(1), and Ei is a dummy variable representing emitter class, as defined at § 80.62. For normal emitters, E1 = 1 and E2 = 0. For higher emitters, E1 = 0 and E2 = 1.
              (iii) For the VOC and NOX models, a squared term in the parameter being tested for each emitter class, of the form Bi × (P1−P1 (avg))2 × Ei, where Bi is the coefficient for the term and where P1 , P1 (avg), and Ei are as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (iv) To the extent that the properties of fuels 1, 2, and 3 which are incorporated in the complex model differ in value among the three fuels, the complex model shall be used to adjust the observed emissions from test vehicles on those fuels to compensate for those differences prior to fitting the regression model.
              (v) The Ai and Bi terms and coefficients developed by the regression described in this paragraph (c) shall be evaluated against the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section. If both terms satisfy these criteria, then both terms shall be retained. If the Bi term satisfies these criteria and the Ai term does not, then both terms shall be retained. If the Bi term does not satisfy these criteria, then the Bi term shall be dropped from the regression model and the model shall be re-estimated. If, after dropping the Bi term and re-estimating the model, the Ai term does not satisfy these criteria, then both terms shall be dropped, all test data shall be reported to EPA, and the augmentation request shall be denied.

              (2) After completing the steps outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the analysis shall fit a regression model to a combined data set that includes vehicle testing results from all seven addition fuels specified at § 80.49(a), the vehicle testing results used to develop the model specified at § 80.45, and vehicle testing results used to support any prior augmentation requests which the Administrator deems necessary.
              (i) The analysis shall fit the regression models described in paragraphs (c)(2) (ii) through (v) of this section to the natural logarithm of measured emissions.

              (ii) All regressions shall include a term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form Di × Vi, where Di is the coefficient for the term and Vi is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles. Vehicles shall be represented by separate terms for each test program in which they were tested. The vehicle terms for the vehicles included in the test program undertaken by the petitioner shall be calculated based on the results from all seven fuels specified at § 80.49(a). Note that the Di estimates for the petitioner's test vehicles in this regression are likely to differ from the Di estimates discussed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section since they will be based on a different set of fuels.
              (iii) All regressions shall include existing complex model terms and their coefficients, including those augmentations that the Administrator deems necessary. All terms and coefficients shall be expressed in centered form. The Administrator shall make available upon request existing complex model terms and coefficients in centered form.
              (iv) All regressions shall include the linear and squared terms, and their coefficients, estimated in the final regression model described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
              (v) The VOC and NOX regressions shall include those interactive terms with other fuel parameters, of the form Ci(1, j) × (P1 − P1 (avg)) × (Pj − Pj (avg)) × Ei, where Ci(1, j) is the coefficient for the term, P1 is the level of the parameter being added to the model, P1 (avg) is the average level of the parameter being added for all seven addition fuels specified at § 80.49(a), Pj is the level of the other fuel parameter, Pj (avg) is the centering value for the other fuel parameter used to develop the complex model or used in the other parameter's augmentation study, and Ei is as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which are found to satisfy the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Such terms shall be added to the regression model in a stepwise manner.
              (3) The model described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section shall be developed separately for normal-emitting and higher-emitting vehicles. Each emitter class shall be treated as a distinct population for the purposes of determining regression coefficients.
              (4) Once the augmented models described in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section have been developed, they shall be converted to an uncentered form through appropriate algebraic manipulation.
              (5) The augmented model described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall be used to determine the effects of the parameter in question at levels between the levels in Fuels 1 and 3, as defined at § 80.49(a)(1), for all fuels which claim emission benefits from the parameter in question.
              (d)(1) In the case of petitions to augment the complex model defined at § 80.45 by extending the range of an existing complex model parameter, the effect of the parameter being tested shall be determined separately, for each pollutant and for each technology group and emitter class category, at levels between the extension level and the nearest limit of the core of the data used to develop the unaugmented complex model as follows:

              (2) The emission performance of each vehicle on the fuels specified at § 80.49(b)(2), as measured through vehicle testing in accordance with §§ 80.50 through 80.62, shall be analyzed to determine the effects of the fuel parameter being tested on emissions according to the following procedure:
              (i) The analysis shall incorporate the vehicle testing data from the extension fuels specified at § 80.49(b), the vehicle testing results used to develop the model specified at § 80.45, and vehicle testing results used to support any prior augmentation requests which the Administrator deems necessary. A regression incorporating the following terms shall be fitted to the natural logarithm of emissions contained in this combined data set:

              (A) A term for each vehicle that shall reflect the effect of the vehicle on emissions independent of fuel compositions. These terms shall be of the form Di × Vi, where Di is the coefficient for the term and Vi is a dummy variable which shall have the value 1.0 for the ith vehicle and the value 0 for all other vehicles. Vehicles shall be represented by separate terms for each test program in which they were tested. The vehicle terms for the vehicles included in the test program undertaken by the petitioner shall be calculated based on the results from all three fuels specified at § 80.49(b)(2).
              (B) Existing complex model terms that do not include the parameter being extended and their coefficients, including those augmentations that the Administrator deems necessary. The centering values for these terms shall be identical to the centering values used to develop the complex model described at § 80.45.
              (C) Existing complex model terms that include the parameter being extended. The coefficients for these terms shall be estimated by the regression. The centering values for these terms shall be identical to the centering values used to develop the complex model described at § 80.45.
              (D) If the unaugmented VOC or NOX complex models do not contain a squared term for the parameter being extended, such a term should be added in a stepwise fashion after completing the model described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. The coefficient for this term shall be estimated by the regression. The centering value for this term shall be identical to the centering value used to develop the complex model described at § 80.45.
              (E) The terms defined in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(C) and (D) of this section shall be evaluated against the statistical criteria defined in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (ii) The model described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section shall be developed separately for normal-emitting and higher-emitting vehicles, as defined at § 80.62. Each emitter class shall be treated as a distinct population for the purposes of determining regression coefficients.
              (e) Statistical criteria. (1) The petitioner shall be required to submit evidence with the petition which demonstrates the statistical validity of the regression described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, including at minimum:
              (i) Evidence demonstrating that colinearity problems are not severe, including but not limited to variance inflation statistics of less than 10 for the second-order and interactive terms included in the regression model.
              (ii) Evidence demonstrating that the regression residuals are normally distributed, including but not limited to the skewness and Kurtosis statistics for the residuals.

              (iii) Evidence demonstrating that overfitting and underfitting risks have been balanced, including but not limited to the use of Mallow's Cp criterion.
              (2) The petitioner shall be required to submit evidence with the petition which demonstrates that the appropriate terms have been included in the regression, including at minimum:
              (i) Descriptions of the analysis methods used to develop the regressions, including any computer code used to analyze emissions data and the results of regression runs used to develop the proposed augmentation, including intermediate regressions produced during the stepwise regression process.
              (ii) Evidence demonstrating that the significance level used to include terms in the model was equal to 0.90.
              (f) The complex emission model shall be augmented with the results of vehicle testing as follows:

              (1) The terms and coefficients determined in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section shall be used to supplement the complex emission model equation for the corresponding pollutant and emitter category. These terms and coefficients shall be weighted to reflect the contribution of the emitter category to in-use emissions as shown at § 80.45.
              (2) If the candidate parameter is not included in the unaugmented complex model and is not represented in whole or in part by one or more parameters included in the model, the modification shall be accomplished by adding the terms and coefficients to the complex model equation for that pollutant, technology group, and emitter category.
              (3) If the parameter is included in the complex model but is being tested at levels beyond the current range of the model, the terms and coefficients determined in paragraph (d) of this section shall be used to supplement the complex emission model equation for the corresponding pollutant.
              (i) The terms and coefficients of the complex model described at § 80.45 shall be used to evaluate the emissions performance of fuels with levels of the parameter being tested that are within the valid range of the model, as defined at § 80.45.
              (ii) The emissions performance of fuels with levels of the parameter that are beyond the valid range of the unaugmented model shall be given in percentage change terms by 100 − [(100 + A) × (100 + C) / (100 + B)], where:
              (A) “A” shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions for a fuel with identical fuel property values to the fuel being evaluated except for the parameter being extended, which shall be set equal to the nearest limit of the data core, using the unaugmented complex model.
              (B) “B” shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions for the fuel described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section according to the augmented complex model.
              (C) “C” shall be set equal to the percentage change in emissions of the actual fuel being evaluated using the augmented complex model.
              (g) EPA reserves the right to analyze the data generated during vehicle testing, to use such analyses to determine the validity of other augmentation petitions, and to use such data to update the complex model for use in certifying all reformulated gasolines.
              (h) Duration of acceptance of emission effects determined through vehicle testing:
              (1) If the Agency does not accept, modify, or reject a particular augmentation for inclusion in an updated complex model (performed through rulemaking), then the augmentation shall remain in effect until the next update to the complex model takes effect.
              (2) If the Agency does reject or modify a particular augmentation for inclusion in an updated complex model, then the augmentation shall no longer be able to be used as of the date the updated complex model is deemed to take effect, unless the following conditions and limitations apply:
              (i) The augmentation in question may continue to be used by those fuel suppliers which can prove, to the Administrator's satisfaction, that the fuel supplier had already begun producing a fuel utilizing the augmentation at the time the revised model is promulgated.
              (ii) The augmentation in question may only be used to evaluate the emissions performance of fuels in conjunction with the complex emission model in effect as of the date of production of the fuels.
              (iii) The augmentation may only be used for three years of fuel production, or a total of five years from the date the augmentation first took effect, whichever is shorter.
              (3) The Administrator shall determine when sufficient new information on the effects of fuel properties on vehicle emissions has been obtained to warrant development of an updated complex model.

              (i) For the purposes of vehicle testing, the “baseline” level of the parameter shall refer to the level of the parameter in Clean Air Act baseline gasoline. The “candidate” level of the parameter shall refer to the most extreme value of the parameter, relative to baseline levels, for which the augmentation shall be valid.
              (ii) If the fuel parameter for which the fuel supplier is petitioning EPA to augment the complex emission model (hereinafter defined as the “candidate parameter”) is not specified for Clean Air Act summer baseline fuel, then the baseline level for the candidate parameter shall be set at the levels found in typical gasoline. This level and the justification for this level shall be included in the petitioner's submittal to EPA prior to initiating the test program, and EPA must approve this level prior to the start of the program.
              (iii) If the candidate parameter is not specified for Clean Air Act summer baseline fuel, and is not present in typical gasoline, its baseline level shall be zero.
              (2) The addition fuels shall contain detergent control additives in accordance with section 211(l) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the associated EPA requirements for such additives.
              (3) The addition fuels shall be specified with at least the same level of detail and precision as in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, and this information shall be included in the petition submitted to the Administrator requesting augmentation of the complex emission model.
              (i) Paraffin levels in Fuels 1 and 2 shall be altered from the paraffin level in Fuel 3 to compensate for the addition or removal of the candidate parameter, if necessary. Paraffin levels in Fuel 4 shall be altered from the paraffin level in Fuel 5 to compensate for the addition or removal of the candidate parameter, if necessary. Paraffin levels in Fuel 6 shall be altered from the paraffin level in Fuel 7 to compensate for the addition or removal of the candidate parameter, if necessary.

              (ii) Other properties of Fuels 4 and 6 shall not vary from the levels for Fuels 5 and 7, respectively, unless such variations are the naturally-occurring result of the changes described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. Other properties of Fuels 1 and 2 shall not vary from the levels for Fuel 3, unless such variations are the naturally- occurring result of the changes described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
              
              (iii) The addition fuels shall be specified with at least the same level of detail and precision as defined in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, and this information must be included in the petition submitted to the Administrator requesting augmentation of the complex emission model.
              (4) The properties of the addition fuels shall be within the blending tolerances defined in this paragraph (a)(4) relative to the values specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. Fuels that do not meet these tolerances shall require the approval of the Administrator to be used in vehicle testing to augment the complex emission model:

              (v) The complex emission model described at § 80.45 shall be used to adjust the emission performance of the addition and extension fuels to compensate for differences in fuel compositions that are incorporated in the complex model, as described at § 80.48. Compensating adjustments for naturally-resulting variations in fuel parameters shall also be made using the complex model. The adjustment process is described in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) The complex emission model described at § 80.45 shall be used to adjust the emission performance of addition and extension fuels to compensate for differences in fuel parameters other than the parameter being tested. Compensating adjustments for naturally-resulting variations in fuel parameters shall also be made using the complex model. These adjustments shall be calculated as follows:
              (1) Determine the exhaust emissions performance of the actual addition or extension fuels relative to the exhaust emissions performance of Clean Air Act baseline fuel using the complex model. For addition fuels, set the level of the parameter being tested at baseline levels for purposes of emissions performance evaluation using the complex model. For extension fuel #1, set the level of the parameter being extended at the level specified in extension fuel #2. Also determine the exhaust emissions performance of the addition fuels specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section with the level of the parameter being tested set at baseline levels.
              (2) Calculate adjustment factors for each addition fuel as follows:
              (i) Adjustment factors shall be calculated using the formula:
              
                ER16FE94.006
              
              
                where
                
                A = the adjustment factor
                P(actual) = the performance of the actual fuel used in testing according to the complex model
                P(nominal) = the performance that would have been achieved by the test fuel defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section according to the complex model (as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section).
              
              
              (ii) Adjustment factors shall be calculated for each pollutant and for each emitter class.
              (3) Multiply the measured emissions from each vehicle by the corresponding adjustment factor for the appropriate addition or extension fuel, pollutant, and emitter class. Use the resulting adjusted emissions to conduct all modeling and emission effect estimation activities described in § 80.48.
              (e) All fuels included in vehicle testing programs shall have an octane number of 87.5, as measured by the (R + M)/2 method following the ASTM D4814 procedures, to within the measurement and blending tolerances specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (f) A single batch of each addition or extension fuel shall be used throughout the duration of the testing program.

              General test procedure requirements for augmentation of the emission models.
              (a) The following test procedure must be followed when testing to augment the complex emission model described at § 80.45.
              (1) VOC, NOX, CO, and CO2 emissions must be measured for all fuel-vehicle combinations tested.

              (2) Toxics emissions must be measured when testing the extension fuels per the requirements of § 80.49(b) or when testing addition fuels 1, 2, or 3 per the requirements of § 80.49(a).
              
              (3) When testing addition fuels 4, 5, 6, and 7 per the requirements of § 80.49(a), toxics emissions need not be measured. However, EPA reserves the right to require the inclusion of such measurements in the test program prior to approval of the test program if evidence exists which suggests that adverse interactive effects of the parameter in question may exist for toxics emissions.
              (b) The general requirements per 40 CFR 86.130-96 shall be met.
              (c) The engine starting and restarting procedures per 40 CFR 86.136-90 shall be followed.
              (d) Except as provided for at § 80.59, general preparation of vehicles being tested shall follow procedures detailed in 40 CFR 86.130-96 and 86.131-96.

              (a) Initial vehicle preconditioning and preconditioning between tests with different fuels shall be performed in accordance with the “General vehicle handling requirements” per 40 CFR 86.132-96, up to and including the completion of the hot start exhaust test.
              (b) The preconditioning procedure prescribed at 40 CFR 86.132-96 shall be observed for preconditioning vehicles between tests using the same fuel.

              § 80.55
              Measurement methods for benzene and 1,3-butadiene.
              (a) Sampling for benzene and 1,3-butadiene must be accomplished by bag sampling as used for total hydrocarbons determination. This procedure is detailed in 40 CFR 86.109.
              (b) Benzene and 1,3-butadiene must be analyzed by gas chromatography. Expected values for benzene and 1,3-butadiene in bag samples for the baseline fuel are 4.0 ppm and 0.30 ppm respectively. At least three standards ranging from at minimum 50% to 150% of these expected values must be used to calibrate the detector. An additional standard of at most 0.01 ppm must also be measured to determine the required limit of quantification as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (c) The sample injection size used in the chromatograph must be sufficient to be above the laboratory determined limit of quantification (LOQ) as defined in paragraph (d) of this section for at least one of the bag samples. A control chart of the measurements of the standards used to determine the response, repeatability, and limit of quantitation of the instrumental method for 1,3-butadiene and benzene must be reported.

              (d) As in all types of sampling and analysis procedures, good laboratory practices must be used. See, Lawrence, Principals of Environmental Analysis, 55 Analytical Chemistry 14, at 2210-2218 (1983) (copies may be obtained from the publisher, American Chemical Society, 1155 16th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036). Reporting reproducibility control charts and limits of detection measurements are integral procedures to assess the validity of the chosen analytical method. The repeatability of the test method must be determined by measuring a standard periodically during testing and recording the measured values on a control chart. The control chart shows the error between the measured standard and the prepared standard concentration for the periodic testing. The error between the measured standard and the actual standard indicates the uncertainty in the analysis. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined by repeatedly measuring a blank and a standard prepared at a concentration near an assumed value of the limit of detection. If the average concentration minus the average of the blanks is greater than three standard deviations of these measurements, then the limit of detection is at least as low as the prepared standard. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) is defined as ten times the standard deviation of these measurements. This quantity defines the amount of sample required to be measured for a valid analysis.
              (e) Other sampling and analytical techniques will be allowed if they can be proven to have equal specificity and equal or better limits of quantitation. Data from alternative methods that can be demonstrated to have equivalent or superior limits of detection, precision, and accuracy may be accepted by the Administrator with individual prior approval.
            
            
              § 80.56
              Measurement methods for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.
              (a) Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde will be measured by drawing exhaust samples from heated lines through either 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) impregnated cartridges or impingers filled with solutions of DNPH in acetonitrile (ACN) as described in §§ 86.109 and 86.140 of this chapter for formaldehyde analysis. Diluted exhaust sample volumes must be at least 15 L for impingers containing 20 ml of absorbing solution (using more absorbing solution in the impinger requires proportionally more gas sample to be taken) and at least 4 L for cartridges. As required in § 86.109 of this chapter, two impingers or cartridges must be connected in series to detect breakthrough of the first impinger or cartridge.
              (b) In addition, sufficient sample must be drawn through the collecting cartridges or impingers so that the measured quantity of aldehyde is sufficiently greater than the minimum limit of quantitation of the test method for at least a portion of the exhaust test procedure. The limit of quantitation is determined using the technique defined in § 80.55(d).
              (c) Each of the impinger samples are quantitatively transferred to a 25 mL volumetric flask (5 mL more than the sample impinger volume) and brought to volume with ACN. The cartridge samples are eluted in reversed direction by gravity feed with 6mL of ACN. The eluate is collected in a graduated test tube and made up to the 5mL mark with ACN. Both the impinger and cartridge samples must be analyzed by HPLC without additional sample preparation.
              (d) The analysis of the aldehyde derivatives collected is accomplished with a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). Standards consisting of the hydrazone derivative of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are used to determine the response, repeatability, and limit of quantitation of the HPLC method chosen for acetaldehyde and formaldehyde.
              (e) Other sampling and analytical techniques will be allowed if they can be proven to have equal specificity and equal or better limits of quantitation. Data from alternative methods that can be demonstrated to have equivalent or superior limits of detection, precision, and accuracy may be accepted by the Administrator with individual prior approval.

              General test fleet requirements for vehicle testing.
              (a) The test fleet must consist of only 1989-91 MY vehicles which are technologically equivalent to 1990 MY vehicles, or of 1986-88 MY vehicles for which no changes to the engine or exhaust system that would significantly affect emissions have been made through the 1990 model year. To be technologically equivalent vehicles at minimum must have closed-loop systems and possess adaptive learning.
              (b) No maintenance or replacement of any vehicle component is permitted except when necessary to ensure operator safety or as specifically permitted in § 80.60 and § 80.61. All vehicle maintenance procedures must be reported to the Administrator.
              (c) Each vehicle in the test fleet shall have no fewer than 4,000 miles of accumulated mileage prior to being included in the test program.

              § 80.60
              Test fleet requirements for exhaust emission testing.
              (a) Candidate vehicles which conform to the emission performance requirements defined in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section shall be obtained directly from the in-use fleet and tested in their as-received condition.
              (b) Candidate vehicles for the test fleet must be screened for their exhaust VOC emissions in accordance with the provisions in § 80.62.
              (c) On the basis of pretesting pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the test fleet shall be subdivided into two emitter group sub-fleets: the normal emitter group and the higher emitter group.
              (1) Each vehicle with an exhaust total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions rate which is less than or equal to twice the applicable emissions standard shall be placed in the normal emitter group.
              (2) Each vehicle with an exhaust THC emissions rate which is greater than two times the applicable emissions standard shall be placed in the higher emitter group.
              (d) The test vehicles in each emitter group must conform to the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section.
              (1) Test vehicles for the normal emitter sub-fleet must be selected from the list shown in this paragraph (d)(1). This list is arranged in order of descending vehicle priority, such that the order in which vehicles are added to the normal emitter sub-fleet must conform to the order shown (e.g., a ten-vehicle normal emitter group sub-fleet must consist of the first ten vehicles listed in this paragraph (d)(1)). If more vehicles are tested than the minimum number of vehicles required for the normal emitter sub-fleet, additional vehicles are to be added to the fleet in the order specified in this paragraph (d)(1), beginning with the next vehicle not already included in the group. The vehicles in the normal emitter sub-fleet must possess the characteristics indicated in the list. If the end of the list is reached in adding vehicles to the normal emitter sub-fleet and additional vehicles are desired then they shall be added beginning with vehicle number one, and must be added to the normal emitter sub-fleet in accordance with the order in table A:

              (c) Standards must be met on either a per-gallon or on an average basis. (1) Any refiner or importer, for each batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB it produces or imports, shall meet:
              (i) Those standards and requirements it designated under paragraph (d) of this section for per-gallon compliance on a per-gallon basis; and
              (ii) Those standards and requirements it designated under paragraph (d) of this section for average compliance on an average basis over the applicable averaging period.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (3)(i) For each averaging period, and separately for each parameter that may be met either per-gallon or on average, any refiner shall designate for each refinery, or any importer shall designate its gasoline or RBOB as being subject to the standard applicable to that parameter on either a per-gallon or average basis. For any specific averaging period and parameter all batches of gasoline or RBOB shall be designated as being subject to the per-gallon standard, or all batches of gasoline and RBOB shall be designated as being subject to the average standard. For any specific averaging period and parameter a refiner for a refinery, or any importer may not designate certain batches as being subject to the per-gallon standard and others as being subject to the average standard.

              (ii) In the event any refiner for a refinery, or any importer fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section and for a specific averaging period and parameter designates certain batches as being subject to the per-gallon standard and others as being subject to the average, all batches produced or imported during the averaging period that were designated as being subject to the average standard shall, ab initio, be redesignated as being subject to the per-gallon standard. This redesignation shall apply regardless of whether the batches in question met or failed to meet the per-gallon standard for the parameter in question.
              (d) Designation of gasoline. Any refiner or importer of gasoline shall designate the gasoline it produces or imports as follows:
              (1) All gasoline produced or imported shall be properly designated as reformulated gasoline, conventional gasoline, RBOB, or CBOB.
              (2) All gasoline designated as reformulated or as RBOB shall be further properly designated as:
              (i) Either VOC-controlled or not VOC-controlled;
              (ii) In the case of gasoline or RBOB designated as VOC-controlled:
              (A) Either intended for use in VOC-Control Region 1 or VOC-Control Region 2 (as defined in § 80.71); or
              (B) Designated as “adjusted VOC gasoline” (as defined in § 80.40(c)(1));
              (iii)-(iv) [Reserved]
              (v) For each of the following parameters, either gasoline or RBOB which meets the standard applicable to that parameter on a per-gallon basis or on average—
              (A) Toxics emissions performance;
              (B) NOX emissions performance in the case of gasoline certified using the complex model.
              (C) Benzene content; and
              (D) In the case of VOC-controlled gasoline or RBOB certified using the complex model, VOC emissions performance; and
              (vi) In the case of RBOB, the gasoline must be designated as RBOB and the designation must include the type(s) and amount(s) of oxygenate required to be blended with the RBOB.
              (3) Every batch of reformulated gasoline, conventional gasoline, RBOB, or CBOB produced or imported at each refinery or import facility shall be assigned a number (the “batch number”), consisting of the EPA-assigned refiner or importer registration number, the EPA facility registration number, the last two digits of the year in which the batch was produced, and a unique number for the batch, beginning with the number one for the first batch produced or imported each calendar year and each subsequent batch during the calendar year being assigned the next sequential number (e.g., 4321-54321-95-000001, 4321-54321-95-000002, etc.).
              (e) Determination of volume and properties. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(3) and (4) of this section, each refiner or importer shall, for each batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB produced or imported, determine the volume and the value of each of the properties specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, except that the value for RVP must be determined only in the case of reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is VOC-controlled. These determinations shall—
              (i) Be based on a representative sample of the reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is analyzed using the methodologies specified in § 80.46 through December 31, 2015, or, beginning January 1, 2016, in either § 80.46 or § 80.47;
              (ii) In the case of RBOB, follow the oxygenate blending instructions specified in § 80.69(a);
              (iii) Be carried out either by the refiner or importer, or by an independent laboratory; and
              (iv) Be completed prior to the gasoline or RBOB leaving the refinery or import facility for each parameter that the gasoline or RBOB is subject to, or that is used to calculate an emissions performance that the gasoline or RBOB is subject to, under § 80.41(a) through (f).
              (2) In the event that the value of any of these properties is determined by the refiner or importer and by an independent laboratory in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section—
              (i) The results of the analyses conducted by the refiner or importer for such properties shall be used as the basis for compliance determinations unless the absolute value of the differences of the test results from the two laboratories is larger than the following values:

              (ii) In the event the values from the two laboratories for any property fall outside these ranges, the refiner or importer shall use as the basis for compliance determinations:
              (A) The larger of the two values for the property, except the smaller of the two results shall be used for oxygenates; or
              (B) The refiner or importer shall have the gasoline analyzed for the property at one additional independent laboratory. If this second independent laboratory obtains a result for the property that is within the range, as listed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, of the refiner's or importer's result for this property, then the refiner's or importer's result shall be used as the basis for compliance determinations.
              (3) Beginning January 1, 2013, API Gravity is not required to be measured or reported for the purpose of batch certification.
              (4) For the purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph (e) for any winter fuel parameter except benzene, oxygenate, RVP and sulfur, any refiner or importer may, prior to analysis, combine samples of gasoline collected from more than one batch of gasoline or blendstock (“composite sample”), and treat such composite sample as one batch of gasoline or blendstock provided that the refiner or importer meets all the following requirements:
              (i) Samples must be from a single reporting year, must be limited to non-VOC gasoline, and must be of a single grade of gasoline or of a single type of batch-produced blendstock.
              (ii) Combines samples of gasoline that are produced or imported over a period no longer than one month. Blendstock samples of a single blendstock type obtained from continuous processes over a calendar month may be mixed together to form one blendstock sample and the sample subsequently analyzed for the required fuel parameters.
              (iii)(A) Samples shall have been collected and stored using good laboratory practices in order to prevent change in product composition with regard to baseline properties and to minimize loss of volatile fractions of the sample.

              (B) Properties of the retained samples shall be adjusted for loss of butane or pentane by comparing the RVP measured immediately after blending with the RVP determined at the time that the supplemental properties are measured.
              (C) The volume of each batch or shipment sampled, to the nearest gallon, shall have been noted and the sum of the volumes, in gallons, calculated.
              (iv) For each batch or shipment sampled, the ratio of its volume to the total volume determined in paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(C) of this section shall be determined to three decimal places. This shall be the volumetric fraction of the shipment in the mixture.
              (v) The total minimum volume required to perform duplicate analyses to obtain values of all of the required fuel parameters shall be determined.
              (vi) The volumetric fraction determined in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section for each batch or shipment shall be multiplied by the value determined in paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section.
              (vii) The resulting value determined in paragraph (e)(4)(vi) of this section for each batch or shipment shall be the volume of each batch or shipment's sample to be added to the mixture. This volume shall be determined to the nearest milliliter.
              (viii) The appropriate volumes of each shipment's sample shall be thoroughly mixed and the solution analyzed per the methods required under § 80.46 or § 80.47, as applicable.
              (ix) Uses the total of the volumes of the batches of gasoline that comprise the composite sample, and the results of the analyses of the composite sample, for purposes of compliance calculations under this paragraph (e).
              (f) Independent analysis requirement. (1) Any refiner or importer of reformulated gasoline or RBOB shall carry out a program of independent sample collection and analyses for the reformulated gasoline it produces or imports, which meets the requirements of one of the following two options:
              (i) Option 1. The refiner or importer shall, for each batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is produced or imported, have the value for each property specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section determined by an independent laboratory that collects and analyzes a representative sample from the batch using the methodologies specified in § 80.46 through December 31, 2015, and the methodologies specified in § 80.47 beginning January 1, 2016.
              (ii) Option 2. The refiner or importer shall have a periodic independent testing program carried out for all reformulated gasoline produced or imported, which shall consist of the following:

              (B) EPA will identify up to ten percent of the total number of samples collected under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; and
              (C) The designated independent laboratory shall, for each sample identified by EPA under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, determine the value for each property using the methodologies specified in § 80.46.
              (2)(i) Any refiner or importer shall designate one independent laboratory for each refinery or import facility at which reformulated gasoline or RBOB is produced or imported. This independent laboratory will collect samples and perform analyses in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (f) of this section.
              (ii) Any refiner or importer shall identify this designated independent laboratory to EPA under the registration requirements of § 80.76.
              (iii) In order to be considered independent:

              (ii) The alternate laboratory is used only when the designated independent laboratory per paragraph (f)(2) of this section is unavailable and cannot perform testing required for compliance, for example, when the primary designated laboratory is closed, the apparatus for certain test methods are down, or independent laboratory personnel are not available.
              (iii) The alternate independent laboratory is not used to select a preferred test result.
              (g) [Reserved]
              (h) Compliance audits. Any refiner and importer of any reformulated gasoline or RBOB shall have the reformulated gasoline and RBOB it produced or imported during each calendar year audited for compliance with the requirements of this subpart D, in accordance with the requirements of subpart F, at the conclusion of each calendar year.
              (i) Exclusion of previously certified gasoline. Any refiner who uses previously certified reformulated gasoline, conventional gasoline, RBOB, or CBOB to produce reformulated gasoline or RBOB must exclude the previously certified gasoline for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the standards under § 80.41. This exclusion must be accomplished by the refiner as follows:
              (1)(i) Determine the volume and properties of each batch of previously certified gasoline used to produce reformulated gasoline or RBOB using the procedures in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and § 80.66, and the independent analysis requirements in paragraph (f) of this section in the case of previously certified reformulated gasoline.

              (ii) In the case of previously certified reformulated gasoline or RBOB determine the emissions performances for toxics and NOX, except as provided in § 80.41(e) and (f), and VOC for VOC-controlled gasoline, and the designations for VOC control.

              (iii) In the case of previously certified conventional gasoline or CBOB, determine the exhaust toxics and NOX emissions performances, except as provided in § 80.101(c)(3) and (4).

              (2) Determine the volume and properties, and the emissions performance for toxics and NOX, and VOC for VOC-controlled gasoline, of any batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB produced at the refinery using previously certified gasoline and include each batch in the refinery's compliance calculations without regard to the presence of previously certified gasoline in the batch.
              (3) In the case of any parameter or emissions performance standard that the refiner has designated for the refinery to meet on a per-gallon basis under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, the per-gallon standard that applies to any batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB produced by the refinery is as follows:
              (i) When using any previously certified reformulated gasoline or RBOB, the more stringent of:
              (A) The per-gallon standard that applies to the refinery under § 80.41; or
              (B) The most stringent value for that parameter or emissions performance for any previously certified reformulated gasoline or RBOB used to produce the batch.
              (ii) When using any previously certified conventional gasoline, the per-gallon standard that applies to the refinery under § 80.41.
              (4) In the case of any parameter or emissions performance standard that the refiner has designated for the refinery to meet on average under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, any previously certified gasoline must be excluded from the refinery's compliance calculations as follows:
              (i) Where a refiner uses previously certified reformulated gasoline or RBOB to produce reformulated gasoline or RBOB:

              (A) The refiner must include the volume and properties of any batch of previously certified reformulated gasoline or RBOB in the refinery's compliance calculations for the standard under § 80.67(g) as a negative batch, by multiplying the term Vi in § 80.67(g)(1)(ii) (i.e., the batch volume) times negative 1; and
              (B) The negative batch under paragraph (i)(4)(i)(A) of this section must be included in the averaging categories that correspond to the designation regarding VOC control of the previously certified gasoline batch when received; and
              (C) The net volume of gasoline in the refinery's reformulated gasoline compliance calculations must be positive in each of the following categories where the standard is being met on average:

              (ii) Where a refiner uses previously certified conventional gasoline or CBOB to produce reformulated gasoline or RBOB—
              (A) The refiner must include the volume and properties of any batch of previously certified conventional gasoline or CBOB as a negative batch in the refiner's anti-dumping compliance calculations under § 80.101(g) for the refinery, or where applicable, the refiner's aggregation under § 80.101(h); and
              (B) The net volume of gasoline in the refiner's anti-dumping compliance calculations for the refinery, or, where applicable, the refiner's aggregation under § 80.101(h), must be positive.

              (5) The refiner must use any previously certified gasoline that the refiner includes as a negative batch under paragraph (i)(4) of this section in its compliance calculations for the refinery, or where appropriate, the refiner's aggregation, as a component in gasoline production during the annual averaging period in which the previously certified gasoline was included as a negative batch in the refiner's compliance calculations.
              (6)
              (6)(i) Any refiner may use the procedures specified in this paragraph (i) to combine previously certified conventional gasoline or CBOB with reformulated gasoline or RBOB, to reclassify conventional gasoline or CBOB into reformulated gasoline or RBOB, or to change the designations of reformulated gasoline or RBOB with regard to VOC control.
              (ii) The procedures under this section are refinery procedures. Any person who uses the procedures under this section is a refiner who must meet all requirements applicable to refiners under this subpart.
              (7) Nothing in this paragraph (i) prevents any party from combining previously certified reformulated gasolines from different sources in a manner that does not violate the prohibitions in § 80.78(a).

              § 80.66
              Calculation of reformulated gasoline properties.
              (a) All volume measurements required by these regulations shall be temperature adjusted to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
              (b) The percentage of oxygen by weight contained in a gasoline blend, based upon its percentage oxygenate by volume and density, shall exclude denaturants and water.

              (c) The properties of reformulated gasoline consist of per-gallon values separately and individually determined on a batch-by-batch basis using the methodologies specified in § 80.46 for each of those physical and chemical parameters necessary to determine compliance with the standards to which the gasoline is subject, and per-gallon values for the VOC, NOX, and toxics emissions performance standards to which the gasoline is subject.
              (d) Per-gallon oxygen content shall be determined based upon the weight percent oxygen of a representative sample of gasoline, using the method set forth in § 80.46(g). The total oxygen content associated with a batch of gasoline (in percent-gallons) is calculated by multiplying the weight percent oxygen content times the volume.
              (e) Per-gallon benzene content shall be determined based upon the volume percent benzene of a representative sample of a batch of gasoline by the method set forth in § 80.46(e). The total benzene content associated with a batch of gasoline (in percent-gallons) is calculated by multiplying the volume percent benzene content times the volume.
              (f) Per-gallon RVP shall be determined based upon the measurement of RVP of a representative sample of a batch of gasoline. The total RVP value associated with a batch of gasoline (in RVP-gallons) is calculated by multiplying the RVP times the volume.
              (g)(1) Per gallon values for VOC and NOX emissions reduction shall be calculated using the methodology specified in § 80.45 that is appropriate for the gasoline.
              (2) Per-gallon values for toxic emissions performance reduction shall be established using:
              (i) For gasoline subject to the simple model, the methodology under § 80.42 that is appropriate for the gasoline; and
              (ii) For gasoline subject to the complex model, the methodology specified in § 80.45 that is appropriate for the gasoline.
              (3) The total VOC, NOX, and toxic emissions performance reduction values associated with a batch of gasoline (in percent reduction-gallons) is calculated by multiplying the per-gallon percent emissions performance reduction times the volume of the batch.

              § 80.67
              Compliance on average.

              The requirements of this section apply to all reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced or imported for which compliance with one or more of the requirements of § 80.41 is determined on average (“averaged gasoline”).
              
              (a) Compliance survey required in order to meet standards on average. (1) Any refiner or importer that complies with the compliance survey requirements of § 80.68 has the option of meeting the standards specified in § 80.41 for average compliance in addition to the option of meeting the standards specified in § 80.41 for per-gallon compliance; any refiner or importer that does not comply with the survey requirements must meet the standards specified in § 80.41 for per-gallon compliance, and does not have the option of meeting standards on average.
              (2)(i)(A) A refiner or importer that produces or imports reformulated gasoline that exceeds the average standard for benzene (but not for other parameters that have average standards) may use such gasoline to offset reformulated gasoline which does not achieve this average standard, but only if the reformulated gasoline that does not achieve this average standard is sold to ultimate consumers in the same covered area as was the reformulated gasoline which exceeds the average standard; provided that:
              (B) Prior to the beginning of the averaging period when the averaging approach described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section is used, the refiner or importer obtains approval from EPA. In order to seek such approval, the refiner or importer shall submit a petition to EPA, such petition to include:
              (1) The identification of the refiner and refinery, or importer, the covered area, and the averaging period; and
              (2) A detailed description of the procedures the refiner or importer will use to ensure the gasoline is produced by the refiner or is imported by the importer and is used only in the covered area in question and is not used in any other covered area, and the record keeping, reporting, auditing, and other quality assurance measures that will be followed to establish the gasoline is used as intended; and
              (C) The refiner or importer properly completes any requirements that are specified by EPA as conditions for approval of the petition.
              (ii) Any refiner or importer that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section will be deemed to have satisfied the compliance survey requirements of § 80.68 for the covered area in question.
              (b) Scope of averaging. (1) Any refiner shall meet all applicable averaged standards separately for each of the refiner's refineries;
              (2)(i) Any importer shall meet all applicable averaged standards on the basis of all averaged reformulated gasoline and RBOB imported by the importer; except that
              (ii) Any importer to whom different standards apply for gasoline imported at different facilities by operation of § 80.41(i), shall meet the averaged standards separately for the averaged reformulated gasoline and RBOB imported into each group of facilities that is subject to the same standards; and
              (3) [Reserved]
              (c) RVP and VOC emissions performance reduction compliance on average. (1) The VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced at any refinery or imported by any importer during the period January 1 through September 15 of each calendar year which is designated for average compliance for RVP or VOC emissions performance on average must meet the standards for RVP (in the case of a refinery or importer subject to the simple model standards) or the standards for VOC emissions performance reduction (in the case of a refinery or importer subject to the complex model standards) which are applicable to that refinery or importer as follows:
              (i) Gasoline and RBOB designated for VOC Control Region 1 must meet the standards for that Region which are applicable to that refinery or importer; and
              (ii) Gasoline and RBOB designated for VOC Control Region 2 must meet the standards for that Region which are applicable to that refinery or importer.
              (2) In the case of a refinery or importer subject to the simple model standards, each gallon of reformulated gasoline and RBOB designated as being VOC-controlled may not exceed the maximum standards for RVP specified in § 80.41(b) which are applicable to that refiner or importer.

              (3) In the case of a refinery or importer subject to the complex model standards, each gallon of reformulated gasoline designated as being VOC-controlled must equal or exceed the minimum standards for VOC emissions performance specified in § 80.41 which are applicable to that refinery or importer.
              (d) Toxics emissions reduction and benzene compliance on average. (1) The averaging period for the requirements for benzene content and toxics emission performance is January 1 through December 31 of each year.
              (2) The reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced at any refinery or imported by any importer during the toxics emissions performance and benzene averaging periods that is designated for average compliance for these parameters shall on average meet the standards specified for toxics emissions performance and benzene in § 80.41 which are applicable to that refinery or importer.
              (3) Each gallon of reformulated gasoline may not exceed the maximum standard for benzene content specified in § 80.41 which is applicable to that refinery or importer.
              (e) NO
                X
                compliance on average. (1) The averaging period for NOX emissions performance is January 1 through December 31 of each year.
              (2) The requirements of this paragraph (e) apply separately to reformulated gasoline and RBOB in the following categories:
              (i) All reformulated gasoline and RBOB that is designated as VOC-controlled; and
              (ii) All reformulated gasoline and RBOB that is not designated as VOC-controlled.

              (3) The reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced at any refinery or imported by any importer during the NOX averaging period that is designated for average compliance for NOX shall on average meet the standards for NOX specified in § 80.41 that are applicable to that refinery or importer.
              (f) [Reserved]
              (g) Compliance calculation. To determine compliance with the averaged standards in § 80.41, any refiner for each of its refineries at which averaged reformulated gasoline or RBOB is produced, and any importer that imports averaged reformulated gasoline or RBOB shall, for each averaging period and for each portion of gasoline for which standards must be separately achieved, and for each relevant standard, calculate:
              (1)(i)(A) The compliance total using the following formula:
              
                ER17JY01.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                Vi = the volume in gallons of gasoline batch i.
                std = the standard for the parameter being evaluated.
                n = the number of batches of gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period.
              
              
              (B) For computation of the VOC performance standard compliance total, Std for each VOC control region is determined by the following formula:
              
                ER17JY01.001
              
              
                Where, for gasoline and RBOB designated for that VOC control region:
                
                Std = the value to be used in the compliance total formula.
                Stdu = the averaged VOC emissions performance reduction standard applicable to reformulated gasoline and RBOB not designated for compliance with the adjusted VOC gasoline standard.
                Stda = the averaged VOC emissions performance reduction standard applicable to reformulated gasoline and RBOB designated for compliance with the adjusted VOC gasoline standard.
                VUi = the volume of batch i not designated for compliance with the adjusted VOC gasoline standard.
                VAi = the volume of batch i designated for compliance with the adjusted VOC gasoline standard.
                nu = the number of batches produced or imported and not designated for compliance with the adjusted VOC gasoline standard.
                na = the number of batches produced or imported and designated for compliance with the adjusted VOC gasoline standard.
              
              
              (C) The actual total using the following formula:
              
                
                ER17JY01.002
              
              
                Where:
                
                Vi = the volume in gallons of gasoline batch i.
                parmi = the parameter value of gasoline batch i.
                n = the number of batches of gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period.
              
              
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (2) For each standard, compare the actual total with the compliance total.
              (3) For the VOC, NOX, and toxics emissions performance standards, the actual totals must be equal to or greater than the compliance totals to achieve compliance.
              (4) For RVP and benzene standards, the actual total must be equal to or less than the compliance totals to achieve compliance.
              (5) If the actual total for the benzene standard is greater than the compliance total, credits for this parameter must be obtained from another refiner or importer in order to achieve compliance:
              (i) [Reserved]
              (ii) The total number of benzene credits required to achieve compliance is calculated by subtracting the compliance total from the actual total benzene.
              (6) If the actual total for the benzene standard is less than the compliance totals, credits for this parameter are generated.
              (i) [Reserved]
              (ii) The total number of benzene credits which may be traded to another refinery or importer is calculated by subtracting the actual total from the compliance total for benzene.
              (7) In 2006 only, compliance with the oxygen standards in § 80.41 may be based on the volume and oxygen content of all reformulated gasoline produced or imported during the period January 1, 2006, through May 5, 2006 or the volume and oxygen content of all oxygenated reformulated gasoline produced or imported during the 2006 annual averaging period (January 1 through December 31).
              (h) Credit transfers. (1) Compliance with the averaged standards specified in § 80.41 for benzene (but for no other standards or requirements) may be achieved through the transfer of benzene credits provided that:
              (i) The credits were generated in the same averaging period as they are used;
              (ii) The credit transfer takes place no later than fifteen working days following the end of the averaging period in which the reformulated gasoline credits were generated;
              (iii) The credits are properly created;
              (iv) The credits are transferred, either through inter-company or intra-company transfers, directly from the refiner or importer that creates the credits to the refiner or importer that uses the credits to achieve compliance; and
              (v) Benzene credits are not used to achieve compliance with the maximum benzene content standards in § 80.41.
              (2) No party may transfer any credits to the extent such a transfer would result in the transferor having a negative credit balance at the conclusion of the averaging period for which the credits were transferred. Any credits transferred in violation of this paragraph are improperly created credits.
              (3) In the case of credits that were improperly created, the following provisions apply:
              (i) Improperly created credits may not be used to achieve compliance, regardless of a credit transferee's good faith belief that it was receiving valid credits;
              (ii) No refiner or importer may create, report, or transfer improperly created credits; and
              (iii) Where any credit transferor has in its balance at the conclusion of any averaging period both credits which were properly created and credits which were improperly created, the properly created credits will be applied first to any credit transfers before the transferor may apply any credits to achieve its own compliance.
              (i) Average compliance for reformulated gasoline produced or imported before January 1, 1995. In the case of any reformulated gasoline that is intended to be used beginning January 1, 1995, but that is produced or imported prior to that date:
              
              (1) Any refiner or importer may meet standards specified in § 80.41 for average compliance for such gasoline, provided the refiner or importer has the option of meeting standards on average for 1995 under paragraph (a) of this section, and provided the refiner or importer elects to be subject to average standards under § 80.65(c)(3); and
              (2) Any average compliance gasoline under paragraph (i)(1) of this section shall be combined with average compliance gasoline produced during 1995 for purposes of compliance calculations under paragraph (g) of this section.

              (b) Compliance survey option 1. In order to satisfy the compliance survey requirements, any refiner or importer shall properly conduct a program of compliance surveys in accordance with a survey program plan which has been approved by the Administrator of EPA in each covered area which is supplied with any gasoline for which compliance is achieved on average that is produced by that refinery or imported by that importer. Such approval shall be based upon the survey program plan meeting the following criteria:
              (1) The survey program shall consist of at least four surveys which shall occur during the following time periods: one survey during the period January 1 through May 31; two surveys during the period June 1 through September 15; and one survey during the period September 16 through December 31.
              (2) The survey program shall meet the criteria stated in paragraph (d) of this section.

              (3) In the event that any refiner or importer fails to properly carry out an approved survey program, the refiner or importer shall achieve compliance with all applicable standards on a per-gallon basis for the calendar year in which the failure occurs, and may not achieve compliance with any standard on an average basis during this calendar year. This requirement to achieve compliance per-gallon shall apply ab initio to the beginning of any calendar year in which the failure occurs, regardless of when during the year the failure occurs.
              (c) Compliance survey option 2. A refiner or importer shall be deemed to have satisfied the compliance survey requirements described in paragraph (b) of this section if a comprehensive program of surveys is properly conducted in accordance with a survey program plan which has been approved by the Administrator of EPA. Such approval shall be based upon the survey program plan meeting the following criteria:
              (1) The initial schedule for the conduct of surveys shall be as follows:

              (1) A geographic description of each opt-in area, or portion of each opt-in area, which is covered by the petition;
              (2) A description of all ways in which reformulated gasoline is relied upon as a control measure in any approved State or local implementation plan or plan revision, or in any submission to the Agency containing any proposed plan or plan revision (and any associated request for redesignation) that is pending before the Agency when the petition is submitted; and
              (3) For any opt-in areas covered by the petition for which reformulated gasoline is relied upon as a control measure as described under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the petition shall include the following information:
              (i) Identify whether the State is withdrawing any such pending plan submission;
              (ii)(A) Identify whether the State intends to submit a revision to any such approved plan provision or pending plan submission that does not rely on reformulated gasoline as a control measure, and describe the alternative air quality measures, if any, that the State plans to use to replace reformulated gasoline as a control measure;
              (B) A description of the current status of any proposed revision to any such approved plan provision or pending plan submission, as well as a projected schedule for submission of such proposed revision;

              Inability to produce conforming gasoline in extraordinary circumstances.
              In appropriate extreme and unusual circumstances (e.g., natural disaster or Act of God) which are clearly outside the control of the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender and which could not have been avoided by the exercise of prudence, diligence, and due care, EPA may permit a refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender, for a brief period, to distribute gasoline which does not meet the requirements for reformulated gasoline, or does not contain the type(s) and amount(s) of oxygenate required under § 80.69(b)(1), if:
              (a) It is in the public interest to do so (e.g., distribution of the nonconforming gasoline is necessary to meet projected shortfalls which cannot otherwise be compensated for);

              (b) The refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender exercised prudent planning and was not able to avoid the violation and has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of the nonconformity;
              (c) The refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender can show how the requirements for reformulated gasoline will be expeditiously achieved;
              (d) The refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender agrees to make up air quality detriment associated with the nonconforming gasoline, where practicable; and
              (e) The refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender pays to the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to the economic benefit of the nonconformity minus the amount expended, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, in making up the air quality detriment.

              (i) No person may combine any reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is subject to the simple model standards with any reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is subject to the complex model standards, except that such gasolines may be combined at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility;

              (ii) No person may combine any reformulated gasoline subject to the complex model standards that is produced at any refinery or is imported by any importer with any other reformulated gasoline that is produced at a different refinery or is imported by a different importer, unless the other refinery or importer has an identical baseline for meeting complex model standards during this period; and
              (iii) No person may combine any RBOB subject to the complex model standards that is produced at any refinery or is imported by any importer with any RBOB that is produced at a different refinery or is imported by a different importer, unless the other refinery or importer has an identical baseline for meeting complex model standards during this period.
              (10) The prohibitions against combining certain categories of gasoline under paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(7) and (a)(8) of this section do not apply in the case of a party who is changing the type of gasoline stored in a gasoline storage tank or the type of gasoline transported through a gasoline pipe or manifold within a single facility (a gasoline storage tank, pipe, or manifold change of service), or in the case of a change of service that involves mixing gasoline with blendstock, provided that:
              (i) The change of service is for a legitimate operational reason and is not for the purpose of combining the categories of gasoline or of combining gasoline with blendstock;
              (ii) Prior to adding product of the new category the volume of product of the old category in the tank, pipe or manifold is made as low as possible through normal pumping operations;
              (iii) The volume of product of the new category that is added to the tank, pipe or manifold is as large as possible taking into account the availability of product of the new category; and
              (iv) In any case where the new category of product is reformulated gasoline, subsequent to adding the gasoline of the new category, a representative sample from the tank, pipe or manifold is collected and analyzed, and such analysis shows compliance with each standard under § 80.41 that is relevant to the new gasoline category. The analysis for each standard must be conducted using the method specified under § 80.46, or using another method that is approved by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), provided that the protocols of the ASTM method are followed and the alternative method is correlated to the method specified under § 80.46.
              (11) The prohibition against combining reformulated gasoline with RBOB under paragraph (a)(7) of this section does not apply in the case of a party who is changing the type of product stored in a tank from which trucks are loaded, from reformulated gasoline to RBOB, or vice versa, provided that:
              (i) The change of service requirements described in paragraph (a)(10) of this section cannot be met without taking the storage tank out of service;
              (ii) Prior to adding product of the new category the volume of product of the old category in the tank is drawn down to the lowest point which allows trucks to be loaded during the transition;
              (iii) The volume of product of the new category that is added to the tank is as large as possible taking into account the availability of product of the new category;
              (iv) When transitioning from RBOB to reformulated gasoline, the reformulated gasoline must meet all applicable standards that apply at the terminal subsequent to any oxygenate blending;
              (v) When transitioning from reformulated gasoline to RBOB:
              (A) The oxygen content of the reformulated gasoline produced using the RBOB must be not less than the minimum oxygen amount specified in the RBOB product transfer documents;
              (B) Subsequent to any oxygenate blending, the reformulated gasoline produced using the RBOB must meet all applicable standards that apply at the terminal; and
              (C) The transition from reformulated gasoline to RBOB may not begin until the date the VOC-control standards no longer apply to the terminal; and

              (vi) The party must demonstrate compliance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(11)(iv) and (v) of this section through testing of samples collected from the terminal storage tank and from trucks loaded at the terminal subsequent to each receipt of new product until the transition is complete. The analyses must be conducted using the test method specified under § 80.46, or using another test method that is approved by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), provided that the protocols of the ASTM method are followed and the alternative method is correlated with the method specified under § 80.46.
              (12)(i) The prohibited activities specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply in the case of gasoline that is used to fuel aircraft, or racing motor vehicles or racing boats that are used only in sanctioned racing events, provided that product transfer documents associated with such gasoline, and any pump stand from which such gasoline is dispensed, identify the gasoline either as conventional gasoline that is restricted for use in aircraft, or as conventional gasoline that is restricted for use in racing motor vehicles or racing boats that are used only in sanctioned racing events.
              (ii) A vehicle shall be considered to be a racing vehicle only if the vehicle:
              (A) Is operated in conjunction with sanctioned racing events;
              (B) Exhibits racing features and modifications such that it is incapable of safe and practical street or highway use;
              (C) Is not licensed, and is not licensable, by any state for operation on public streets or highways;
              (D) Is not operated on public streets or highways; and
              (E) Could not be converted to public street or highway use at a cost that is reasonable compared to the value of the vehicle.

              (iii)(A) That it has conducted a quality assurance sampling and testing program, as described in paragraph (c) of this section; except that
              (B) A carrier may rely on the quality assurance program carried out by another party, including the party that owns the gasoline in question, provided that the quality assurance program is carried out properly.
              (2)(i) Where a violation is found at a facility which is operating under the corporate, trade or brand name of a refiner, that refiner must show, in addition to the defense elements required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the violation was caused by:
              (A) An act in violation of law (other than the Act or this part), or an act of sabotage or vandalism;
              (B) The action of any reseller, distributor, oxygenate blender, carrier, or a retailer or wholesale purchaser- consumer supplied by any of these persons, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner designed to prevent such action, and despite periodic sampling and testing by the refiner to ensure compliance with such contractual obligation; or
              (C) The action of any carrier or other distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by the refiner for transportation of gasoline, despite specification or inspection of procedures and equipment by the refiner which are reasonably calculated to prevent such action.
              (ii) In this paragraph (b), to show that the violation “was caused” by any of the specified actions the party must demonstrate by reasonably specific showings, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.
              (c) Quality assurance program. In order to demonstrate an acceptable quality assurance program for reformulated gasoline at all points in the gasoline distribution network, other than at retail outlets and wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities, a party must present evidence of the following.
              (1) Of a periodic sampling and testing program to determine if the applicable maximum and/or minimum standards for oxygen, benzene, RVP, or VOC emission performance are met. For gasoline subject to the provisions in § 80.81, a party is not required to conduct periodic sampling and testing to determine compliance with the oxygen minimum standard.
              (2) That on each occasion when gasoline is found in noncompliance with one of the requirements referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
              (i) The party immediately ceases selling, offering for sale, dispensing, supplying, offering for supply, storing, transporting, or causing the transportation of the violating product; and
              (ii) The party promptly remedies the violation (such as by removing the violating product or adding more complying product until the applicable standards are achieved).

              (3) An oversight program conducted by a carrier under paragraph (c)(1) of this section need not include periodic sampling and testing of gasoline in a tank truck operated by a common carrier, but in lieu of such tank truck sampling and testing the common carrier shall demonstrate evidence of an oversight program for monitoring compliance with the requirements of § 80.78 relating to the transport or storage of gasoline by tank truck, such as appropriate guidance to drivers on compliance with applicable requirements and the periodic review of records normally received in the ordinary course of business concerning gasoline quality and delivery.

              § 80.82
              Butane blending.
              A refiner for any refinery that produces gasoline by blending butane with previously certified gasoline (PCG) may meet the sampling and testing requirements for this part as follows:
              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (i) of this section, any refinery that blends butane for which the refinery has documents from the butane supplier which demonstrate that the butane is commercial grade, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, may demonstrate compliance with the standards in this part based on the properties specified in paragraph (c) of this section, or the properties specified by the butane supplier.

              (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (i) of this section, any refiner that blends butane for which the refiner has documents from the butane supplier which demonstrate that the butane is non-commercial grade, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, may demonstrate compliance with the standards in this part based on the properties specified in paragraph (d) of this section, or the properties specified by the butane supplier, provided that the refinery—
              (i) Conducts a quality assurance program of sampling and testing the butane obtained from each separate butane supplier which demonstrates that the butane has the properties specified in paragraph (d) of this section; and
              (ii) The frequency of sampling and testing for the butane received from each butane supplier must be one sample for every 500,000 gallons of butane received, or one sample every three months, whichever is more frequent.
              (2) Where test results indicate the butane does not meet the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the refiner may—
              (i) Blend the butane with conventional gasoline, or reformulated gasoline that has been downgraded to conventional gasoline, provided the equivalent emissions performance of the butane batch, as determined using the provisions in § 80.101(g)(3), meets the refinery's standards under § 80.101 and the refiner meets all of the standards and requirements applicable to refiners of conventional gasoline under this part;
              (ii) Blend the butane with reformulated gasoline or RBOB, provided that the final batch of butane blended with reformulated gasoline or RBOB meets the applicable per-gallon standards in § 80.41(e), as determined using the test methods in § 80.46 or § 80.47, as applicable.
              (c) Commercial grade butane is defined as butane for which test results demonstrate that the butane is 95% pure and has all the following properties:
              (1) Olefins ≤1.0 vol%.
              (2) Aromatics ≤2.0 vol%.
              (3) Benzene ≤0.03 vol%.
              (4) Sulfur ≤30 ppm from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2016; ≤10 ppm beginning January 1, 2017 and thereafter.
              (d) Non-commercial grade butane is defined as butane for which test results demonstrate the butane has all the following properties:
              (1) Olefins ≤10.0 vol%.
              (2) Aromatics ≤2.0 vol%.
              (3) Benzene ≤0.03 vol%.
              (4) Sulfur ≤30 ppm beginning January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2016; ≤10 ppm beginning January 1, 2017 and thereafter.
              (e)(1) When butane is blended with conventional gasoline under this section during the period May 1 through September 15, the refiner shall demonstrate through sampling and testing, using the test method for Reid vapor pressure in § 80.46 or § 80.47, as applicable, that each batch of conventional gasoline blended with butane meets the volatility standards specified in § 80.27 and in any EPA approved SIP.
              (2) Butane may not be blended with any reformulated gasoline or RBOB during the period April 1 through September 30, or with any reformulated gasoline or RBOB designated as VOC-controlled, under this section.
              (f) When butane is blended with previously certified gasoline under this section, product transfer documents which accompany the gasoline blended with butane must comply with all of the requirements of § 80.77 or § 80.106, as appropriate.
              (g) Butane blended with previously certified gasoline during a period of up to one month may be included in a single batch for purposes of reporting to EPA, however, commercial grade butane and non-commercial grade butane must be reported as separate batches.
              (h) Where a refiner chooses to include butane blended with gasoline in the refinery's annual average compliance calculations—
              (1) In the case of butane blended with conventional gasoline, the equivalent emissions performance of the butane must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 80.101(g)(3). For purposes of this paragraph (h)(1), the property values in § 80.82(c) or (d), as appropriate, may be used;
              (2) In the case of butane blended with reformulated gasoline or RBOB, compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards may not be demonstrated using the provisions of this section;

              (3) All butane blended into gasoline during the annual averaging period must be included in annual average compliance calculations for the refinery.
              (i) A refiner who only blends commercial grade or non-commercial grade butane into PCG may meet the sampling and testing requirements of this part by meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (f) and (h)(3) of this section and all the following additional requirements:
              (1) The per-gallon sulfur content of every batch of butane must not exceed 30 ppm from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2016, and 10 ppm beginning January 1, 2017 and thereafter.
              (2) The refiner obtains test results from the butane supplier that demonstrate that the sulfur content of each load does not exceed the applicable per-gallon sulfur standard under paragraph (i)(1) of this section through test results of samples of butane contained in the storage tank from which the butane blender is supplied.
              (i) Sampling and testing for the sulfur content of the butane by the supplier must be subsequent to each receipt of butane into the supplier's storage tank or the sampling and testing must be immediately before transfer of butane to the butane blender.
              (ii) The testing must be performed in accord with the provisions of § 80.46, § 80.47, or other test methods as approved by the Administrator as applicable.
              (iii) The butane blender must obtain a copy of the butane supplier's test results at the time of each transfer of butane to the butane blender.
              (3) The sulfur content and volume of each batch of gasoline produced is that of the butane that the refiner blends into PCG for the purposes of calculating compliance with the applicable per-gallon sulfur standard.
              (4) The requirements of paragraphs (i)(1) through (3) of this section apply regardless of whether the butane is commercial grade or non-commercial grade.
              (5) The quality assurance testing requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies regardless of whether the butane is commercial grade or non-commercial grade.
              (6) If any of the requirements of this paragraph (i) are not met, in whole or in part for any butane blended into gasoline, that butane is deemed in violation of the gasoline standards in § 80.1603(a).
              (j) The PCG procedures of § 80.1640 may be used to meet the sampling and testing requirements of subpart O of this part.

              § 80.83
              Renewable oxygenate requirements.
              (a) Definition of renewable oxygenate. For purposes of subparts D and F of this part, renewable oxygenate is defined as provided in this paragraph (a).
              (1) In the case of oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is not designated as VOC-controlled or that is not subject to the additional requirements associated with an extended non-commingling season pursuant to § 80.83(i), renewable oxygenate shall be:
              (i) An oxygenate that is derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks; or
              (ii) An ether that is produced using an oxygenate that is derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks.
              (2) In the case of oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is designated as VOC-controlled or that is subject to the additional requirements associated with an extended non-commingling season pursuant to § 80.83(i), renewable oxygenate shall be an ether that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(3) of this section.
              (3) An oxygenate other than those ethers specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be considered a renewable oxygenate if the Administrator approves a petition to that effect. The Administrator may approve such a petition if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the oxygenate does not cause volatility increases in gasoline that are non-linear in nature (i.e., a non-linear vapor pressure blending curve). The Administrator may approve a petition subject to any appropriate conditions or limitations.

              (4)(i) Oxygenate shall be renewable only if the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender who uses the oxygenate is able to establish in the form of documentation that the oxygenate was produced from a non-fossil fuel feedstock.
              (ii)(A) Any person who produces renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or who stores, transports, transfers, or sells such renewable oxygenate, and where such renewable oxygenate is intended to be used in the production of gasoline, shall maintain documents that state the renewable source of the oxygenate, and shall supply to any transferee of the oxygenate documents which state the oxygenate is from a renewable source.
              (B) Any person who imports oxygenate that is represented by the importer to be renewable oxygenate, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, shall maintain documents, obtained from the person who produced the oxygenate, that include a certification signed by the owner or chief executive officer of the company that produced the oxygenate that states:
              (1) The nature of the feedstock for the oxygenate; and
              (2) A description of the manner in which the oxygenate meets the renewable definition under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (iii) No person may represent any oxygenate as renewable unless the oxygenate meets the renewable definition under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (5) For purposes of this section, an oxygenate shall be considered to be derived from non-fossil fuel feedstocks only if the oxygenate is:
              (i) Derived from a source other than petroleum, coal, natural gas, or peat; or
              (ii) Derived from a product:
              (A) That was produced using petroleum, coal, natural gas, or peat through a substantial transformation of the fossil fuel;
              (B) When the product was initially produced, it was not commonly used to generate energy (e.g. automobile tires); and
              (C) The product was sold or transferred for a use other than energy generation, and was later treated as a waste product.
              (b) Renewable oxygenate standard. (1) The reformulated gasoline and reformulated gasoline produced using RBOB that is produced by any refiner at each refinery, or is imported by any importer, shall contain a volume of renewable oxygenate such that the reformulated gasoline and reformulated gasoline produced using RBOB, on average, has an oxygen content from such renewable oxygenate that is equal to or greater than 0.30 wt% for the period of December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995, and 0.60 wt% beginning on January 1, 1996.
              (2) The averaging period for the renewable oxygenate standard specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be:
              (i) Each calendar year; except that
              (ii) Any reformulated gasoline and RBOB that is produced or imported prior to January 1, 1995 shall be averaged with reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced or imported during 1995.
              (3)(i) The oxygenate used to meet the standard under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may also be used to meet any oxygen standard under § 80.41; except that
              (ii) The renewable oxygenate added by a downstream oxygenate blender shall not be used by any refiner or importer to meet the oxygen standard under § 80.41, except through the transfer of oxygen credits.
              (c) Downstream oxygenate blending using renewable oxygenate. (1) In the case of any refiner that produces RBOB, or any importer that imports RBOB, the oxygenate that is blended with the RBOB may be included with the refiner's or importer's compliance calculations under paragraph (d) of this section only if:
              (i) The oxygenate meets the applicable renewable oxygenate definition under paragraph (a) of this section; and
              (ii) The refiner or importer meets the downstream oxygenate blending oversight requirements specified in §§ 80.69(a)(6) and (7); or
              (iii)(A) In the case of RBOB designated for “any renewable oxygenate” the refiner or importer assumes that ethanol will be blended with the RBOB;

              (B) In the case of RBOB designated for “renewable ether only” or “non-VOC controlled renewable ether only “, the refiner or importer assumes that ETBE will be blended with the RBOB; and
              (C) In the case of “any renewable oxygenate,” “non-VOC controlled renewable ether only” and “renewable ether only RBOB,” the refiner or importer assumes that the volume of oxygenate added will be such that the resulting reformulated gasoline will have an oxygen content of 2.0 wt%.
              (2)(i) No person may combine any oxygenate with RBOB designated as “any renewable oxygenate” unless the oxygenate meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (ii) No person may combine any oxygenate with RBOB designated as “renewable ether only” or “non-VOC controlled renewable ether only” unless the oxygenate meets the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (d) Compliance calculation. (1) Any refiner for each of its refineries, and any importer shall, for each averaging period, determine compliance with the renewable oxygenate standard by calculating:
              (i) Prior to January 1, 1996, renewable oxygen compliance total using the following formula:
              
                ER02AU94.000
              
              (ii) Beginning on January 1, 1996, the renewable oxygen compliance total using the following formula:
              
                ER02AU94.001
              
              
                where
                
                CTro = the compliance total for renewable oxygen
                Vi = the volume of reformulated gasoline or RBOB batch i
                n = the number of batches of reformulated gasoline and RBOB produced or imported during the averaging period
              
              
              (iii) The renewable oxygen actual total using the following formula:
              
                ER02AU94.002
              
              
                where
                
                ATro = the actual total for renewable oxygen
                Vi = the volume of gasoline or RBOB batch i
                ROi = the oxygen content, in wt%, in the form of renewable oxygenate of gasoline or RBOB batch i
                n = the number of batches of gasoline or RBOB produced or imported during the averaging period
              
              
              (iv) Compare the renewable oxygen actual total with the renewable oxygen compliance total.
              (2)(i) The actual total must be equal to or greater than the compliance totals to achieve compliance, subject to the credit transfer provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.
              (ii) If the renewable oxygen actual total is less than the renewable oxygen compliance total, renewable oxygen credits must be obtained from another refinery or importer in order to achieve compliance.
              (iii) The total number of renewable oxygen credits required to achieve compliance is calculated by subtracting the renewable oxygen actual total from the renewable oxygen compliance total.
              (iv) If the renewable oxygen actual total is greater than the renewable oxygen compliance total, renewable oxygen credits are generated.
              (v) The total number of renewable oxygen credits which may be traded to a refiner for a refinery, or to another importer, is calculated by subtracting the renewable oxygen compliance total from the renewable oxygen actual total.
              (e) Credit transfers. Compliance with the renewable oxygenate standard specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be achieved through the transfer of renewable oxygen credits, provided that the credits meet the criteria specified in §§ 80.67(h)(1) (i) through (iv) and §§ 80.67(h) (2) and (3).
              (f) Recordkeeping. Any refiner or importer, or any oxygenate blender who blends oxygenate with any RBOB designated as “any renewable oxygenate,” “non VOC controlled renewable ether only” or “renewable ether only” shall for a period of five years maintain the records specified in this paragraph (f) in a manner consistent with the requirements under § 80.74, and deliver such records to the Administrator upon request. The records shall contain the following information:
              
              (1)(i) Documents demonstrating the renewable nature and source of the oxygenate used, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section;
              (ii) The volume, type, and purity of any renewable oxygenate used; and
              (iii) Product transfer documentation for all renewable oxygenate, reformulated gasoline, or RBOB for which the party is the transferor or transferee.
              (2) The requirements of this paragraph (f) shall apply in addition to the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 80.74(e).
              (g) Reporting requirements. (1) Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall for each batch of reformulated gasoline and RBOB include in the quarterly reports for reformulated gasoline required by § 80.75(a) the total weight percent oxygen and the weight percent oxygen attributable to renewable oxygenate contained in the gasoline, or contained in the RBOB subsequent to oxygenate blending if allowed under paragraph (c) of this section.
              (2) Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall submit to the Administrator, with the fourth quarterly report required by § 80.75(a), a report for all reformulated gasoline and RBOB that was produced or imported during the previous calendar year averaging period, that includes the following information:
              (i) The total volume of reformulated gasoline and RBOB;
              (ii) The compliance total for renewable oxygen;
              (iii) The actual total for renewable oxygen;
              (iv) The number of renewable oxygen credits generated as a result of actual total renewable oxygen being greater than compliance total renewable oxygen;
              (v) The number of renewable oxygen credits required as a result of actual total renewable oxygen being less than compliance total renewable oxygen;
              (vi) The number of renewable oxygen credits transferred to another refinery or importer;
              (vii) The number of renewable oxygen credits obtained from another refinery or importer; and
              (viii) For any renewable oxygen credits that are transferred from or to another refinery or importer, for any such transfer:
              (A) The names, EPA-assigned registration numbers and facility identification numbers of the transferor and transferee of the credits;
              (B) The number of renewable oxygen credits that were transferred; and
              (C) The date of the transaction.
              (h) Renewable oxygenate requirements for reformulated gasoline used in the State of California. (1) Any refiner or importer of California gasoline, as defined in § 80.81, shall meet the renewable oxygenate standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section for all reformulated gasoline or RBOB used in any reformulated gasoline covered area as specified in § 80.70.
              (2) Any California gasoline shall be presumed to be used in a reformulated gasoline covered area:
              (i)(A) If the gasoline is produced at a refinery that is located within a reformulated gasoline covered area; or
              (B) If the gasoline is transported to a facility that is located within a reformulated gasoline covered area, or to a facility from which gasoline is transported by truck into a reformulated gasoline covered area; unless
              (ii) The refiner or importer is able to establish with documentation that the gasoline was used outside any reformulated gasoline covered area.
              (3) Any California gasoline shall be considered to be designated as VOC-controlled (for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section) if the Reid vapor pressure of the gasoline, or RBOB subsequent to oxygenate blending, is intended to meet a standard of:
              (i) 7.8 psi or less in the case of gasoline intended for use before March 1, 1996; or
              (ii) 7.0 psi or less in the case of gasoline intended for use on or after March 1, 1996.
              (i) Special provisions for shoulder season. (1) The Governor of any State may petition for an extension of the non-commingling season for any or all reformulated gasoline covered areas within the State pursuant to § 80.70.
              (i) Such petition must satisfy the following criteria:

              (A) Evidence showing an increase in the market share and/or use of oxygenates which produce commingling-related RVP increases in the area(s) that are covered by the petition;
              (B) Evidence demonstrating a pattern of exceedances for the period for which the extension is sought, including ozone monitoring data for the preceding three(3) years of the reformulated gasoline program;
              (C) An analysis showing that the pattern of ozone exceedances is likely to continue even with implementation of other ozone air quality control measures and/or programs currently planned by the State; and
              (D) Evidence that the responsible State agency or authority has given the public an opportunity for a public hearing and the submission of written comments with respect to the petition.
              (ii) Effective data and publication of decision.

              (A) If the Administrator determines that the petition meets the requirements of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, then EPA shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing its intention to establish the non-commingling season as requested by the Governor, and specifying a tentative effective date.
              (1) The Administrator shall provide the public with an opportunity for a hearing and the submission of written comments.
              (2) The tentative effective date will correspond with the first day of the next complete non-commingling season beginning not less than one year after receipt of the petition.

              (B) If the Administrator receives adverse comments or information demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the criteria of paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section have not been met, that the tentative effective date is not reasonable, or that other good reasons exist to deny the petition, then the Administrator may reject the Governor's request for an extended non-commingling season, in whole or in part, or may delay the effective date by up to two (2) additional years. Absent receipt of such adverse comments or information, EPA shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing its approval of the petition and specifying an effective date for the extended non-commingling season.
              (2) In the case of any refiner that produces RBOB, or any importer that imports RBOB, the oxygenate that is blended with the RBOB may be included with the refiner's or importer's compliance calculations under paragraph (d) of this section only if:
              (i) The oxygenate meets the applicable renewable oxygenate definition under paragraph (a) of this section; and
              (ii) In the case of RBOB designated for “non VOC controlled ether only” the refiner or importer assumes that ETBE or other oxygenate that does not exhibit volatility-related commingling effects when mixed with other gasolines and approved by the EPA Administrator under subparagraph (a)(3) of this section will be blended with the RBOB and so labels the transfer documentation.

                Effective Date Note:
                At 59 FR 39290, Aug. 2, 1994, § 80.83 was added, effective Sept. 1, 1994, except for paragraphs (g) and (h), which would not become effective until approval had been given by the Office of Management and Budget. At 59 FR 60715, Nov. 28, 1994, this section was stayed, effective Sept. 13, 1994. At 70 FR 74571, Dec. 15, 2005, § 80.83 was revised; however, the amendment could not be incorporated because the section is stayed.
              
            
            
              § 80.84
              Treatment of interface and transmix.
              (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
              (1) Interface means a volume of petroleum product generated in a pipeline between two adjacent volumes of non-identical petroleum product that consists of a mixture of the two adjacent products.
              (2) Transmix means an interface that does not meet the specifications for a fuel that can be used or sold, and that is composed solely of any combination of:
              (i) Previously certified gasoline (including previously certified gasoline blendstocks that become gasoline solely upon the addition of an oxygenate);
              (ii) Distillate fuel; or

              (iii) Gasoline blendstocks that are suitable for use as a blendstock without further processing.
              
              (3) Transmix gasoline product, or TGP, means the gasoline or gasoline blendstock that is produced when transmix is separated into distillate fuel and either gasoline or gasoline blendstock. Gasoline blendstock here includes blendstock that becomes gasoline solely upon the addition of an oxygenate (such as RBOB).
              (4) Transmix processing facility means any refinery that produces TGP from transmix by distillation or other refining processes, but does not produce gasoline by processing crude oil.
              (5) Transmix processor means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises a transmix processing facility.
              (6) Transmix blending facility means any facility which produces gasoline by blending transmix into gasoline.
              (7) Transmix blender means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises a transmix blending facility.
              (b) Designation of gasoline interface by pipeline operators. (1) Gasoline interface mixtures containing the products below shall be designated by pipeline operators in the following manner:
              (i) Interface mixtures of reformulated gasoline or RBOB, and conventional gasoline shall be designated as conventional gasoline;
              (ii) Interface mixtures of VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline and non-VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline shall be designated as non-VOC-controlled RFG;
              (iii) Interface mixtures of RBOB and reformulated gasoline shall be designated as RBOB; and
              (iv) Interface mixtures of reformulated gasoline or RBOB, and blendstock shall be designated as blendstock.
              (2) Regardless of gasoline product designation, all gasoline containing interface must meet all downstream standards, including but not limited to any standards and requirements that apply downstream of the refinery in this part and the Clean Air Act.
              (c) Transmix processing—(1) TGP sold without further mixing with blendstocks or previously certified gasoline. (i) Where the TGP meets all standards and requirements that apply to conventional gasoline downstream from the refinery, including but not limited to any standards and requirements in this part and the Clean Air Act, and the TGP is designated and sold as conventional gasoline, the transmix processor may exclude the TGP from compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility under this part Subpart E of this part. Except as required in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the transmix processor must either include every batch or exclude every batch of this TGP from their compliance calculations for each compliance period;
              (ii) Where the TGP is sold as a blendstock, the transmix processor must exclude the TGP from compliance calculations. Pursuant to § 80.101(d)(3), however, TGP which becomes gasoline solely upon the addition of an oxygenate must be included in the compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility under subpart E of this part.
              (iii) Where the TGP is designated and sold as reformulated gasoline or RBOB, the transmix processor must fulfill all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under subpart D of this part and must include the reformulated gasoline or RBOB produced from the transmix in compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility under subpart D of this part.
              (2) TGP blended with blendstocks. Where the transmix processor mixes the TGP with blendstock(s) to produce reformulated or conventional gasoline or RBOB, the TGP is treated as a blendstock and the transmix processor must fulfill all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under subpart D or E of this part, as appropriate, and include the gasoline produced in compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility under subpart D or E of this part, as appropriate.
              (3) TGP blended with previously certified gasoline. (i) Where the TGP meets all the standards and requirements that apply to conventional gasoline downstream from the refinery, including but not limited to any standards and requirements of this part and the Clean Air Act, and the transmix processor mixes the TGP with any previously certified gasoline to produce conventional gasoline, the TGP may be excluded from compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility under subpart E of this part. Except as required in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the transmix processor must either include every batch or exclude every batch of this TGP from compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility for each compliance period.
              (ii) Where the TGP does not meet all standards that apply to conventional gasoline downstream from the refinery, including but not limited to any standards and requirements of this part and the Clean Air Act, and the transmix processor mixes the TGP with any previously certified gasoline to produce conventional gasoline, the TGP is treated as a blendstock and the transmix processor must fulfill all requirements and standards for a refiner under subpart E of this part, for the TGP, and include the TGP in the compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility under subpart E of this part.
              (iii) The sampling and testing required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section may be met using one of the following methods:
              (A) Sample and test the TGP prior to blending with previously certified gasoline to determine the volume and properties of the TGP and include each volume of TGP blended with previously certified gasoline as a separate batch in compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility; or
              (B) Determine the volume and properties of the previously certified gasoline prior to blending with the TGP and measure the volume and properties of the gasoline subsequent to blending with the TGP. Calculate the volume and properties of the TGP by subtracting the volume and properties of the previously certified gasoline from the volume and properties of the gasoline subsequent to blending, and include each volume of TGP blended with previously certified gasoline as a separate batch in compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility; or
              (C) Comply with the requirements in § 80.101(g)(9).
              (iv) Where the transmix processor mixes the TGP with any previously certified gasoline to produce reformulated gasoline or RBOB, the TGP is treated as a blendstock and the transmix processor must fulfill all requirements and standards for a refiner under subpart D of this part, for the TGP, and include the TGP in the compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility under subpart D of this part, using the procedures in § 80.65(i).
              (4) Additional requirements for conventional gasoline produced with transmix containing blendstocks. Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, if gasoline is produced at a transmix processing facility from any transmix containing gasoline blendstocks, the transmix processor must include every batch of gasoline produced from transmix in compliance calculations for the transmix processing facility under subpart E of this part for the entire compliance period.
              (d) Transmix blending. Transmix blenders which fulfill all of the requirements in this paragraph (d) are exempt from the requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under subparts D and E of this part.
              (1) Transmix may be blended into any previously certified gasoline, provided that:

              (i) The endpoint of the final transmix-blended gasoline does not exceed 437 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM standard method D 86-01e1, entitled “Standard Test Method for Distillation of Petroleum Products at Atmospheric Pressure”, which is incorporated by reference. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

              (ii) The final transmix-blended gasoline meets all applicable downstream standards; and
              
              (iii) The transmix blender complies with the requirements in §§ 80.74(b)(10), 80.104(b) and 80.213.
              (2) The transmix blender must maintain and follow a written quality assurance program designed to assure that the type and amount of transmix blended into previously certified gasoline will not cause violations of the applicable standards in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, as a part of the quality assurance program, transmix blenders shall collect samples of gasoline subsequent to blending transmix, and test the samples to ensure the end-point temperature of the final transmix-blended gasoline does not exceed 437 degrees Fahrenheit, at one of the following rates:
              (i) In the case of transmix that is blended in a tank, following each occasion transmix is blended; or
              (ii) In the case of transmix that is blended by a computer controlled in-line blending system, the transmix blender shall collect composite samples of gasoline subsequent to blending transmix at a rate of not less than twice each calendar month during which transmix is blended.
              (3) Any transmix blender may petition EPA for approval of a quality assurance program that does not include the minimum sampling and testing requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In order to seek such an exemption, the transmix blender shall submit a petition to EPA that includes:
              (i) A detailed description of the quality assurance procedures to be carried out at each location where transmix is blended into previously certified gasoline, including a description of how the transmix blender proposes to determine the ratio of transmix that can be blended with previously certified gasoline without violating any of the applicable standards in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and a description of how the transmix blender proposes to determine that the gasoline produced by the transmix blending operation meets the applicable standards.
              (ii) If the transmix is blended by a computer controlled in-line blending system, the transmix blender shall also include all of the information required by refiners under § 80.65(f)(4)(i)(A).
              (iii) A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this paragraph.
              (iv) Transmix blenders who seek an exemption under paragraph (d)(3) of this section must comply with any request by EPA for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption. However, they may withdraw their exemption petition or approved exemption at any time, upon notice to EPA.
              (v) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the transmix blender's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the end-point temperature of the gasoline produced, or if EPA determines that any other circumstance exists which merits modification of the requirements of an exemption. If EPA finds that a transmix blender provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the transmix blender's exemption will be void ab initio.
              (4) In the event the test results for any sample collected pursuant to a quality assurance program indicate the gasoline does not comply with any of the applicable standards in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the transmix blender shall:
              (i) Immediately take steps to stop the sale of the gasoline that was sampled;
              (ii) Take steps which are reasonably calculated to determine the cause of the noncompliance and to prevent future instances of noncompliance;
              (iii) Inform EPA of the noncompliance; and

              (iv) If the transmix was blended by a computer controlled in-line blending system, increase the rate of sampling and testing to a rate of not less than once per week and continue the increased frequency of sampling and testing until the results of ten consecutive samples and tests indicate the gasoline complies with applicable standards, at which time the sampling and testing may be conducted at the original frequency;
              (5) Any transmix blender who blends transmix into previously certified gasoline and who does not meet the requirements under this paragraph (d) shall meet all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under subparts D and E of this part, other than this section and §§ 80.74(b)(10), and 80.104(b).
              (e) The provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section also apply to mixtures of gasoline and distillate fuel:
              (1) Produced by unintentionally combining gasoline and distillate fuel in a tank.
              (2) Produced from normal business operations at terminals or pipelines, such as gasoline or distillate fuel drained from a tank, or drained from piping or hoses used to transfer gasoline or distillate fuel to tanks or trucks, or gasoline or distillate fuel discharged from a safety relief valve.
              (f) Any transmix processor or transmix blender who adds a feedstock to their transmix other than gasoline, distillate fuel or gasoline blendstocks from pipeline interface must meet all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under subparts D and E of this part, other than this section and §§ 80.74(b)(10), and 80.104(b), for all gasoline they produce during a compliance period.

              (d) Baseline exhaust toxics emissions. The annual average baseline exhaust toxics emissions for any facility of a refiner or importer of conventional gasoline shall be determined as follows:
              (1) The summer and winter baseline exhaust emissions of benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, and polycyclic organic matter shall be determined using the oxygenated individual baseline fuel parameter values for summer and winter (per § 80.91), respectively, in the appropriate complex model for each exhaust toxic (per § 80.45).
              (2) The summer and winter baseline total exhaust toxics emissions shall be determined separately by summing the summer and winter baseline exhaust emissions of each toxic (per paragraph (d)(1) of this section), respectively.
              (3) The annual average baseline exhaust toxics emissions of the facility shall be determined using the emissions values determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in the equation specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (e) Baseline NO
                X
                emissions. The annual average baseline NOX emissions for any facility of a refiner or importer of conventional gasoline shall be determined as follows:
              (1) The summer and winter baseline NOX emissions shall be determined using the baseline individual baseline fuel parameter values for summer and winter (per § 80.91), respectively, in the appropriate complex model for NOX (per § 80.45).
              (2) The annual average baseline NOX emissions of the facility shall be determined using the emissions values determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section in the equation specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
              (3) The requirements specified in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section shall be determined separately using the oxygenated and nonoxygenated individual baseline fuel parameters, per § 80.91.

              § 80.91
              Individual baseline determination.
              (a) Baseline definition. (1) The “baseline” or “individual baseline” of a refinery, refiner or importer, as applicable, shall consist of:

              (i) An estimate of the quality, composition and volume of its 1990 gasoline, or allowable substitute, based on the requirements specified in §§ 80.91 through 80.93; and
              
              (ii) Its baseline emissions values calculated per paragraph (f) of this section.
              (2)(i) The quality and composition of the 1990 gasoline of a refinery, refiner or importer, as applicable, shall be the set of values of the following fuel parameters: benzene content; aromatic content; olefin content; sulfur content; distillation temperature at 50 and 90 percent by volume evaporated; percent evaporated at 200 °F and 300 °F; oxygen content; RVP.
              (ii) A refiner, per paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, shall also determine the API gravity of its 1990 gasoline.
              (3) The methodology outlined in this section shall be followed in determining a baseline value for each fuel parameter listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (b) Requirements for refiners, blenders and importers—(1) Requirements for producers of gasoline and gasoline blendstocks. (i) A refinery engaged in the production of gasoline blendstocks from crude oil and/or crude oil derivatives, and the subsequent mixing of those blendstocks to form gasoline, shall have its baseline fuel parameter values determined from Method 1, 2 and/or 3-type data as described in paragraph (c) of this section, provided the refinery was in operation for at least 6 months in 1990.
              (ii) A refinery which was in operation for at least 6 months in 1990, was shut down after 1990, and which restarts after June 15, 1994, and for which insufficient 1990 and post-1990 data was collected prior to January 1, 1995 from which to determine an individual baseline, shall have the values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameters.
              (iii) A refinery which was in operation for less than 6 months in 1990 shall have the values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameters.
              (2) Requirements for producers or importers of gasoline blendstocks only. A refiner or importer of gasoline blendstocks which did not produce or import gasoline in 1990 and which produces or imports post-1994 gasoline shall have the values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameters.
              (3) Requirements for purchasers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks. (i) A refiner or refinery, as applicable, solely engaged in the production of gasoline from gasoline blendstocks and/or gasoline which are simply purchased and blended to form gasoline shall have its individual baseline determined using Method 1-type data (per paragraph (c) of this section) from every batch of 1990 gasoline.
              (ii) If Method 1-type data on every batch of the refiner's or refinery's 1990 gasoline does not exist, that refiner or refinery shall have the values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameters.
              (4) Requirements for importers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks. (i) An importer of gasoline shall determine an individual baseline value for each fuel parameter listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section using Method 1-type data on every batch of gasoline imported by that importer into the United States in 1990.
              (ii) An importer which is also a foreign refiner must determine its individual baseline using Method 1, 2 and/or 3-type data (per paragraph (c) of this section) if it imported at least 75 percent, by volume, of the gasoline produced at its foreign refinery in 1990 into the United States in 1990.
              (iii) An importer which cannot meet the criteria of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section for baseline determination shall have the parameter values listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section as its individual baseline parameter values.
              (5) Requirements for exporters of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks. A refiner shall not include quality or volume data on its 1990 exports of gasoline blendstocks or gasoline in its baseline determination.
              (c) Data types—(1) Method 1-type data. (i) Method 1-type data shall consist of quality (composition and property data) and volume records of gasoline produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990, excluding exported gasoline. The measured fuel parameter values and volumes of batches, or shipments if not batch blended, shall be used except that data on produced gasoline which was also shipped shall be included only once.
              
              (ii) Gasoline blendstock which left a facility in 1990 and which could become gasoline solely upon the addition of oxygenate shall be included in the baseline determination.
              (A) Fuel parameter values of such blendstock shall be accounted for as if the gasoline blendstock were blended with ten (10.0) volume percent ethanol.
              (B) If the refiner or importer can provide evidence that such gasoline blendstock was not blended per paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, and that such gasoline blendstock was blended with another oxygenate or a different volume of ethanol, the fuel parameter values of the final gasoline (including oxygenate) shall be included in the baseline determination.
              (C) If the refiner or importer can provide evidence that such gasoline blendstock was not blended per paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, and that such gasoline blendstock was sold with out further changes downstream, the fuel parameter values of the original product shall be included in the baseline determination.
              (iii) Data on 1990 gasoline purchased or otherwise received, including intracompany transfers, shall not be included in the baseline determination of a refiner's or importer's facility if the gasoline exited the receiving refinery unchanged from its arrival state.
              (2) Method 2-type data. Method 2-type data shall consist of 1990 gasoline blendstock quality data and 1990 blendstock production records, specifically the measured fuel parameter values and volumes of blendstock used in the production of gasoline within the refinery. Blendstock data shall include volumes purchased or otherwise received, including intracompany transfers, if the volumes were blended as part of the refiner's or importer's 1990 gasoline. Henceforth in §§ 80.91 through 80.93, “blendstock(s)” or “gasoline blendstock(s)” shall include those products or streams commercially blended to form gasoline.
              (3) Method 3-type data. (i) Method 3-type data shall consist of post-1990 gasoline blendstock and/or gasoline quality data and 1990 blendstock and gasoline production records, specifically the measured fuel parameter values and volumes of blendstock used in the production of gasoline within the refinery. Blendstock data shall include volumes purchased or otherwise received, including intracompany transfers, if the volumes were blended as part of the refiner's or importer's 1990 gasoline.
              (ii) In order to use Method 3-type data, the refiner or importer must do all of the following:
              (A) Include a detailed discussion comparing its 1990 and post-1990 refinery operations and all other differences which would cause the 1990 and post-1990 fuel parameter values to differ; and
              (B) Perform the appropriate calculations so as to adjust for the differences determined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section; and
              (C) Include a narrative, discussing the methodology and reasoning for the adjustments made per paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
              (iii) In order to use post-1990 gasoline data, either of the following must be shown for each blendstock-type included in 1990 gasoline, excluding butane:
              (A) The post-1990 volumetric fraction of a blendstock is within (±)10.0 percent of the volumetric fraction of that blendstock in 1990 gasoline. For example, if a 1990 blendstock constituted 30 volume percent of 1990 gasoline, this criterion would be met if the post-1990 volumetric fraction of the blendstock in post-1990 gasoline was 27.0-33.0 volume percent.
              (B) The post-1990 volumetric fraction of a blendstock is within (±)2.0 volume percent of the absolute value of the 1990 volumetric fraction. For example, if a 1990 blendstock constituted 5 volume percent of 1990 gasoline, this criterion would be met if the post-1990 volumetric fraction of the blendstock in post-1990 gasoline was 3-7 volume percent.
              (iv) If using post-1990 gasoline data, post-1990 gasoline blendstock which left a facility and which could become gasoline solely upon the addition of oxygenate shall be included in the baseline determination, per the requirements specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (4) Hierarchy of data use. (i) A refiner or importer must determine a baseline fuel parameter value using only Method 1-type data if sufficient Method 1-type data is available, per paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) If a refiner has insufficient Method 1-type data for a baseline parameter value determination, it must supplement that data with all available Method 2-type data, until it has sufficient data, per paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (iii) If a refiner has insufficient Method 1- and Method 2-type data for a baseline parameter value determination, it must supplement that data with all available Method 3-type data, until it has sufficient data, per paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (iv) The protocol for the determination of baseline fuel parameter values in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section shall be applied to each fuel parameter one at a time.
              (5) Anti-dumping statutory baseline. (i) The summer anti-dumping statutory baseline shall have the set of fuel parameter values identified as “summer” in § 80.45(b)(2). The anti-dumping summer API gravity shall be 57.4 °API.
              (ii) The winter anti-dumping statutory baseline shall have the set of fuel parameter values identified as “winter” in § 80.45(b)(2), except that winter RVP shall be 8.7 psi. The anti-dumping winter API gravity shall be 60.2 API.

              (iii) The annual average anti-dumping statutory baseline shall have the following set of fuel parameter values:
              
              
                Benzene, volume percent—1.60
                Aromatics, volume percent—28.6
                Olefins, volume percent—10.8
                RVP, psi—8.7
                T50, degrees F—207
                T90, degrees F—332
                E200, percent—46
                E300, percent—83
                Sulfur, ppm—338
                API Gravity, °API—59.1
              
              

              (iv) The annual average anti-dumping statutory baseline shall have the following set of emission values:
              
              
                Exhaust benzene emissions, simple model—6.45
                Exhaust benzene emissions, complex model—33.03 mg/mile
                Exhaust toxics emissions, Phase I—50.67 mg/mile
                Exhaust toxics emissions, Phase II—104.5 mg/mile

                NOX emissions, Phase II—1461. mg/mile
              
              
              (d) Data collection and testing requirements—(1) Minimum sampling requirements—(i) General requirements. (A) Data shall have been obtained for at least three months of the refiner's or importer's production of summer gasoline and at least three months of its production of winter gasoline. When method 1 per batch RVP data is available, a month is considered equivalent to 4 weeks of seasonal data.
              (1) Method 1, per batch, actual RVP data will be used to define that batch as either summer fuel or winter fuel. Summer fuel is defined as fuel produced and intended for sale to satisfy Federal summer volatility standards. When such per batch actual RVP data is not available, data is allocated per month as follows. A summer month is defined as any month during which more than 50 percent (by volume) of the gasoline produced by a refiner met the Federal summer gasoline volatility requirements. Winter shall be any month which could not be considered a summer month under this definition.
              (2) The three months which compose the summer and the winter data do not have to be consecutive nor within the same year.
              (3) If, in 1990, a refiner marketed all of its gasoline only in an area or areas which experience no seasonal changes relative to gasoline requirements, e.g., Hawaii, only 3 months of data are required.
              (B) Once the minimum sampling requirements have been met, data collection may cease. Additional data may only be included for the remainder of the calendar year in which the minimum sampling requirements were met. In any case, all data collected through the date of collection of the last data point included in the determination of a baseline fuel parameter value must be utilized in the baseline determination of that fuel parameter.
              (C) Less than the minimum requirements specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be allowed, upon petition and approval (per § 80.93), if it can be shown that the available data is sufficient in quality and quantity to use in the baseline determination.
              (ii) Method 1 sampling requirements. At least half of the batches, or shipments if not batch blended, in a calendar month shall have been sampled over a minimum of six months in 1990.
              (iii) Method 2 sampling requirements. (A) Continuous blendstock streams shall have been sampled at least weekly over a minimum of six months in 1990.
              (B) For blendstocks produced on a batch basis, at least half of all batches of a single blendstock type produced in a calendar month shall have been sampled over a minimum of six months in 1990.
              (iv) Method 3 sampling requirements—(A) Blendstock data. (1) Post-1990 continuous blendstock streams shall have been sampled at least weekly over a minimum of six months.
              (2) For post-1990 blendstocks produced on a batch basis, at least half of all batches of a single blendstock type produced in a calendar month shall have been sampled over a minimum of six months.
              (B) Gasoline data. At least half of the post-1990 batches, or shipments if not batch blended, in a calendar month shall have been sampled over a minimum of six months in order to use post-1990 gasoline data.
              (2) Sampling beyond today's date. The necessity and actual occurrence of data collection after today's date must be shown.
              (3) Negligible quantity sampling. Testing of a blendstock stream for a fuel parameter listed in this paragraph (d)(3) is not required if the refiner can show that the fuel parameter exists in the stream at less than or equal to the amount, on average, shown in this paragraph (d)(3) for that fuel parameter. Any fuel parameter shown to exist in a refinery stream in negligible amounts shall be assigned a value of 0.0:
              
              
                Aromatics, volume percent—1.0
                Benzene, volume percent—0.15
                Olefins, volume percent—1.0
                Oxygen, weight percent—0.2
                Sulfur, ppm—30.0
              
              
              (4) Sample compositing. (i) Samples of gasoline or blendstock which have been retained, but not analyzed, may be mixed prior to analysis and analyzed, as described in paragraphs (d)(4)(iii) (A) through (H) of this section, for the required fuel parameters. Samples must be from the same season and year and must be of a single grade or of a single type of batch-produced blendstock.
              (ii) Blendstock samples of a single blendstock type obtained from continuous processes over a calendar month may be mixed together in equal volumes to form one blendstock sample and the sample subsequently analyzed for the required fuel parameters.
              (iii)(A) Samples shall have been collected and stored per the method normally employed at the refinery in order to prevent change in product composition with regard to baseline properties and to minimize loss of volatile fractions of the sample.
              (B) Properties of the retained samples shall be adjusted for loss of butane by comparing the RVP measured right after blending with the RVP determined at the time that the supplemental properties are measured.
              (C) The volume of each batch or shipment sampled shall have been noted and the sum of the volumes calculated to the nearest hundred (100) barrels.
              (D) For each batch or shipment sampled, the ratio of its volume to the total volume determined in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(C) of this section shall be determined to three (3) decimal places. This shall be the volumetric fraction of the shipment in the mixture.
              (E) The total minimum volume required to perform duplicate analyses to obtain values of all of the required fuel parameters shall be determined.
              (F) The volumetric fraction determined in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(D) of this section for each batch or shipment shall be multiplied by the value determined in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(E) of this section.
              (G) The resulting value determined in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(F) of this section for each batch or shipment shall be the volume of each batch or shipment's sample to be added to the mixture. This volume shall be determined to the nearest milliliter.
              (H) The appropriate volumes of each shipment's sample shall be thoroughly mixed and the solution analyzed per the methods normally employed at the refinery.
              (5) Test methods. (i) If the test methods used to obtain fuel parameter values of gasoline and gasoline blendstocks differ or are otherwise not equivalent in precision or accuracy to the corresponding test method specified in § 80.46, results obtained under those procedures will only be acceptable, upon petition and approval (per § 80.93), if the procedures are or were industry-accepted procedures for measuring the properties of gasoline and gasoline blendstocks at the time the measurement was made.
              (ii) Oxygen content may have been determined analytically or from oxygenate blending records.
              (A) The fuel parameter values, other than oxygen content, specified in paragraph (a) of this section, must be established as for any blendstock, per the requirements of this paragraph (d).
              (B) All oxygen associated with allowable gasoline oxygenates per § 80.2(jj) shall be included in the determination of the baseline oxygen content, if oxygen content was determined analytically.
              (C) Oxygen content shall be assumed to be contributed solely by the oxygenate which is indicated on the blending records, if oxygen content was determined from blending records.
              (6) Data quality. Data may be excluded from the baseline determination if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of Mobile Sources, or designee, that it is not within the normal range of values expected for the gasoline or blendstock sample, considering unit configuration, operating conditions, etc.; due to:
              (i) Improper labeling; or
              (ii) Improper testing; or
              (iii) Other reasons as verified by the auditor specified in § 80.92.
              (e) Baseline fuel parameter determination—(1) Closely integrated gasoline producing facilities. Each refinery or blending facility must determine a set of baseline fuel parameter values per this paragraph (e). A single set of baseline fuel parameters may be determined, upon petition and approval, for two or more facilities under either of the following circumstances:
              (i) Two or more refineries or sets of gasoline blendstock-producing units of a refiner engaged in the production of gasoline per paragraph (b)(1) of this section which are geographically proximate to each other, yet not within a single refinery gate, and whose 1990 operations were significantly interconnected.
              (ii) A gasoline blending facility operating per paragraph (b)(3) of this section received at least 75 percent of its 1990 blendstock volume from a single refinery, or from one or more refineries which are part of an aggregate baseline per § 80.101(h). The blending facility and associated refinery(ies) must be owned by the same refiner.
              (2) Equations—(i) Parameter determinations. Average baseline fuel parameters shall be determined separately for summer and winter using summer and winter data (per paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section), respectively, in the applicable equation listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (ii) through (iv) of this section, except that average baseline winter RVP shall be 8.7 psi.
              (ii) Product included in parameter determinations. In each of the equations listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (ii) through (iv) of this section, the following shall apply:
              (A)(1) All gasoline produced to meet EPA's 1990 summertime volatility requirements shall be considered summer gasoline. All other gasoline shall be considered winter gasoline, except:
              (2) Gasoline produced or imported for use in Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands that is subject to an approved petition under § 80.93(d)(2) shall be considered summer gasoline for purposes of paragraph (e) of this section.
              (B)(1) Baseline total annual 1990 gasoline volume shall be the larger of the total volume of gasoline produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990.
              (2) Baseline summer gasoline volume shall be the total volume of low volatility gasoline which met EPA's 1990 summertime volatility requirements. Baseline summer gasoline volume shall be determined on the same basis (produced or shipped) as baseline total annual gasoline volume.
              (3) Baseline winter gasoline volume shall be the baseline total annual gasoline volume minus the baseline summer gasoline volume.

              (C) Fuel parameter values shall be determined in the same units and at least to the same number of decimal places as the corresponding fuel parameter listed in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
              (D) Volumes shall be reported to the nearest barrel or to the degree at which historical records were kept.
              (iii) Method 1. Summer and winter Method 1-type data, per paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall be evaluated separately according to the following equation:
              
                ER16FE94.013
              
              
                where:
                
                Xbs = summer or winter baseline value of fuel parameter X for the refinery

(i) The individual baseline volume of a refinery described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be the larger of the total gasoline volume produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990, excluding gasoline blendstocks and exported gasoline, and including the oxygenate volume associated with any product meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) Gasoline brought into the refinery in 1990 which exited the refinery, in 1990, unchanged shall not be included in determining the refinery's baseline volume.
              (iii) If a refiner is allowed to adjust its baseline per paragraphs (e)(5) through (e)(7) of this section, its individual baseline volume shall be the volume determined after the adjustment.
              (iv) The individual baseline volume for facilities deemed closely integrated, per paragraph (e)(1) of this section, shall be the combined 1990 gasoline production of the facilities, so long as mutual volumes are not double-counted, i.e., volumes of blendstock sent from the refinery to the blending facility should not be included in the blending facility's volume.
              (v) The baseline volume of a refiner, per paragraph (b)(3) of this section, shall be the larger of the total gasoline volume produced in or shipped from the refinery in 1990, excluding gasoline blendstocks and exported gasoline.
              (vi) The baseline volume of an importer, per paragraph (b)(4) of this section, shall be the total gasoline volume imported into the U.S. in 1990.
              (2) Individual baseline emissions. (i) Individual annual average baseline emissions (per § 80.90) shall be determined for every refinery, refiner or importer, as applicable.
              (ii) If the baseline fuel value for aromatics, olefins, and/or benzene (determined per paragraph (e) of this section) is higher than the high end of the valid range limits specified in § 80.42(c)(1) if compliance is being determined under the Simple Model, or in § 80.45(f)(1)(ii) if compliance is being determined under the Complex Model, then the valid range limits may be extended for conventional gasoline in the following manner:

              (A) The new high end of the valid range for aromatics is determined from the following equation:
              
              NAROLIM = AROBASE + 5.0 volume percent
              
              
                where
                
                NAROLIM = The new high end of the valid range limit for aromatics, in volume percent
                AROBASE = The seasonal baseline fuel value for aromatics, in volume percent
              
              

              (B) The new high end of the valid range for olefins is determined from the following equation:
              
              NOLELIM = OLEBASE + 3.0 volume percent
              
              
                where
                
                NOLELIM = The new high end of the valid range limit for olefins, in volume percent
                OLEBASE = The seasonal baseline fuel value for olefins, in volume percent
              
              

              (C) The new high end of the valid range for benzene is determined from the following equation:
              
              NBENLIM = BENBASE + 0.5 volume percent
              
              
                where
                
                NBENLIM = The new high end of the valid range limit for benzene, in volume percent
                BENBASE = The seasonal baseline fuel value for benzene, in volume percent
              
              
              (D) The extension of the valid range is limited to the applicable summer or winter season in which the baseline fuel values for aromatics, olefins, and/or benzene exceed the high end of the valid range as described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Also, the extension of the valid range is limited to use by the refiner whose baseline value for aromatics, olefins, and/or benzene was higher than the valid range limits as described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
              (E) Any extension of the Simple Model valid range limits is applicable only to the Simple Model. Likewise any extension of the Complex Model valid range limits is applicable only to the Complex Model.

              (F) The valid range extensions calculated in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section are applicable to both the baseline fuel and target fuel for the purposes of determining the compliance status of conventional gasolines. The extended valid range limit represents the maximum value for that parameter above which fuels cannot be evaluated with the applicable compliance model.
              (G) Under the Simple Model, baseline and compliance calculations shall subscribe to the following limitations:
              (1) If the aromatics valid range has been extended per paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, an aromatics value equal to the high end of the valid range specified in § 80.42(c)(1) shall be used for the purposes of calculating the exhaust benzene fraction.
              (2) If the fuel benzene valid range has been extended per paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a benzene value equal to the high end of the valid range specified in § 80.42(c)(1) shall be used for the purposes of calculating the exhaust benzene fraction.
              (H) Under the Complex Model, baseline and compliance calculations shall subscribe to the following limitations:
              (1) If the aromatics valid range has been extended per paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, an aromatics value equal to the high end of the valid range specified in § 80.45(f)(1)(ii) shall be used for the purposes of calculating emissions performances.
              (2) If the olefins valid range has been extended per paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an olefins value equal to the high end of the valid range specified in § 80.45(f)(1)(ii) shall be used for the target fuel for the purposes of calculating emissions performances.
              (3) If the benzene valid range has been extended per paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a benzene value equal to the high end of the valid range specified in § 80.45(f)(1)(ii) shall be used for the target fuel for the purposes of calculating emissions performances.
              (iii) Facilities deemed closely integrated, per paragraph (e)(1) of this section, shall have a single set of annual average individual baseline emissions.

              (iv) Aggregate baselines (per § 80.101(h)) must have the NOX emissions of all refineries in the aggregate determined on the same basis, using either oxygenated or non-oxygenated baseline fuel parameters.
              (3) Geographic considerations requiring individual conventional gasoline compliance baselines. (i) Anyone may petition EPA to establish separate baselines for refineries located in and providing conventional gasoline to an area with a limited gasoline distribution system if it can show that the area is experiencing increased toxics emissions due to an ozone nonattainment area opting into the reformulated gasoline program pursuant to section 211(k)(6) of the Act.
              (ii) If EPA agrees with the finding of paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, it shall require that the baselines of such refineries be separate from refineries not located in the area.
              (iii) If two (2) or more of a refiner's refineries are located in the geographic area of concern, the refiner may aggregate the baseline emissions and sulfur, olefin and T90 values of the refineries or have an individual baseline for one or more of the refineries, per paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
              (4) Baseline recalculations. Aggregate baseline exhaust emissions (per § 80.90) and baseline sulfur, olefin and T90 values and aggregate baseline volumes shall be recalculated under the following circumstances:
              (i) A refinery included in an aggregate baseline is entirely shutdown. If the shutdown refinery was part of an aggregate baseline, the aggregate baseline emissions, aggregate baseline sulfur, olefin and T90 values and aggregate volume shall be recalculated to account for the removal of the shutdown refinery's contributions to the aggregate baseline.
              (ii) A refinery exchanges owners.
              (A) All aggregate baselines affected by the exchange shall be recalculated to reflect the addition or subtraction of the baseline exhaust emissions, sulfur, olefin and T90 values and volumes of that refinery.
              (B) The new owner may elect to establish an individual baseline for the refinery or to include it in an aggregate baseline.

              (C) If the refinery was part of an aggregate of three or more refineries, the remaining refineries in the aggregate from which that refinery was removed will have a new aggregate baseline. If the refinery was part of an aggregate of only two refineries, the remaining refinery will have an individual baseline.
              (g) Inability to meet the requirements of this section. If a refiner or importer is unable to comply with one or more of the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, it may, upon petition and approval, accommodate the lack of compliance in a reasonable, logical, technically sound manner, considering the appropriateness of the alternative. A narrative of the situation, as well as any calculations and results determined, must be documented.

              § 80.92
              Baseline auditor requirements.
              (a) General requirements. (1) Each refiner or importer is required to have its individual baseline determination methodology, resulting baseline fuel parameter, volume and emissions values verified by an auditor which meets the requirements described in this section. A refiner or importer which has the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline is exempt from this requirement.
              (2) An auditor may be an individual or organization, and may utilize contractors and subcontractors to assist in the verification of a baseline.
              (3) If an auditor is an organization, one or more persons shall be designated as primary analyst(s). The primary analyst(s) shall meet the requirements described in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section and shall be responsible for the baseline audit per paragraph (f) of this section.
              (b) Independence. The auditor, its contractors, subcontractors and their organizations shall be independent of the submitting organization. All of the criteria listed in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section must be met by every individual involved in substantive aspects of the baseline verification.
              (1) Previous employment criteria. (i) None of the auditing personnel, including any contractor or subcontractor personnel, involved in the baseline verification for a refiner or importer shall have been employed by the refiner or importer at any time during the three (3) years preceding the date of hire of the auditor by the refiner or importer for baseline verification purposes.
              (ii) Auditor personnel may have been a contractor or subcontractor to the refiner or importer, as long as all other criteria listed in this section are met.
              (iii) Auditor personnel may also have developed the baseline of the refiner or importer whose baseline they are auditing, but not as an employee (per paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section). Those involved only in the development of the baseline of the refiner or importer need not meet the requirements specified in this section.
              (2) Financial criteria. Neither the primary analyst, nor the auditing organization nor any organization or individual which may be contracted or subcontracted to supply baseline verification expertise shall:
              (i) Have received more than one quarter of its revenue from the refiner or importer during the year prior to the date of hire of the auditor by the refiner or importer for auditing purposes. Income received from the refiner or importer to develop the baseline being audited is excepted; nor
              (ii) Have a total of more than 10 percent of its net worth with the refiner or importer; nor
              (iii) Receive compensation for the audit which is dependent on the outcome of the audit.
              (c) Technical ability. All of the following criteria must be met by the auditor in order to demonstrate its technical capability to perform the baseline audit:
              (1) The auditor shall be technically capable of evaluating a baseline determination. It shall have personnel familiar with petroleum refining processes, including associated computational procedures, methods of product analysis and economics, and expertise in conducting the auditing process, including skills for effective data gathering and analysis.

              (2) The primary analyst must understand all technical details of the entire baseline audit process.
              
              (3)(i) The primary analyst shall have worked at least five (5) years in either refinery operations or as a consultant for the refining industry.
              (ii) If one or more computer models designed for refinery planning and/or economic analysis are used in the verification of an individual baseline, the primary analyst must have at least three (3) years experience working with the model(s) utilized in the verification.
              (iii) EPA may, upon petition, waive one or more of the requirements specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section if the technical capability of the primary analyst is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of Mobile Sources, or designee.
              (d) Auditor qualification statement. A statement documenting the qualifications of the auditor, primary analyst(s), contractors, subcontractors and their organizations must be submitted to EPA (Fuel Studies and Standards Branch, Baseline Auditor, U.S. EPA, 2565 Plymouth Rd., Ann Arbor, MI 48105).
              (1) Timing. (i) The auditor qualification statement may be submitted by the refiner or importer prior to baseline submission (per § 80.93) or by a potential auditor at any time. The auditor will be deemed certified when all qualifications are met, to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office of Mobile Sources, or designee. If no response is received from EPA within 45 days of application or today's date, whichever is later, the auditor shall be deemed certified.
              (ii) The auditor qualification statement may be submitted by the refiner or importer with its baseline submission (per § 80.93). If the auditor does not meet the criteria specified in this section, the baseline submission will not be accepted.
              (2) Content. The auditor qualification statement must contain all of the following information and may contain additional information which may aid EPA's review of the qualification statement:
              (i) The name and address of each person and organization involved in substantive aspects of the baseline audit, including the auditor, primary analyst(s), others within the organization, and contractors and subcontractors;
              (ii) The refiners and/or importers for which the auditor, its contractors and subcontractors and their organizations do not meet the independence criteria described in paragraph (b) of this section; and
              (iii) The technical qualifications and experience of each person involved in the baseline audit, including a showing that the requirements described in paragraph (c) of this section are met.
              (e) Refiner and importer responsibility. (1) Each refiner and importer required to have its baseline verified by an auditor (per paragraph (a)(1) of this section) is responsible for utilizing an auditor for baseline verification which meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
              (2) A refiner's or importer's baseline submission will not be accepted until it has been verified using an auditor which meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
              (f) Auditor responsibilities. (1) The auditor must verify that all baseline submission requirements are fulfilled. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
              (i) Verifying that all data is correctly accounted for;
              (ii) Verifying that all calculations are performed correctly;
              (iii) Verifying that all adjustments to the data and/or calculations to account for post-1990 data, work-in-progress, and/or extenuating or other circumstances, as allowed per § 80.91, are valid and performed correctly.
              (2) The primary analyst shall prepare and sign a statement, to be included in the baseline submission of the refiner or importer, stating that:
              (i) He/she has thoroughly reviewed the sampling methodology and baseline calculations; and
              (ii) To the best of his/her knowledge, the requirements and intentions of the rulemaking are met in the baseline determination; and
              (iii) He/she agrees with the final baseline parameter, volume and emission values listed in the baseline submission.

              (3) The auditor may be subject to debarment under U.S.C. 1001 if it displays gross incompetency, intentionally commits an error in the verification process or misrepresents itself or information in the baseline verification.

              Individual baseline submission and approval.
              (a) Submission timing. (1) Each refiner, blender or importer shall submit two copies of its individual baseline to EPA (Fuel Studies and Standards Branch, Baseline Submission, U.S. EPA, 2565 Plymouth Rd., Ann Arbor, MI 48105) not later than June 1, 1994.
              (2) If a refiner must collect data after December 15, 1993 (per § 80.91(d)(2)), it shall submit two copies of its individual baseline to EPA (per § 80.93(a)(1)) by September 1, 1994.
              (3)(i) All petitions required for baseline adjustments or methodology deviations will be approved or disapproved by the Director of the Office of Mobile Sources, or designee. All instances where a “showing” or other proof is required are also subject to approval by the Director of the Office of Mobile Sources, or designee.
              (ii) Petitions, “showings,” and other associated proof may be submitted to EPA prior to submittal of the individual baseline (per paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section). EPA will attempt to review and approve, disapprove or otherwise comment on the petition, etc., prior to the deadline for baseline submittal.
              (iii) In the event that EPA does not comment on the petition prior to the deadline for baseline submittal, the refiner or importer must still comply with the applicable baseline submittal deadline.
              (iv) Petitions submitted prior to the deadline for baseline submittals shall be submitted to the EPA at the following address: Fuels Studies and Standards Branch, Baseline Petition, U.S. EPA, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.
              (4) If a baseline recalculation is required per § 80.91(f), documentation and recalculation of all affected baselines shall be submitted to EPA within 30 days of the previous baseline(s) becoming inaccurate due to the circumstances outlined in § 80.91(f).

              (E) The requirements and intentions of the rulemaking have been met in determining the baseline fuel parameters; and
              (F) The baseline fuel parameter values determined for each facility represent that facility's 1990 gasoline to the fullest extent possible.

              (ii) A refiner or importer which is permitted to utilize the parameter values specified in § 80.91(c)(5), and does so, shall submit a statement signed by the chief executive officer of the company, or designee, indicating that insufficient data exist for a baseline determination by the types of data allowed for that entity, as specified in § 80.91.
              (4) The auditor-related requirements are:
              (i) Name, address, telephone number and date of hire of each auditor hired for baseline verification, whether or not the auditor was retained through the baseline approval process.
              (ii) Identification of the auditor responsible for the verification. A copy of this auditor's qualification statement, per § 80.92, must be included if the auditor has not been approved by EPA, per § 80.92;

              § 80.94
              Requirements for gasoline produced at foreign refineries.
              (a) Definitions. (1) A foreign refinery is a refinery that is located outside the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively referred to in this section as “the United States”).
              (2) A foreign refiner is a person who meets the definition of refiner under § 80.2(i) for foreign refinery.
              (3) FRGAS means gasoline produced at a foreign refinery that has been assigned an individual refinery baseline and that is imported into the United States.
              (4) Non-FRGAS means gasoline that is produced at a foreign refinery that has not been assigned an individual refinery baseline, gasoline produced at a foreign refinery with an individual refinery baseline that is not imported into the United States, and gasoline produced at a foreign refinery with an individual baseline during a year when the foreign refiner has opted to not participate in the FRGAS program under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (5) Certified FRGAS means FRGAS the foreign refiner intends to include in the foreign refinery's NOX and exhaust toxics compliance calculations under § 80.101(g), and does include in these compliance calculations when reported to EPA.
              (6) Non-certified FRGAS means FRGAS that is not certified FRGAS.
              (b) Baseline establishment. Any foreign refiner may submit to EPA a petition for an individual refinery baseline, under §§ 80.90 through 80.93.
              (1) The provisions for baselines as specified in §§ 80.90 through 80.93 shall apply to a foreign refinery, except where provided otherwise in this section.
              (2) The baseline for a foreign refinery shall reflect only the volume and properties of gasoline produced in 1990 that was imported into the United States.
              (3) A baseline petition shall establish the volume of conventional gasoline produced at a foreign refinery and imported into the United States during the calendar year immediately preceding the year the baseline petition is submitted.
              (4) In making determinations for foreign refinery baselines EPA will consider all information supplied by a foreign refiner, and in addition may rely on any and all appropriate assumptions necessary to make such a determination.
              (5) Where a foreign refiner submits a petition that is incomplete or inadequate to establish an accurate baseline, and the refiner fails to cure this defect after a request for more information, then EPA shall not assign an individual refinery baseline.
              (6) Baseline petitions under this paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted before January 1, 2002.
              (c) General requirements for foreign refiners with individual refinery baselines. Any foreign refiner of a refinery that has been assigned an individual baseline under paragraph (b) of this section shall designate all gasoline produced at the foreign refinery that is exported to the United States as either certified FRGAS or as non-certified FRGAS, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (1)(i) In the case of certified FRGAS, the foreign refiner shall meet all requirements that apply to refiners under 40 CFR part 80, subparts D, E and F.

              (ii) If the foreign refinery baseline is assigned, or a foreign refiner begins early use of a refinery baseline under paragraph (r) of this section, on a date other than January 1, the compliance baseline for the initial year shall be calculated under § 80.101(f) using an adjusted baseline volume, as follows:
              
              AV1990 = (D/365) × V1990
              
              
              
                where:
                
                AV1990 = Adjusted 1990 baseline volume
                D = Number of days remaining in the year, beginning with the day the foreign refinery baseline is approved or the day the foreign refiner begins early use of a refinery baseline, whichever is later
                V1990 = Foreign refinery's 1990 baseline volume.
              
              
              (2) In the case of non-certified FRGAS, the foreign refiner shall meet the following requirements, except the foreign refiner shall substitute the name “non-certified FRGAS” for the names “reformulated gasoline” or “RBOB” wherever they appear in the following requirements:

              (2) No foreign refiner or other person may cause another person to commit an action prohibited in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, or that otherwise violates the requirements of this section.
              (o) United States importer requirements. Any United States importer shall meet the following requirements.
              (1) Each batch of imported gasoline shall be classified by the importer as being FRGAS or as non-FRGAS, and each batch classified as FRGAS shall be further classified as certified FRGAS or as non-certified FRGAS.
              (2) Gasoline shall be classified as certified FRGAS or as non-certified FRGAS according to the designation by the foreign refiner if this designation is supported by product transfer documents prepared by the foreign refiner as required in paragraph (d) of this section, unless the gasoline is classified as non-certified FRGAS under paragraph (g) of this section.
              (3) For each gasoline batch classified as FRGAS, any United States importer shall perform the following procedures.
              (i) In the case of both certified and non-certified FRGAS, have an independent third party:
              (A) Determine the volume of gasoline in the vessel;

              (B) Use the foreign refiner's FRGAS certification to determine the name and EPA-assigned registration number of the foreign refinery that produced the FRGAS;
              (C) Determine the name and country of registration of the vessel used to transport the FRGAS to the United States; and
              (D) Determine the date and time the vessel arrives at the United States port of entry.
              (ii) In the case of certified FRGAS, have an independent third party:
              (A) Collect a representative sample from each vessel compartment subsequent to the vessel's arrival at the United States port of entry and prior to off loading any gasoline from the vessel;
              (B) Prepare a volume-weighted vessel composite sample from the compartment samples; and
              (C) Determine the values for sulfur, benzene, gravity, E200 and E300 using the methodologies specified in § 80.46, by:
              (1) The third party analyzing the sample; or
              (2) The third party observing the importer analyze the sample
              (4) Any importer shall submit reports within thirty days following the date any vessel transporting FRGAS arrives at the United States port of entry:
              (i) To the Administrator containing the information determined under paragraph (o)(3) of this section; and
              (ii) To the foreign refiner containing the information determined under paragraph (o)(3)(ii) of this section.
              (5)(i) Any United States importer shall meet the requirements specified for conventional gasoline in § 80.101 for any imported conventional gasoline that is not classified as certified FRGAS under paragraph (o)(2) of this section.
              (ii) The baseline applicable to a United States importer who has not been assigned an individual importer baseline under § 80.91(b)(4) shall be the baseline specified in paragraph (p) of this section.
              (p) Importer Baseline. (1) Each calendar year starting in 2000, the Administrator shall calculate the volume weighted average NOX emissions of imported conventional gasoline for a multi-year period (MYANOx). This calculation:
              (i) Shall use the Phase II Complex Model;
              (ii) Shall include all conventional gasoline in the following categories:
              (A) Imported conventional gasoline that is classified as conventional gasoline, and included in the conventional gasoline compliance calculations of importers for each year; and
              (B) Imported conventional gasoline that is classified as certified FRGAS, and included in the conventional gasoline compliance calculations of foreign refiners for each year;
              (iii)(A) In 2000 only, shall be for the 1998 and 1999 averaging periods and also shall include all conventional gasoline classified as FRGAS and included in the conventional gasoline compliance calculations of a foreign refiner for 1997, and all conventional gasoline batches not classified as FRGAS that are imported during 1997 beginning on the date the first batch of FRGAS arrives at a United States port of entry; and
              (B) Starting in 2001, shall include imported conventional gasoline during the prior three calendar year averaging periods.
              (2)(i) If the volume-weighted average NOX emissions (MYANOx), calculated in paragraph (p)(1) of this section, is greater than 1,465 mg/mile, the Administrator shall calculate an adjusted baseline for NOX according to the following equation:
              
              ABNOx = 1,465 mg/mile − (MYANOx − 1,465 mg/mile)
              
              
                where:
                
                ABNOx = Adjusted NOX baseline, in mg/mile
                MYANOx = Multi-year average NOX emissions, in mg/mile
              
              

              (ii) For the 1998 and 1999 multi-year averaging period only the value of ABNOx shall not be larger than 1,480 mg/mile regardless of the calculation under paragraph (p)(2)(i) of this section.

              (3)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 80.91(b)(4)(iii), the baseline NOX emissions values applicable to any United States importer who has not been assigned an individual importer baseline under § 80.91(b)(4) shall be the more stringent of the statutory baseline value for NOX under § 80.91(c)(5), or the adjusted NOX baseline calculated in paragraph (p)(2) of this section.

              (ii) On or before June 1 of each calendar year, the Administrator shall announce the NOX baseline that applies to importers under this paragraph (p). If the baseline is an adjusted baseline, it shall be effective for any conventional gasoline imported beginning 60 days following the Administrator's announcement. If the baseline is the statutory baseline, it shall be effective upon announcement. A baseline shall remain in effect until the effective date of a subsequent change to the baseline pursuant to this paragraph (p).
              (q) Withdrawal or suspension of a foreign refinery's baseline. EPA may withdraw or suspend a baseline that has been assigned to a foreign refinery where:
              (1) A foreign refiner fails to meet any requirement of this section;
              (2) A foreign government fails to allow EPA inspections as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section;
              (3) A foreign refiner asserts a claim of, or a right to claim, sovereign immunity in an action to enforce the requirements in 40 CFR part 80, subparts D, E and F; or
              (4) A foreign refiner fails to pay a civil or criminal penalty that is not satisfied using the foreign refiner bond specified in paragraph (k) of this section.
              (r) Early use of a foreign refinery baseline. (1) A foreign refiner may begin using an individual refinery baseline before EPA has approved the baseline, provided that:
              (i) A baseline petition has been submitted as required in paragraph (b) of this section;
              (ii) EPA has made a provisional finding that the baseline petition is complete;
              (iii) The foreign refiner has made the commitments required in paragraph (i) of this section;

              (3) Complex model standards. (i) Annual average levels of exhaust toxics emissions and NOX emissions, weighted by volume for each batch and calculated using the applicable complex model under § 80.45, shall not exceed the refiner's or importer's compliance baseline for exhaust toxics and NOX emissions, respectively.
              (ii) Annual average levels of RVP, benzene, aromatics, olefins, sulfur, E200 and E300 shall not be greater than the conventional gasoline complex model valid range limits for the parameter under § 80.45(f)(1)(ii), or the refiner or importer's annual 1990 baseline for the parameter if outside the valid range limit, whichever is greater.
              (c) Applicability of standards. (1) For each averaging period prior to January 1, 1998, a refiner or importer shall be subject to either the Simple Model or Optional Complex Model Standards, at their option, except that any refiner or importer shall be subject to:
              (i) The Simple Model Standards if the refiner or importer uses the Simple Model Standards for reformulated gasoline; or
              (ii) The Optional Complex Model Standards if the refiner or importer used the Complex Model Standards for reformulated gasoline.
              (2) Beginning January 1, 1998, each refiner and importer shall be subject to the Complex Model Standards for each averaging period.
              (3)(i) The NOX emissions standard specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall no longer apply beginning January 1, 2007, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.

              (ii) For a refiner subject to the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards at § 80.240, the NOX emissions standard specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall no longer apply beginning January 1, 2008. For a refiner subject to the gasoline sulfur standards at § 80.240 that has received an extension of its small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.553, the NOX emissions standard specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall no longer apply beginning January 1, 2011.
              (4)(i) Beginning January 1, 2011, or January 1, 2015 for small refiners approved under § 80.1340, the exhaust toxics emissions standard specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall apply only to conventional gasoline that is not subject to the benzene standard of § 80.1230, pursuant to the provisions of § 80.1235.

              (ii) The exhaust toxic emissions standard specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply to conventional gasoline produced by a refinery approved under § 80.1334, pursuant to § 80.1334(c).

              (1) Any conventional gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period;
              (2) [Reserved]
              (3) Any gasoline blending stock produced or imported during the averaging period which becomes conventional gasoline solely upon the addition of oxygenate;
              (4)(i) Any oxygenate that is added to conventional gasoline, or gasoline blending stock as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, where such gasoline or gasoline blending stock is produced or imported during the averaging period;
              (ii) In the case of oxygenate that is added at a point downstream of the refinery or import facility, the oxygenate may be included only if the refiner or importer can establish the oxygenate was in fact added to the gasoline or gasoline blendstock produced, by showing that the oxygenate was added by:
              (A) The refiner or importer; or
              (B) By a person other than the refiner or importer, provided that the refiner or importer:
              (1) Has a contract with the oxygenate blender that specifies procedures to be followed by the oxygenate blender that are reasonably calculated to ensure blending with the amount and type of oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer; and
              (2) Monitors the oxygenate blending operation to ensure the volume and type of oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer is correct, through periodic audits of the oxygenate blender designed to assess whether the overall volumes and type of oxygenate purchased and used by the oxygenate blender are consistent with the oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer and that this oxygenate was blended with the refiner's or importer's gasoline or blending stock, periodic sampling and testing of the gasoline produced subsequent to oxygenate blending, and periodic inspections to ensure the contractual requirements imposed by the refiner or importer on the oxygenate blender are being met.
              (e) Product to which standards do not apply. Any refiner for each refinery, or any importer, shall exclude from its compliance calculations:
              (1) Gasoline that was not produced at the refinery or was not imported by the importer;

                EEPj = equivalent emissions performance of the blendstock for emissions performance j
                BEPj = emissions performance j of a gasoline having the properties of the refinery's baseline

              (6)(i) The emissions performance of gasoline that has an RVP greater than the RVP required under § 80.27 (“winter gasoline”) shall be determined using the applicable winter complex model under § 80.45, using an RVP of 8.7 psi for compliance calculation purposes under this subpart E.
              (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, the emissions performance of gasoline produced or imported for use in areas that are not subject to the requirements of § 80.27 shall be determined using the applicable winter complex model under § 80.45, using an RVP of 8.7 psi for compliance calculation purposes under this subpart E.

              (7)(i) For the 1998 averaging period any refiner or importer may elect to determine compliance with the requirement for exhaust NOX emissions performance either with or without the inclusion of oxygenates in its compliance calculations, in accordance with § 80.91(e)(4), provided that the baseline exhaust NOX emissions performance is calculated using the same with- or without-oxygen approach.
              (ii)(A) Any refiner or importer must use the with- or without-oxygen approach elected under paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section for all subsequent averaging periods; except that
              (B) In the case of any refiner or importer who elects to determines compliance for the calendar year 1998 averaging period without the inclusion of oxygenates, such refiner or importer may elect to include oxygenates in its compliance calculations for the 1999 averaging period.
              (iii) Any refiner or importer who elects to use the with-oxygen approach under paragraph (g)(7)(ii)(B) of this section must use this approach for all subsequent averaging periods.
              (8) Emissions performance of conventional gasoline with parameters outside the complex model valid range limits. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 80.45(f)(2), in the case of any parameter value that does not fall within the complex model range limit in § 80.45(f)(1)(ii), the refiner or importer shall determine the emissions performance of the batch using the following parameter values:

              (9) Exclusion of previously certified gasoline. (i) Any refiner who uses previously certified reformulated or conventional gasoline or RBOB to produce conventional gasoline at a refinery, must exclude the previously certified gasoline for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the standards under paragraph (b) of this section.
              (ii) To accomplish the exclusion required in paragraph (g)(9)(i) of this section, the refiner must determine the volume and properties of the previously certified gasoline used at the refinery, and the volume and properties of gasoline produced at the refinery, and use the compliance calculation procedures in paragraphs (g)(9)(iii) and (g)(9)(iv) of this section.
              (iii) For each batch of previously certified gasoline that is used to produce conventional gasoline the refiner must:
              (A) Determine the volume and properties using the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section;
              (B) Determine the exhaust toxics and NOX emissions performance using the summer or winter complex model as appropriate;

              (C) Include the volume and emissions performance of the previously certified gasoline as a negative volume and a negative emissions performance in the refiner's compliance calculations for the refinery, or where applicable, the refiner's aggregation under paragraph (h) of this section, for exhaust toxics and NOX.

              (iv) For each batch of conventional gasoline produced at the refinery using previously certified gasoline, the refiner must determine the volume and properties, and exhaust toxics and NOX emissions performance, and include each batch in the refinery's compliance calculations for exhaust toxics and NOX without regard to the presence of previously certified gasoline in the batch.
              (v) The refiner must use any previously certified gasoline that the refiner includes as a negative batch in its compliance calculations for the refinery, or where appropriate, the refiner's aggregation, as a component in gasoline production during the annual averaging period in which the previously certified gasoline was included as a negative batch in the refiner's compliance calculations.

              (vi) Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (g)(9), the provisions of paragraph (g)(3) of this section may be used to calculate the exhaust toxics and NOX emissions performance of a blendstock added to conventional gasoline for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the standards under paragraph (b) of this section.
              (h) Refinery grouping for determining compliance. (1) Any refiner that operates more than one refinery may:
              (i) Elect to achieve compliance individually for the refineries; or
              (ii) Elect to achieve compliance on an aggregate basis for a group, or for groups, of refineries, some of which may be individual refineries; provided that
              (iii) Compliance is achieved for each refinery separately or as part of a group; and
              (iv) The data for any refinery is included only in one compliance calculation.
              (2) Any election by a refiner to group refineries under paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall:
              (i) Be made as part of the report for the 1995 averaging period required by § 80.105; and
              (ii) Apply for the 1995 averaging period and for each subsequent averaging period, and may not thereafter be changed.
              (3)(i) Any standards under this section shall apply, and compliance calculations shall be made, separately for each refinery or refinery group; except that

              (ii) Any refiner that produces conventional gasoline for distribution to a specified geographic area which is the subject of a petition approved by EPA pursuant to § 80.91(f)(3) shall achieve compliance separately for gasoline supplied to such specified geographic area.
              (i) Sampling and testing. (1) Any refiner or importer shall for each batch of conventional gasoline, and other products if included in paragraph (d) of this section:
              (i)(A) Through December 31, 2015, determine the value of each of the properties required for determining compliance with the standards that are applicable to the refiner or importer, by collecting and analyzing a representative sample of gasoline or blendstock from the batch, using methodologies specified in § 80.46; beginning January 1, 2016, determine the value of each of the properties required for determining compliance with the standards that are applicable to the refiner or importer, by collecting and analyzing a representative sample of gasoline or blendstock from the batch, using methodologies specified in § 80.47; except that—
              (B) Any refiner that produces gasoline by combining blendstock with gasoline that has been included in the compliance calculations of another refiner or of an importer may for such gasoline meet this sampling and testing requirement by collecting and analyzing a representative sample of the blendstock used subsequent to each receipt of such blendstock if the compliance calculation method specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section is used.
              (ii) Assign a number to the batch (the “batch number”), as specified in § 80.65(d)(3);
              (2) For the purposes of meeting the sampling and testing requirements under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, any refiner or importer may, prior to analysis, combine samples of gasoline collected from more than one batch of gasoline or blendstock (“composite sample”), and treat such composite sample as one batch of gasoline or blendstock provided that the refiner or importer:
              (i) Meets each of the requirements specified in § 80.91(d)(4)(iii) for the samples contained in the composite sample;
              (ii) Combines samples of gasoline that are produced or imported over a period no longer than one month;
              (iii) Uses the total of the volumes of the batches of gasoline that comprise the composite sample, and the results of the analyses of the composite sample, for purposes of compliance calculations under paragraph (g) of this section; and
              (iv) Does not combine summer and winter gasoline, as specified under paragraphs (g) (5) and (6) of this section, in a composite sample.
              (3) An importer who imports conventional gasoline into the United States by truck may meet the sampling and testing requirements under paragraph (i)(1) of this section as follows:
              (i)(A) The importer must demonstrate that the imported gasoline meets the applicable conventional gasoline standards, through test results of samples of the gasoline contained in the storage tank from which the trucks used to transport gasoline into the United States are loaded.
              (B) The frequency of this sampling and testing must be subsequent to each receipt of gasoline into the storage tank, or immediately prior to each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck.
              (C) The testing must be for each applicable parameter specified under § 80.65(e)(2)(i), using the test methods specified under § 80.46 through December 31, 2015, or under § 80.47 beginning January 1, 2016.
              (D) The importer must obtain a copy of the terminal test results that reflects the quality of each truck load of gasoline that is imported into the United States.
              (ii)(A) The importer must conduct separate programs of periodic quality assurance sampling and testing of the gasoline obtained from each truck-loading terminal, to ensure the accuracy of the terminal test results.
              (B) The quality assurance samples must be obtained from the truck-loading terminal by the importer, and terminal operator may not know in advance when samples are to be collected.

              (C) The testing must be for each applicable parameter specified under § 80.65(e)(2)(i), using the test methods specified under § 80.46 through December 31, 2015, or under § 80.47 beginning January 1, 2016.
              
              (D) The frequency of quality assurance sampling and testing must be at least one sample for each fifty of an importer's trucks that are loaded at a terminal, or one sample per month, whichever is more frequent.
              (iii) The requirements of paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section are satisfied if the sampling and testing required under paragraph (i)(3)(i) is conducted by a laboratory that is an independent laboratory under the criteria of § 80.82(b)(2).
              (iv) The importer must treat each truck load of imported gasoline as a separate batch for purposes of assigning batch numbers under § 80.101(i), recordkeeping under § 80.104, and reporting under § 80.105.
              (v) EPA inspectors or auditors, and auditors conducting attest engagements under subpart F, must be given full and immediate access to the truck-loading terminal and any laboratory at which samples of gasoline collected at the terminal are analyzed, and be allowed to conduct inspections, review records, collect gasoline samples, and perform audits. These inspections or audits may be either announced or unannounced.
              (vi) In the event the requirements specified in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) through (v) of this section are not met, in whole or in part, the importer shall immediately lose the option of importing gasoline under the terms of this paragraph (i)(3).
              (j) Evasion of standards through exporting and importing gasoline. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, no refiner or importer shall export gasoline and import the same or other gasoline for the purpose of evading a more stringent baseline requirement.
              (k) Petitions for an alternative anti-dumping averaging period—(1) Eligibility for petition. (i) The Administrator may grant an averaging period of two, three, four or five years upon petition of a refiner who:

              (ii)(A) By the end of the applicable alternative averaging period, the refinery must generate a net NOX benefit (compared to the statutory baseline) that is at least twice as large as the total NOX deficit generated during the period of time during which the refiner produced gasoline that did not comply with the statutory baseline.
              (B) At least one-half of the total NOX benefit required under paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section must be generated by production of conventional gasoline at the refinery that is cleaner than the statutory baseline NOX standard, as calculated on a quarterly basis in accordance with the provision of this paragraph (k)(3)(ii).
              (C) Any portion of the total NOX benefit beyond that portion described under paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(B) of this section may come from either the production of conventional gasoline at the refinery that is cleaner than the statutory baseline NOX standard, as calculated on a quarterly basis, or from the purchase and retirement of stationary source NOX credits or allowances, as provided in paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section.
              

              (D) For the purposes of this § 80.101(k) and § 80.101(l), the NOX deficit in tons shall be calculated in accordance with the following equation:
              
              NOXDef = (NOXad − NOXsea)* Gd*2.7 × 10−8
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                NOXDef = the NOX deficit, in tons, for a calendar quarter in which the refiner's NOX performance for that quarter exceeds NOXsea.
                NOXad = the average volume weighted NOX emissions performance, in mg/mile, for a calendar quarter in which the refiner exceeds NOXsea.
                NOXsea = quarterly statutory NOX performance values. First calendar quarter = 1540 mg/mile; Second calendar quarter = 1383 mg/mile; Third calendar quarter = 1381 mg/mile; Fourth calendar quarter = 1540 mg/mile.
                Gd = the volume of gasoline produced during a quarter in which the refiner exceeds the applicable NOX standard, measured in gallons.
              
              

              (E) For the purposes of this § 80.101(k) and § 80.101(l), the NOX benefit in tons shall be calculated in accordance with the following equation:
              
              NOXBen (NOXsea—NOXab)*Gd*2.7 × 10−8
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                NOxBen = the NOX benefit, in tons, for a calendar quarter in which the refiner's NOX performance for that quarter is below NOXsea.
                NOXab = the average volume weighted NOX emissions performance, in mg/mile, for a calendar quarter in which the refiner is below NOXsea.
                NOXsea = quarterly statutory NOX performance values. First calendar quarter = 1540 mg/mile; Second calendar quarter = 1383 mg/mile; Third calendar quarter = 1381 mg/mile; Fourth calendar quarter = 1540 mg/mile.
                Gb = the volume of gasoline produced during a quarter in which the refiner is below the applicable NOX standard, measured in gallons.
              
              
              (iii) NOX Credits and Allowances. (A) Within 60 days of the end of each quarter for which the refinery produces gasoline for which there is a NOX deficit, the refiner shall purchase stationary source NOX credits or allowances that are equal to or greater than the amount of the NOX deficit generated during the quarter, and provide written demonstration of such transaction to the Administrator. These NOX credits or allowances are in addition to any NOX credits or allowances purchased during any previous quarters. NOX deficit is to be calculated on a quarterly basis in accordance with the equation in paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(D) of this section.
              (B) No NOX credits or allowances purchased by the refiner may contribute to the refinery's compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (k)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
              (C) The refinery may sell NOX credits or allowances purchased under this paragraph (k)(3)(iii) only in an amount equal to or less than any NOX benefit that the refinery generates subsequently through the production of conventional gasoline at the refinery that is cleaner than the statutory baseline NOX standard, as calculated on a quarterly basis. A refiner may retire credits or allowances purchased under this paragraph (k)(3)(iii) at any time.

              (D) For purposes of satisfying a refinery's obligations under paragraphs (k)(3)(ii)(C), (k)(3)(iii)(A) or (l)(6)(ii) of this section, any NOX credits or allowances that a refiner purchases must have been validly generated as part of a state stationary source program covered by an approved state implementation plan (SIP) and must be current and marketable NOX credits or allowances. It shall be the refiner's responsibility to ensure that NOX credits or allowances are valid, current and marketable.
              (E) In order to be retired, NOX allowances or credits must be retired by EPA or the administering state agency, as provided for in the applicable state implementation plan (SIP). It shall be the refiner's responsibility to ensure that NOX credits or allowances are actually retired and that retirement is reflected in the records of EPA or the administering state agency.

              (iv) (A) The refinery shall not generate marketable credits or allotments under the Tier 2 gasoline program provisions of Subpart H of this part during the entire alternative averaging period and shall provide a written statement, on a quarterly basis, certifying that the refinery has not generated, produced, sold, or transferred any such marketable credits or allotments under Subpart H of this part.
              
              (B) If the final quarter of the alternative averaging period ends on a date other than December 31, then the refiner may generate credits for that portion of the year that was not subject to the alternative averaging period.
              (v) The refinery shall market any conventional gasoline it produces that is subject to the requirements of § 80.27 as 9.0 RVP gasoline until the standard in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section is met.
              (vi) A refinery that has been granted an averaging period under this section must submit the following reports to the Administrator within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter:
              (A) Quarterly batch reports and anti-dumping averaging reports for gasoline produced during each quarter; and
              (B)(1) Documents that demonstrate compliance with the requirements under paragraph (k)(3)(iii) and (k)(3)(iv) of this section. including a calculation of the NOX deficit or benefit for that quarter and a current total, based upon all quarters, indicating the current NOX deficit or NOX benefit balance for the refinery; and
              (2) A statement of the number of NOX credits or allowances purchased, sold or retired during the quarter and a current total, based upon all quarters, indicating the current balance of NOX credits or allowances; and

              (3) Any contractual documents, or other documents, evidencing the purchasing, banking or retiring of NOX credits or allowances.

              (vii) The Administrator may specify, as part of the approved petition, deadlines by which a refiner is obligated to take certain actions (including those listed in paragraph (k)(2)(viii) of this section) demonstrating reasonable progress toward completion of the refinery changes necessary to produce gasoline that will allow the refinery to comply with the overall alternative averaging period NOX standard.

              (viii)(A) The refiner shall submit reports demonstrating compliance with deadline requirements under paragraph (k)(3)(vii) of this section no later than 30 days after the applicable deadline occurs. Upon failure to meet a deadline requirement under paragraph (k)(3)(vii) of this section, the Administrator may accelerate the date by which the refiner would have to produce gasoline that complies with the annual average statutory baseline NOX standard under paragraph (k)(3)(i) or (l)(6)(i) of this section such that the gasoline produced by the refinery beginning with the quarter immediately following the quarter during which the failure occurred (and during each subsequent quarter) would have to meet that standard. The acceleration of the requirement under paragraph (k)(3)(i) or (l)(6)(i) of this section, regarding compliance with the annual average statutory baseline NOX standard, does not affect the applicability of any other standard or requirement applicable to the refinery under this or any other section of the Act (e.g., the refinery must still comply with the overall alternative averaging period NOX requirements in paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section).
              (B) The reports required by this paragraph shall be on forms and following procedures specified by the Administrator of the EPA and signed and certified as correct by the owner or a responsible corporate officer of the refiner.
              (ix) The refiner shall comply with any condition or requirement prescribed by the Administrator as part of the petition approval.

              (x) The refinery must comply with all standards in this paragraph and with all applicable anti-dumping standards in Subpart E of this section, except the NOX standard.
              (4) Approval or disapproval of petitions. The Administrator will approve or disapprove the petition within six months of receipt, in writing, and in the case of an approval will include any conditions or requirements to which the approval is subject.
              (5) Effective date for alternative averaging period. (i) For an approved petition, the alternative averaging period shall become effective with the first day of the next calendar quarter, unless the first day of a later calendar quarter is requested.

              (ii) If the final quarter of the alternative averaging period ends on a date other than December 31, then the refiner must demonstrate compliance with anti-dumping standards for gasoline produced during the remainder of that year and must demonstrate such compliance via the annual report as specified in § 80.105.
              (6) Refinery request for a change in alternative averaging period. At any point during the pendency of an alternative conventional gasoline anti-dumping compliance period the Administrator may, upon application by a refiner, approve a different alternative compliance period for a refinery already operating subject to an alternative compliance period. In any such case:
              (i) A refinery for which a change in the applicable alternative compliance period is approved shall thereafter operate as if the refinery had originally requested and received such alternative compliance period, and shall be subject to the standards and other requirements applicable under such alternative compliance period.
              (ii) The Administrator will approve or disapprove any application for a different alternative compliance period, in writing, within six months of receipt, and in the case of an approval will include any conditions or other requirements to which the approval is subject;
              (iii) Accept as specifically modified by this section, such refinery must continue to comply with all other standards and other requirements applicable under the conventional gasoline anti-dumping standards; and
              (iv) No application may result in an alternative compliance period that extends beyond January 1, 2006, except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section.
              (7) Violations under this paragraph (k). Any person who fails to meet a standard or other requirement under this paragraph (k) shall be liable for penalties under § 80.5. Additionally, in the event that the refiner fails to achieve the required NOX benefit calculated under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, any NOX credits still banked under paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section shall be forfeit.
              (l) Special alternative anti-dumping averaging period provisions for small refineries—(1) Eligibility for petition. A refiner who has been granted small refiner status under § 80.235 and who meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (k)(1) of this section may petition for an alternative compliance period that is greater than five years and/or that extends beyond January 1, 2006, provided that such application is submitted by January 1, 2004. No application under this paragraph (l) may result in an alternative compliance period that extends beyond January 1, 2008.
              (2) Application process. Applications must be submitted to the Administrator by January 1, 2004, to the following address: U.S. EPA—Attn: Anti-Dumping Compliance Period (6406J), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20460 (certified mail/return receipt) or U.S. EPA—Attn: Anti-Dumping Compliance Period (6406J), Transportation & Regional Programs Division, 501 3rd Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 (express mail/return receipt).
              (3) Contents of the application petition. Each petition must include:
              (i) The information and signed statements specified for all petitioners under § 80.101(k)(2);
              (ii) A description of the hardships that make it infeasible, on a cost and/or technological basis, for the refinery to comply with an alternative anti-dumping compliance baseline of five years or less, or that ends on or before January 1, 2006.

              (iii) A quarterly timeline, from the date of the application, indicating the expected NOX emissions performance of the refinery's conventional gasoline, and the reasons for any expected non-compliance with the statutory baseline standard for NOX on a quarterly basis (for example, a particular gasoline blendstock-producing unit not yet installed). The timeline shall include the date by which the refinery will produce conventional gasoline that complies with the annual average statutory NOX baseline on a quarterly basis as determined according to § 80.101(k)(3)(ii).
              (iv) A demonstration that the conditions for which the refinery was granted small refiner status under § 80.235 are still applicable.
              (v) Information already submitted to the Administrator as part of a prior petition under paragraph (k) of this section, shall be updated if applicable.

              (4) Approval or disapproval of petitions. The Administrator may approve a petition under this paragraph (l) if it includes information sufficient to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that cost and/or technological constraints make it infeasible for the refinery to comply with an alternative anti-dumping compliance baseline of five years or less, or that ends on or before January 1, 2006. The Administrator will approve or deny the petition in writing within six months of receipt. An approval will include any conditions or requirements to which the approval is subject.
              (5) Cessation of extended alternative compliance period. (i) Refineries that qualify as small under § 80.223, and that later are disqualified under § 80.230(b), will be subject to the statutory anti-dumping baseline on an annual average basis beginning the calendar year immediately following the refinery's change in status.
              (ii) If the Administrator finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information on its application for small refiner status, upon notice from the Administrator, the refiner's extended alternative compliance period will be void ab initio.
              (6) Compliance requirements for qualifying small refiners. (i) If the refiner's application for an extended compliance period under this paragraph (l) is approved, then the refinery must comply with the statutory baseline NOX standard, on average, for gasoline produced beginning by not later than the 19th quarter (for a six year compliance period) or by no later than the 22nd quarter (for a seven year compliance period).

              (ii) The refinery must meet all other applicable requirements in paragraph (k) of this section, including the production of a net NOX benefit under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, except that the following provisions shall apply:
              (A) For any cumulative NOX deficit remaining at the expiration of the fifth year, based on the NOX emission performance of gasoline actually produced at the refinery, and as calculated under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, the refiner shall provide an additional NOX benefit equal to one half ton of NOX emissions per ton of deficit remaining by the end of the refinery's alternative anti-dumping averaging period.
              (B) For any cumulative NOX deficit remaining at the expiration of the sixth year, based on the NOX emission performance of gasoline actually produced at the refinery, and as calculated under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, the refiner shall provide an additional NOX benefit equal to one ton of NOX emissions per ton of deficit remaining by the end of the refinery's alternative anti-dumping averaging period.
              (C) The additional NOX benefits required under this paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section may come from the production of gasoline at the refinery that is cleaner than the statutory baseline or from the purchase and retirement of stationary source NOX credits or allowances as provided in paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section.

              § 80.126
              Definitions.
              The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this subpart F:
              (a) Averaging compliance records shall include the calculations used to determine compliance with relevant standards on average, for each averaging period and for each quantity of gasoline for which standards must be achieved separately.
              (b) Credit Trading Records. Credit trading records shall include worksheets and EPA reports showing actual and complying totals for benzene; credit calculation worksheets; contracts; letter agreements; and invoices and other documentation evidencing the transfer of credits.
              (c) Designation records shall include laboratory analysis reports that identify whether gasoline meets the requirements for a given designation; operational and accounting reports of product storage; and product transfer documents.
              (d) Oxygenate blender records shall include laboratory analysis reports; refiner, importer and oxygenate blender contracts; quality assurance program records; product transfer documents; oxygenate purchasing, inventory, and usage records; and daily tank inventory gauging reports, meter tickets, and product transfer documents.
              (e) Product transfer documents means copies of documents represented by the refiner/importer/oxygenate blender as having been provided to the transferee, and that reflect the transfer of ownership or physical custody of gasoline or blendstock (e.g., invoices, receipts, bills of lading, manifests, and/or pipeline tickets).
              (f) Tender means the transfer of ownership or physical custody of a volume of gasoline or other petroleum product all of which has the same identification (reformulated gasoline, conventional gasoline, RBOB, and other non-finished-gasoline petroleum products), and characteristics (time and place of use restrictions for reformulated gasoline and RBOB).
              (g) Volume records shall include summaries of gasoline produced or imported that account for the volume of each type of gasoline produced or imported. The volumes shall be based on tank gauges or meter reports and temperature adjusted to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
              (h) Attestor means the CPA or CIA performing the agreed-upon procedures engagement under this subpart.
              (i) Foot (or crossfoot) means to add a series of numbers, generally in columns (or rows), to a total amount. When applying the attestation procedures in this subpart F, the attestor may foot to subtotals on a sample basis in those instances where subtotals (e.g., page totals) exist. In such instances, the total should be footed from the subtotals and the subtotals should be footed on a test basis using no less than 25% of the subtotals.
              (j) Laboratory Analysis means the original test result for each analysis that was used to determine a product's properties. For laboratories using test methods that must be correlated to the standard test method, the correlation factors and results shall be included as part of the laboratory analysis. For refineries or importers that produce reformulated gasoline or RBOB and use the 100% independent lab testing, the laboratory analysis shall consist of the results reported to the refinery or importer by the independent lab. Where assumed properties used (e.g., for butane) the assumed properties may serve as the test results.
              (k) Non-finished-gasoline petroleum products means liquid petroleum products that have boiling ranges greater than 75 degrees Fahrenheit, but less than 450 degrees Fahrenheit, as per ASTM D 86 or equivalent.
              (l) Reporting period means the time period relating to the reports filed with EPA by the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender, and generally is the calendar year.

              (2) Option 2. Determine the sample size in such a manner that the sample size is equal to that which would result by using the following parameters and standard statistical methodologies:
              
              
                Confidence Level—95%
                Expected Error Rate—0%
                Maximum Tolerable Error Rate—10%
              
              
              (3) Option 3. The auditor may use some other form of sample selection and/or some other method to determine the sample size, provided that the resulting sample affords equal or better strength of inference and freedom from bias (as compared with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section), and that the auditor summarizes the substitute methods and clearly demonstrates their equivalence in the final report on the audit.

              Agreed upon procedures for GTAB, certain conventional gasoline imported by truck, previously certified gasoline used to produce gasoline, and butane blenders.
              (a) Attest procedures for GTAB. The following are the attest procedures to be carried out in the case of an importer who imports gasoline classified as blendstock (or “GTAB”) under the terms of § 80.83:
              (1) Obtain a listing of all GTAB volumes imported for the reporting period. Agree the total volume of GTAB from the listing to the inventory reconciliation analysis under § 80.133, or agree to alternative documents if the inventory reconciliation analysis is not sufficient.

              (2) Obtain a listing of all GTAB batches reported to EPA by the importer. Agree the total volume of GTAB from the listing to the GTAB volumes reported to EPA. Note that the EPA report includes a notation that the batch is not included in the compliance calculations because the imported product is GTAB. Also, agree these volumes to the Import Summary received from the U.S. Customs Service.
              
              (3) Select a sample, in accordance with the guidelines in § 80.127, from the listing of GTAB batches obtained in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and for each GTAB batch selected perform the following:
              (i) Trace the GTAB batch to the tank activity records. From the tank activity records, determine the volumes of conventional gasoline and of RFG produced. Agree the volumes from the tank activity records to the batch volume reported to the EPA as reformulated or conventional gasoline.
              (ii) Agree the location of the refinery represented by the tank activity records obtained in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section for the gasoline produced from GTAB, to the location that the GTAB arrived in the U.S. or at a facility to which GTAB is directly transported from the import facility using records representing location (e.g., U.S. Customs Service entry records). Using product transfer records, trace volumes transported from the import facility directly to the refinery as applicable.
              (iii) Obtain tank activity records for all batches of GTAB received and blended. Using the tank activity records, determine whether the GTAB was received into an empty tank, or into a tank containing other GTAB imported by that importer or finished gasoline of the same category as the gasoline that will be produced using the GTAB or into a tank containing blendstock.
              (iv) Using the tank activity records obtained under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, determine the volume of any tank bottom (beginning tank inventory) that is previously certified gasoline before GTAB is added to the tank.

              (b) Applicability of gasoline and PRC detergency requirement; responsible parties. (1) Except as specifically exempted in § 80.160, the detergency requirements of this subpart apply to all gasoline, whether intended for on-highway or nonroad use, including conventional, reformulated, oxygenated, and leaded gasolines, as well as the gasoline component of fuel mixtures of gasoline and alcohol fuels, gasoline used as marine fuel, gasoline service accumulation fuel (as described in § 86.113-94(a)(1) of this chapter), the gasoline component of fuel mixtures of gasoline and methanol used for service accumulation in flexible fuel vehicles (as described in § 86.113-94(d) of this chapter), gasoline used for factory fill purposes, and all additized PRC.
              (2) Pursuant to paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, compliance with these requirements is the responsibility of parties who directly or indirectly sell or dispense gasoline to the ultimate consumer as well as parties who manufacture, supply, or transfer detergent additives or detergent-additized post-refinery components.
              (c) Detergent registration requirements. To be eligible for use by fuel manufacturers in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, a detergent additive package must be registered by its manufacturer under 40 CFR part 79 according to the specifications in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section. After evaluating the adequacy of registration data provided by the detergent manufacturer pursuant to these requirements, if EPA finds the data to be deficient, EPA may disqualify the detergent package for use in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section.
              
              (1) Compositional data. The compositional data supplied to EPA by the additive manufacturer for purpose of registering a detergent additive package under § 79.21(a) of this chapter must include:
              (i) A complete listing of the components of the detergent additive package, using standard chemical nomenclature when possible or providing the chemical structure of any component for which the standard chemical name is not precise. Polymeric components may be reported as the product of other chemical reactants, provided that the supporting data specified in § 80.162(b) is also reported for such components.
              (ii) The weight and/or volume percent (as applicable) of each component of the package, with variability in these amounts restricted according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (iii) For each detergent-active component of the package, classification into one of the following designations:
              (A) Polyalkyl amine;
              (B) Polyether amine;
              (C) Polyalkylsuccinimide;
              (D) Polyalkylaminophenol;
              (E) Detergent-active carrier oil; and
              (F) Other detergent-active component.
              (2) Allowable variation in compositional data. (i) A single detergent additive registration may contain no variation in the identity of any of the detergent-active components identified pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
              (ii) A single detergent additive registration may specify a range of concentrations for identified detergent-active components, provided that, if each such component were present in the detergent additive package at the lower bound of its reported range of concentration, the minimum recommended concentration reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section would still provide the deposit control effectiveness claimed by the detergent registrant.
              (iii) The identity or concentration of non-detergent-active components of the detergent additive package may vary under a single registration, provided that the range of such variation is specified in the registration, and that such variability does not reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the additive package as compared with the level of effectiveness claimed by the detergent registrant pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section, detergent additive packages which do not satisfy these restrictions must be separately registered. EPA may disqualify an additive for use in satisfying the requirements of this subpart if EPA determines that the variability included within a given detergent additive registration may reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent package such that it could invalidate the minimum recommended concentration reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (v) A change in minimum concentration requirements resulting from a modification of detergent additive composition shall not require a new detergent additive registration or a change in existing registration if:
              (A) The modification is effected by a detergent blender only for its own use or for the use of parties which are subsidiaries of, or share common ownership with, the blender, and the modified detergent is not sold or transferred to other parties; and
              (B) The modification is a dilution of the additive for the purpose of ensuring proper detergent flow in cold weather; and
              (C) Gasoline is the only diluting agent used; and
              (D) The diluted detergent is subsequently added to gasoline at a rate that attains the detergent's registered minimum recommended concentration, taking into account the dilution; and

              (E) EPA is notified, either before or within seven days after the dilution action, of the identity of the detergent, the identity of the diluting material, the amount or percentage of the dilution, the change in treat rate necessitated by the dilution, and the locations and time period of diluted detergent usage. The notification shall be sent or faxed to the address in § 80.174(c).
              
              (3) Minimum recommended concentration. (i) The lower boundary of the recommended range of concentration for the detergent additive package in gasoline, which the additive manufacturer must report pursuant to the registration requirements in § 79.21(d) of this chapter, must equal or exceed the minimum concentration which the manufacturer has determined to be necessary for the control of deposits in the associated fuel type, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The minimum recommended concentration shall be provided to EPA in units of gallons of detergent additive package per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, reported to four digits. This concentration is the lowest additive concentration (LAC) referred to elsewhere in this subpart.
              (ii) The minimum concentration reported in the detergent registration according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section must also be communicated in writing by the additive manufacturer to each fuel manufacturer who purchases the subject detergent for purpose of compliance with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, and to any additive manufacturer who purchases the subject additive with the intent of reselling it to a fuel manufacturer for this purpose.
              (iii) Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, EPA may require the additive manufacturer to submit data to support the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent package at the specified minimum effective concentration. EPA may disqualify an additive for use in satisfying the requirements of this subpart upon finding that the supporting data is inadequate. Manufacturers may be subject to the liabilities and enforcement actions in §§ 80.156 and 80.159 if such a finding is made.
              (iv) Once included in the registration for a detergent additive package, the minimum concentration recommended by the detergent manufacturer to detergent blenders and other users of the detergent additive, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, may not be changed without first notifying EPA. The notification must be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b). Changes to the minimum recommended concentration must be supported by available test data pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
              (v) A manufacturer may use a single set of test data to demonstrate the deposit control effectiveness of more than one registered detergent additive product, provided that:
              (A) The additive products contain all of the same detergent-active components and no detergent-active components other than those contained in common; and
              (B) The minimum concentration recommended for the use of each such additive product is specified such that, when each additive product is mixed in gasoline at the recommended concentration, each of its detergent-active components will be present at a final concentration no less than the lowest concentration for that component shown to be effective by the data available for the tested additive product.
              (d) The rate at which a detergent blender treats gasoline with a detergent additive package must be no less than the minimum recommended concentration reported for the subject detergent additive pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, except under the following conditions:
              (1) If a detergent blender believes that the minimum treat rate recommended by the manufacturer of a detergent additive exceeds the amount of detergent actually required for effective deposit control, and possesses substantiating data consistent with the guidelines in paragraph (e) of this section, then, upon informing EPA in writing of these circumstances, the detergent blender may use the detergent at a lower concentration.

              (2) The notification to EPA must clearly specify the name of the detergent product and its manufacturer, the concentration recommended by the detergent manufacturer, and the lower concentration which the detergent blender intends to use. The notification must also attest that data are available to substantiate the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent at the intended lower concentration. The notification must be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b).
              
              (3) At its discretion, EPA may require that the detergent blender submit the test data purported to substantiate the claimed effectiveness of the lower concentration of the detergent additive. EPA may also require the manufacturer of the subject detergent additive to submit test data substantiating the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent additive registration. In either case, EPA will send a letter to the appropriate party, and the supporting data will be due to EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's letter.
              (i) If the detergent blender fails to submit the required supporting data to EPA in the allotted time period, or if EPA judges the submitted data to be inadequate to support the detergent blender's claim that the lower concentration provides a level of deposit control consistent with the requirements of this section, then EPA will disapprove the use of the detergent at the lower concentration. Further, the detergent blender may be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to §§ 80.156 and 80.159 for any gasoline or PRC it has additized at the lower concentration.
              (ii) If the detergent manufacturer fails to submit the required test data to EPA within the allotted time period, EPA will proceed on the assumption that data are not available to substantiate the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent registration, and the subject additive may be disqualified for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section. The detergent manufacturer may also be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to §§ 80.156 and 80.159.
              (iii) If both parties submit the required information, EPA will evaluate the quality and results of both sets of test data in relation to each other and to industry-consensus test practices and standards, in a manner consistent with the guidelines described in paragraph (e) of this section. EPA will approve or disapprove the use of the detergent at the lower concentration, and will inform both the detergent blender and the detergent manufacturer of the results of its analysis within 60 days of receipt of both sets of data.
              (e) Demonstration of deposit control efficiency. At its discretion, EPA may require a detergent additive registrant to provide test data to support the deposit control effectiveness of a detergent at the minimum concentration recommended, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section and § 79.21(d) of this chapter. The required supporting data must be submitted to EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's request. EPA will notify the submitter, within 60 days after receiving the supporting data, whether the data is adequate to support the deposit control efficiency claimed. Subject to the procedures specified in paragraph (g) of this section, if the supporting data are not submitted or if EPA finds the data insufficient, the detergent may be disqualified for use by fuel manufacturers in complying with the requirements of this subpart. EPA will use the following guidelines in determining the adequacy of the supporting data:
              (1) CARB-based supporting test data. For detergent additives which are certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for use in the State of California (pursuant to Title 13, section 2257 of the California Code of Regulations), the CARB certification data constitutes adequate support of the detergent's effectiveness under this section, with the exception that CARB detergent certification data specific to California Phase II reformulated gasoline (pursuant to Title 13, Chapter 5, Article 1, Subarticle 2, California Code of Regulations, Standards for Gasoline Sold Beginning March 1, 1996) will not be considered adequate support for detergent effectiveness in gasolines that do not conform to the compositional specifications for California's Phase II reformulated gasoline. For CARB-based supporting data to be used to demonstrate detergent performance, the minimum recommended concentration reported in the detergent additive registration must be no less than the concentration of the detergent-active components reported in the subject CARB detergent certification.

              (2) EPA will evaluate the adequacy of other supporting data according to the following guidelines:
              
              (i) Test fuel guidelines.
              (A) The gasoline used in the supporting tests must contain the detergent-active components of the subject detergent additive package in an amount which corresponds to the minimum recommended concentrations recorded in the respective detergent registration, or less than this amount.
              (B) The test fuels must not contain any detergent-active components other than those recorded in the subject detergent registration.
              (C) The test fuels used must be reasonably typical of in-use fuels in their tendency to form deposits. Test fuel taken directly from commercial refinery production stock is acceptable. Specially refined low-deposit-forming fuels such as indolene are not acceptable. Other specially blended test fuels will be evaluated by EPA for acceptability based on the extent to which such fuels adequately represent the deposit-forming tendency of typical (average) in-use fuels, as reflected in the levels of the following fuel parameters: sulfur content, aromatic content, olefin content, T-90, and oxygenate content.
              (D) The composition of the blended test fuel(s) used in carburetor deposit control testing, conducted to support the claimed effectiveness of detergents used in leaded gasoline, should be reasonably typical of in-use gasoline in its tendency to form carburetor deposits (or more severe than typical in-use fuels) as defined by the olefin and sulfur content. Test data using leaded fuels is preferred for this purpose, but data collected using unleaded fuels may also be acceptable provided that some correlation with additive performance in leaded fuels is available.
              (ii) Test procedure guidelines.
              (A) To be acceptable, test data submitted to support the deposit control effectiveness of a detergent additive must derive from testing conducted in conformity with good engineering practices.
              (B) For demonstration of fuel injector and intake valve deposit control performance, the tests specified in §§ 80.165, or other vehicle-based tests using generally accepted industry procedures and standards, are preferred. Engine-based tests may also be acceptable, assuming a reasonable correlation with vehicle-based tests and standards can be demonstrated. Bench test data may be acceptable to demonstrate fuel injector deposit control performance, assuming the results can be correlated with vehicle- or engine-based tests and standards. Bench testing will not be considered acceptable for demonstration of IVD control performance. Examples of acceptable test procedures are contained in the following references:

              (f) Detergent identification test procedure. (1) At its discretion, EPA may require the additive registrant to submit an analytical procedure capable of identifying the detergent additive in its pure state. The test procedure will be due to EPA within 30 days of the registrant's receipt of the request. Subject to the provisions in paragraph (g) of this section, if the registrant fails to submit an analytical procedure, or if EPA judges a submitted procedure to be inadequate, EPA may deny or withdraw the detergent's eligibility to be used to satisfy the detergency requirements in this section.
              (2) The analytical procedure submitted by the registrant must be able to both qualitatively and quantitatively identify each component of the detergent additive package. To be acceptable, the procedure must provide results that conform to reasonable and customary standards of repeatability and reproducibility, and reasonable and customary limits of detection and accuracy, for the type of test in question.
              (3) A fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-based procedure, including an actual infrared spectrum of the detergent additive package and each component part of the detergent package obtained from this test method, is preferred.
              (g) Disqualification of a detergent additive package. (1) When EPA makes a preliminary determination that a detergent additive registrant has failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c), (d)(3)(ii), (e), or (f) of this section, either by failing to submit required information for a subject detergent additive or by submitting information which EPA deems inadequate, EPA shall notify the additive registrant by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the basis for that determination and informing the registrant that the detergent may lose its eligibility to be used to comply with the detergency requirements of this section.

              (2) If EPA determines that the detergent registration was created by fraud or other misconduct, such as a negligent disregard for the truthfulness or accuracy of the required information or of the application, the detergent registration will be considered void ab initio and the revocation of qualification will be retroactive to January 1, 1995 or the date on which the additive product was first registered, whichever is later.

              (3) The registrant will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of detergent disqualification to submit written comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If the registrant does not respond in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of disqualification, the detergent disqualification shall become final by operation of law and the Administrator shall notify the registrant of such disqualification. If the registrant responds in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to disqualify, the Administrator shall review and consider all comments submitted by the registrant before taking final action concerning the proposed disqualification. All correspondence regarding a disqualification must be sent to the address specified in § 80.174(b).
              
              (4) As part of a written response to a notice of intent to disqualify, a registrant may request an informal hearing concerning the notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information the registrant wishes to present at such a hearing. If an informal hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 90 days from the date of receipt of the request. If an informal hearing is held, the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether or not the registrant has complied with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If an informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall be informal, and the hearing shall not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, or 557. A verbatim transcript of each informal hearing shall be kept and the Administrator shall consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented at the hearing in making a final decision concerning a proposed cancellation.

              (5) If a registrant who has received a notice of intent to disqualify submits a timely written response, and the Administrator decides after reviewing the response and the transcript of any informal hearing to disqualify the detergent for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, the Administrator shall issue a final disqualification order, forward a copy of the disqualification order to the registrant by certified mail, and promptly publish the disqualification order in the Federal Register. Any disqualification order issued after receipt of a timely written response by the registrant shall become legally effective five days after it is published in the Federal Register.
              
              (6) Upon making a final decision to disqualify a detergent additive package pursuant to this paragraph (g), EPA shall inform all fuel manufacturers and secondary additive manufacturers whose product registrations report the potential use of the disqualified detergent that such detergent is no longer eligible for compliance with the requirements of this subpart. Such fuel manufacturers and secondary additive manufacturers shall have 45 days in which to stop using the ineligible detergent additive package and substitute an eligible detergent additive. When applicable, EPA shall also notify such parties that the detergent registration had been created by fraud or other misconduct, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

              (4) Volumetric additive reconciliation. Where a violation of the volumetric additive reconciliation requirements established by § 80.155(b) has occurred, the following persons shall be deemed in violation:
              (i) Each detergent blender who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises the facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) where the violation has occurred; and
              (ii) Each gasoline refiner, importer, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, or oxygenate blender, and each detergent manufacturer, carrier, distributor, or blender, who refined, imported, manufactured, sold, offered for sale, dispensed, supplied, offered for supply, stored, transported, or caused the transportation of the detergent-additized gasoline, the base gasoline component, the detergent component, or the detergent-additized post-refinery component, of the gasoline that is in violation, provided that the EPA demonstrates, by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence, that such person caused the violation.
              (5) Product transfer document. Where a violation of § 80.155(c) is found at a facility owned, leased, operated, controlled, or supervised by any gasoline refiner, importer, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, carrier, distributor, or blender, the following persons shall be deemed in violation: each gasoline refiner, importer, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer, wholesale-purchaser consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, carrier, distributor, or blender, who owns, leases, operates, control or supervises the facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) where the violation is found.
              (b) Branded refiner vicarious liability. Where any violation of the prohibitions specified in § 80.155 has occurred, with the exception of violations of § 80.155(c), a refiner will also be deemed liable for violations occurring at a facility operating under such refiner's corporate, trade, or brand name or that of any of its marketing subsidiaries. For purposes of this section, the word facility includes, but is not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank.
              (c) Defenses. (1) In any case in which a gasoline refiner, importer, distributor, carrier, reseller, retailer, wholesale-purchaser consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent distributor, carrier, or blender, is in violation of any of the prohibitions of § 80.155, pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section as applicable, the regulated party shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate:
              (i) That the violation was not caused by the regulated party or its employee or agent (unless otherwise provided in this paragraph (c));
              (ii) That product transfer documents account for the gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized post-refinery component in violation and indicate that the gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized post-refinery component satisfied relevant requirements when it left their control; and
              (iii) That the party has fulfilled the requirements of paragraphs (c) (2) or (3) of this section, as applicable.
              (2) Branded refiner. (i) Where a branded refiner, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, is in violation of any of the prohibitions of § 80.155 as a result of violations occurring at a facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) which is operating under the corporate, trade or brand name of a refiner or that of any of its marketing subsidiaries, the refiner shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate, in addition to the defense requirements stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that the violation was caused by:
              (A) An act in violation of law (other than these regulations), or an act of sabotage or vandalism, whether or not such acts are violations of law in the jurisdiction where the violation of the prohibitions of § 80.155 occurred; or

              (B) The action of any gasoline refiner, importer, reseller, distributor, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, distributor, blender, or retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer supplied by any of these persons, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner designed to prevent such action, and despite the implementation of an oversight program, including, but not limited to, periodic review of product transfer documents by the refiner to ensure compliance with such contractual obligation; or
              (C) The action of any gasoline or detergent carrier, or other gasoline or detergent distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by the refiner for transportation of gasoline, post-refinery component, or detergent, to a gasoline or detergent distributor, oxygenate blender, detergent blender, gasoline retailer or wholesale purchaser consumer, despite specification or inspection of procedures or equipment by the refiner which are reasonably calculated to prevent such action.
              (ii) In this paragraph (c)(2), to show that the violation “was caused” by any of the specified actions, the party must demonstrate by reasonably specific showings, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.
              (3) Detergent blender. In any case in which a detergent blender is liable for violating any of the prohibitions of § 80.155, the detergent blender shall not be deemed in violation if it can demonstrate, in addition to the defense requirements stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the following:
              (i) That it obtained or supplied, as appropriate, prior to the detergent blending, accurate written instructions from the detergent manufacturer or other party with knowledge of such instructions, specifying the detergent's minimum recommended concentration (lowest additive concentration) pursuant to § 80.141(c)(3) and, if applicable, the limitations of this concentration for use in leaded product.
              (ii) That it has implemented a quality assurance program that includes, but is not limited to, a periodic review of its supporting product transfer and volume measurement documents to confirm the correctness of its product transfer and volumetric additive reconciliation documents created for all products it additized.
              (4) Detergent manufacturer—(i) Presumptive liability affirmative defense. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for violating any of the prohibitions of § 80.155, the detergent manufacturer shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate each of the following:
              (A) Product transfer documents which account for the detergent component of the product in violation and which indicate that such detergent satisfied all relevant requirements when it left the detergent manufacturer's control; and
              (B) Written blending instructions which, pursuant to § 80.141(c)(3)(ii), were supplied by the detergent manufacturer to its customer who purchased or obtained from the manufacturer the detergent component of the product determined to be in violation. The written blending instructions must have been supplied by the manufacturer prior to the customer's use or sale of the detergent. The instructions must accurately identify the minimum recommended concentration (lowest additive concentration) specified in the detergent's 40 CFR part 79 registration, and must also accurately identify if the detergent, at that concentration, is only registered as effective for use in leaded gasoline.
              (C) If the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product was produced less than one year before the manufacturer was notified by EPA of the possible violation, then the manufacturer must provide FTIR or other test results for the batch of detergent used in the noncomplying product, performed in accordance with the detergent testing procedure submitted by the manufacturer, or available for submission, pursuant to § 80.141(f).
              (1) The analysis may have been conducted on the subject detergent batch at the time it was manufactured, or may be conducted on a sample of that batch which the manufacturer retained for such purpose at the time the batch was manufactured.
              (2) The test results must accurately establish that, when it left the manufacturer's control, the detergent component of the product determined to be in violation was in conformity with the chemical composition and concentration specifications reported pursuant to § 80.141(c)(1);
              (D) If the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product was produced more than one year prior to the manufacturer's notification by EPA of the possible violation, then the manufacturer must provide either:
              (1) Test results for the batch in question as specified in the paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section; or
              (2) The following materials:
              (i) Documentation of the measured viscosity, density, and basic nitrogen content of the detergent batch in question, or any other such physical parameters which the manufacturer normally uses to ensure production quality control, which establishes conformity with the manufacturer's quality control standards for such parameters; and
              (ii) If the detergent registration identifies polymeric component(s) of the detergent package as the product(s) of other chemical reactants, documentation that the reagents used to synthesize the detergent batch in question were the same as those specified in the registration and that they met the manufacturer's normal acceptance criteria for such reagents, reported pursuant to § 80.162(b)(1).
              (ii) Detergent manufacturer causation liability. In any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for a violation of § 80.155, and the manufacturer establishes an affirmative defense to such liability pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, the detergent manufacturer will nonetheless be deemed liable for the violation of § 80.155 if EPA can demonstrate, by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the detergent manufacturer caused the violation.
              (5) Defense against liability where more than one party may be liable for VAR violations. In any case in which a party is presumptively or vicariously liable for a violation of § 80.155 due to a failure to meet the VAR requirements § 80.157, except for the VAR record requirements pursuant to § 80.157(g), such party shall not be deemed liable if it can establish the following:
              (i) Prior to the violation it had entered into a written contract with another potentially liable detergent blender party (“the assuming party”), under which that other party assumed legal responsibility for fulfilling the VAR requirement that had been violated;
              (ii) The contract included reasonable oversight provisions to ensure that the assuming party fulfilled its VAR responsibilities (including, but not limited to, periodic review of VAR records) and the oversight provision was actually implemented by the party raising the defense;
              (iii) The assuming party is fiscally sound and able to pay its penalty for the VAR violation; and
              (iv) The employees or agents of the party raising the defense did not cause the violation.
              (6) Defense to liability for gasoline non-conformity violations caused solely by the addition of misadditized ethanol or other PRC to the gasoline. In any case in which a party is presumptively or vicariously liable for a gasoline non-conformity violation of § 80.155(a) caused solely by another party's addition of misadditized ethanol or other PRC to the gasoline, the former party shall not be deemed liable for the violation provided that it can establish that is has fulfilled the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (7) Detergent tank transitioning defenses. The commingling of two detergents in the same detergent storage tank will not be deemed to violate or cause violations of any of the provisions of this subpart, provided the following conditions are met:

              (i) The commingling must occur during a legitimate detergent transitioning event, i.e., a shift from the use of one detergent to another through the delivery of the new detergent into the same tank that contains the original detergent; and
              (ii) If the new detergent is restricted to use in leaded gasoline, then such restriction must be applied to the combined detergents; and

              (iii) The commingling event must be documented, either on the VAR formula record or on attached supporting records; and
              
              (iv) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in § 80.157, a VAR formula record must be created for the combined detergents. The VAR compliance period must begin no later than the time of the commingling event. However, at the blender's option, the compliance period may begin earlier, thus including use of the uncombined original detergent within the same period, provided that the 31-day limitation pursuant to § 80.157(a)(6) is not exceeded; and
              (v) The VAR formula record must also satisfy the requirements in one of the following paragraphs (c)(7)(v)(A) through (C) of this section, whichever applies to the commingling event. If neither paragraph (c)(7)(v)(A) nor (B) of this section initially applies, then the blender may drain and subsequently redeliver the original detergent into the tank in restricted amounts, in order to meet the conditions of paragraph (c)(7)(v)(A) or (B) of this section. Otherwise, the blender must comply with paragraph (c)(7)(v)(C) of this section.
              (A) If both detergents have the same LAC, and the original detergent accounts for no more than 20 percent of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent.
              (B) If the two detergents have different LACs and the original detergent accounts for 10 percent or less of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent, and must attain the LAC of the new detergent. If the original detergent's LAC is greater than that of the new detergent, then the compliance period may begin earlier than the date of the commingling event (pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section) only if the original detergent does not exceed 10 percent of the total detergent used during the compliance period.
              (C) If neither of the preceding paragraphs (c)(7)(v)(A) or (B) of this section applies, then the VAR formula record must identify both of the commingled detergents, and must use and attain the higher LAC of the two detergents. Once the commingled detergent has been depleted by an amount equal to the volume of the original detergent in the tank at the time the new detergent was added, subsequent VAR formula records must identify and use the LAC of only the new detergent.
              (8) Defense to liability for noncompliance with leaded-only use restrictions. A party shall not be deemed liable for violations of § 80.155(a) or (e) caused solely by the additization or use of gasoline or PRC in violation of leaded-only use restrictions, provided that the conditions specified in § 80.169(c)(9) are met.
              (d) Detergent manufacturer causation liability. In any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for a violation of § 80.155 pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and the manufacturer establishes affirmative defense to such liability pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the detergent manufacturer will be liable for the violation of § 80.155 pursuant to this paragraph (d) of this section, provided that EPA can demonstrate, by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the detergent manufacturer caused the violation.
              [59 FR 54706, Nov. 1, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 35358, July 5, 1996]
            
            
              § 80.157
              Volumetric additive reconciliation (“VAR”), equipment calibration, and recordkeeping requirements.

              This section contains requirements for automated detergent blending facilities and hand-blending detergent facilities. All gasolines and all PRC intended for use in gasoline must be additized, unless otherwise noted in supporting VAR records, and must be accounted for in VAR records. The VAR reconciliation standard is attained under this section when the actual concentration of detergent used per VAR formula record equals or exceeds the lowest additive concentration (LAC) specified for that detergent pursuant to § 80.141(c)(3), or, if appropriate, under § 80.141(d). A separate VAR formula record must be created for leaded gasoline additized with a detergent registered for use only with leaded gasoline, or used at a concentration that is registered as effective for leaded gasoline only. Detergent so used must be accurately and separately measured, either through the use of a separate storage tank, a separate meter, or some other measurement system that is able to accurately distinguish its use. Recorded volumes of gasoline, detergent, and PRC must be expressed to the nearest gallon (or smaller units), except that detergent volumes of five gallons or less must be expressed to the nearest tenth of a gallon (or smaller units). However, if the blender's equipment cannot accurately measure to the nearest tenth of a gallon, then such volumes must be rounded downward to the next lower gallon. PRC included in the reconciliation must be identified. Each VAR formula record must also contain the following information:
              (a) Automated blending facilities. In the case of an automated detergent blending facility, for each VAR period, for each detergent storage system and each detergent in that storage system, the following must be recorded:
              (1) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the detergent additive package being reconciled, and the LAC specified in the detergent registration for use with the applicable type of gasoline (i.e., unleaded or leaded). The LAC must be expressed in terms of gallons of detergent per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, and expressed to four digits. If the specified LAC is only effective for use with leaded gasoline, the record must so indicate. If the detergent storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.
              (2) The total volume of detergent blended into gasoline and PRC, in accordance with one of the following paragraphs, as applicable.
              (i) For a facility which uses in-line meters to measure detergent usage, the total volume of detergent measured, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter readings for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.

              (ii) For a facility which uses a gauge to measure the inventory of the detergent storage tank, the total volume of detergent shall be calculated from the following equation:
              
              Detergent Volume = (A) − (B) + (C) − (D)
              
              
                where:
                
                A = Initial detergent inventory of the tank
                B = Final detergent inventory of the tank
                C = Sum of any additions to detergent inventory
                D = Sum of any withdrawals from detergent inventory for purposes other than the additization of gasoline or PRC.
              
              
              The value of each variable in this equation must be separately recorded on the VAR formula record. In addition, a list of each detergent addition included in variable C and a list of each detergent withdrawal included in variable D must be provided, either on the formula record or as VAR supporting documentation.
              (3) The total volume of gasoline plus PRC to which detergent has been added, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: The beginning and ending meter measurements for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. If gasoline has intentionally been overadditized in anticipation of the later addition of unadditized PRC, then the total volume of gasoline plus PRC recorded must include the expected amount of unadditized PRC to be added later. In addition, the amount of gasoline which was overadditized for this purpose must be specified.

              (4) The actual detergent concentration, calculated as the total volume of detergent added (pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section), divided by the total volume of gasoline plus PRC (pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four digits.
              
              (5) A list of each detergent concentration rate initially set for the detergent that is the subject of the VAR record, together with the date and description of each adjustment to any initially set concentration. The concentration adjustment information may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. No concentration setting is permitted below the applicable LAC, except as may be modified pursuant to § 80.141(d) or as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
              (6) The dates of the VAR period, which shall be no longer than thirty-one days. If the VAR period is contemporaneous with a calendar month, then specifying the month will fulfill this requirement; if not, then the beginning and ending dates and times of the VAR period must be listed. The times may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in supporting documentation. Any adjustment to any detergent concentration rate more than 10 percent over the concentration rate initially set in the VAR period shall terminate that VAR period and initiate a new VAR period, except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
              (7) The concentration setting for a detergent injector may be set below the applicable LAC, or it may be adjusted more than 10 percent above the concentration initially set in the VAR period without terminating that VAR period, provided that:
              (i) The purpose of the change is to correct a batch misadditization prior to the end of the VAR period and prior to the transfer of the batch to another party, or to correct an equipment malfunction; and
              (ii) The concentration is immediately returned after the correction to a concentration that fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section; and
              (iii) The blender creates and maintains documentation establishing the date and adjustments of the correction; and
              (iv) If the correction is initiated only to rectify an equipment malfunction, and the amount of detergent used in this procedure is not added to gasoline in the compliance period, then this amount is subtracted from the detergent volume listed on the VAR formula record.
              (8) If unadditized gasoline has been transferred from the facility, other than bulk transfers from refineries or pipelines to non-retail outlets or non-WPC facilities, the total amount of such gasoline must be specified.
              (b) Non-automated facilities. In the case of a facility in which hand blending or any other non-automated method is used to blend detergent, for each detergent and for each batch of gasoline and each batch of PRC to which the detergent is being added, the following shall be recorded:
              (1) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the detergent additive package being reconciled, and the LAC specified in the detergent registration for use with the applicable type of gasoline (i.e., unleaded or leaded). The LAC must be expressed in terms of gallons of detergent per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, and expressed to four digits. If the specified LAC is only effective for use with leaded gasoline, the record must so indicate.
              (2) The date of the additization that is the subject of the VAR formula record.
              (3) The volume of added detergent.
              (4) The volume of the gasoline and/or PRC to which the detergent has been added. If gasoline has intentionally been overadditized in anticipation of the later addition of unadditized PRC, then the total volume of gasoline plus PRC recorded must include the expected amount of unadditized PRC to be added later. In addition, the amount of gasoline which was overadditized for this purpose must be specified.
              (5) The brand (if known), grade, and leaded/unleaded status of gasoline, and/or the type of PRC.
              (6) The actual detergent concentration, calculated as the volume of added detergent (pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section), divided by the volume of gasoline and/or PRC (pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four digits.

              (c) Every VAR formula record created pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall contain the following:
              (1) The signature of the creator of the VAR record;
              (2) The date of the creation of the VAR record; and
              (3) A certification of correctness by the creator of the VAR record.
              (d) Electronically-generated VAR formula and supporting records. (1) Electronically-generated records are acceptable for VAR formula records and supporting documentation (including PTDs), provided that they are complete, accessible, and easily readable. VAR formula records must also be stored with access and audit security, which must restrict to a limited number of specified people those who have the ability to alter or delete the records. In addition, parties maintaining records electronically must make available for EPA use the hardware and software necessary to review the records.
              (2) Electronically-generated VAR formula records may use an electronic user identification code to satisfy the signature requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that:
              (i) The use of the ID is limited to the record creator; and

              § 80.158
              Product transfer documents (PTDs).
              (a) Contents. For each occasion when any gasoline refiner, importer, reseller, distributor, carrier, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, distributor, carrier, or blender, transfers custody or title to any gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC other than when detergent-additized gasoline is sold or dispensed at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility to the ultimate consumer, the transferor shall provide to the transferee, and the transferee shall acquire from the transferor, documents which accurately include the following information:
              (1) The names and addresses of the transferee and transferor; the address requirement may be fulfilled, in the alternative, through separate documentation which establishes said addresses and is maintained by the parties and made available to EPA for the same length of time as required for the PTDs, provided that the normal business procedure of these parties is not to identify addresses on PTDs.
              (2) The date of the transfer.
              (3) The volume of product transferred.
              (4)(i) The identity of the product being transferred (i.e., its identity as base gasoline, detergent, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized oxygenate or detergent-additized gasoline blending stock that comprises a detergent-additized PRC). PTDs for detergent-additized gasoline or PRC are not required to identify the particular detergent used to additize the product.
              (ii) If the product being transferred consists of two or more different types of product subject to this regulation, i.e., base gasoline, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized PRC, then the PTD for the commingled product must identify each such type of component contained in the commingled product.
              (5) If the product being transferred is base gasoline, then in addition to the base gasoline identification, the following warning must be stated on the PTD: “Not for sale to the ultimate consumer”. If, pursuant to § 80.160(a), the product being transferred is exempt base gasoline to be used for research, development, or test purposes only, the following warning must also be stated on the PTD: “For use in research, development, and test programs only.”
              (6) The name of the detergent additive as reported in its registration must be used to identify the detergent package on its PTD.
              (7) If the product being transferred is leaded gasoline, then the PTD must disclose that the product contains lead and/or phosphorous, as applicable.

              (8) If the product being transferred is detergent that is only authorized for the control of carburetor deposits, then the following must be stated on the detergent's transfer document: “For use with leaded gasoline only.”
              (9) If the product being transferred is detergent-additized gasoline that has been overadditized in anticipation of the later (or earlier) addition of PRC, then the PTD must include a statement that the product has been overadditized to account for a specified volume in gallons, or a specified percentage of the product's total volume, of additional, specified PRC.
              (b) Gasoline may not be additized with a detergent authorized only for the control of carburetor deposits and whose product transfer document states “For use with leaded gasoline only”, and gasoline may not be additized at the lower concentration specified for a detergent authorized at a lower concentration for the control of carburetor deposits only, unless the product transfer document for the gasoline to be additized identifies it as leaded gasoline.
              (c) Use of product codes and other non-regulatory language. (1) Product codes and other non-regulatory language may not be used as a substitute for the specified PTD warning language specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for base gasoline, except that:
              (i) The specified warning language may be omitted for bulk transfers of base gasoline from a refinery to a pipeline if there is a prior written agreement between the parties specifying that all such gasoline is unadditized and will not be transferred to the ultimate consumer;
              (ii) Product codes may be used as a substitute for the specified warning language provided that the PTD is an electronic data interchange (EDI) document being used solely for the transfer of title to the base gasoline, and provided that the product codes otherwise comply with the requirements of this section.
              (2) Product codes and other language not specified in this section may otherwise be used to comply with PTD information requirements, provided that they are clear, accurate, and not misleading.
              (3) If product codes are used, they must be standardized throughout the distribution system in which they are used, and downstream parties must be informed of their full meaning.
              (d) PTD exemption for small transfers of additized gasoline. Transfers of additized gasoline are exempt from the PTD requirements of this section provided all the following conditions are followed:
              (1) The product is being transferred by a distributor who is not the product's detergent blender; and
              (2) The recipient is a wholesale purchaser-consumer (WPC) or other ultimate consumer of gasoline, for its own use only or for that of its agents or employees; and
              (3) The volume of additized gasoline being transferred is not greater than 550 gallons.
              (e) Recordkeeping period. Any person creating, providing or acquiring product transfer documentation for gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, shall retain the documents required by this section for a period of five years from the date the product transfer documentation was created, received or transferred, as applicable, and shall deliver such documents to EPA upon request. WPCs are not required to retain PTDs of additized gasoline received by them.

              [61 FR 35363, July 5, 1996]
            
            
              § 80.161
              Detergent additive certification program.
              (a) Effective dates and applicability of requirements. (1) As of July 1, 1997:
              (i) Detergent additives for the control of port fuel injector deposits (PFID) and/or intake valve deposits (IVD) in gasoline engines may not be transferred or sold for use in compliance with this subpart unless such additives have been certified according to the requirements of this section.
              (ii) Except as provided in § 80.169(c)(8), PFID and IVD control additives may not be added to gasoline or post-refinery component (PRC) for compliance with this subpart unless such additives have been certified according to the requirements of this section.
              (iii) Gasoline may not be sold or transferred to a party who sells or transfers gasoline to the ultimate consumer unless such gasoline contains detergent additives which have been certified according to the requirements of this section.
              (2) Beginning August 1, 1997, all gasoline sold or transferred to the ultimate consumer must contain detergent additive(s) which have been certified, according to the requirements of this section, to be effective for the control of PFID and IVD in gasoline engines.
              (3) Except as specifically exempted in § 80.173, these detergency requirements apply to all gasoline, whether intended for on-highway or nonroad use, including conventional, oxygenated, reformulated, and leaded gasolines, as well as the gasoline component in mixtures of petroleum and alcohol fuels, gasoline used as marine fuel, gasoline service accumulation fuel (as described in § 86.113-94(a)(1) of this chapter), the gasoline component of fuel mixtures of petroleum and methanol used for service accumulation in flexible fuel vehicles (as described in § 86.113-94(d) of this chapter), the gasoline used for factory fill purposes, and all additized PRC.
              (4) The specific controls and prohibitions applicable to persons subject to these regulations are set forth in § 80.168.
              (b) Detergent additive certification requirements. For a detergent additive package to be certified as eligible for use by detergent blenders in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, the requirements listed in this paragraph (b) must be satisfied for such detergent. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, if the certifier fails to conduct the specified tests or to submit the specified materials, or if EPA judges the testing or materials to be inadequate, or if the detergent fails EPA confirmatory deposit control performance testing pursuant to § 80.167, the Administrator may deny or withdraw the detergent's eligibility to be used to satisfy the detergency requirements of this subpart.
              (1) The detergent additive manufacturer must properly register the detergent additive under 40 CFR part 79. For this purpose:
              (i) The compositional data required under § 79.21(a) of this chapter shall include the information specified in § 80.162.
              (ii) The minimum recommended additive concentration required under § 79.21(d) of this chapter shall be reported to EPA in units of gallons of detergent additive package per 1000 gallons of gasoline or PRC, provided to four digits. This concentration is the lowest additive concentration (LAC) referred to in § 80.170, and shall be reported as follows:
              (A) For a detergent additive registered for use in unleaded gasoline, the minimum concentration must be determined and reported for each certification option under which the manufacturer wishes to certify the additive pursuant to § 80.163.
              (1) In the case of a detergent certified for use in California gasoline based on an existing certification granted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), pursuant to § 80.163(d), the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount specified in the CARB certification.
              (2) In the case of the alternative national generic certification option pursuant to § 80.163(a)(1)(iii), the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount mixed into the associated test fuel specified in § 80.177, which was shown to satisfy the fuel injector deposit control and intake valve deposit control performance tests and standards specified in § 80.176.
              (3) In the case of any other detergent certification option, the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount mixed into the associated test fuel specified in § 80.164, which was shown to satisfy the fuel injector deposit control and intake valve deposit control performance tests and standards specified in § 80.165.
              (B) For a detergent registered for use in leaded gasoline, the minimum recommended concentration must be no less than the amount shown to be needed for control of carburetor deposits, pursuant to the test procedure and test fuel guidelines in § 80.166.
              (C) Once it has been registered by EPA, the minimum recommended concentration specified by a detergent manufacturer to detergent blenders and other users of the additive, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, may not be changed without first notifying EPA. Such notification should be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b). The change in minimum concentration must be supported by existing certification data or else the notification to EPA must be accompanied by new certification information which demonstrates that the modification is consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
              (D) A manufacturer may use a single set of certification test data to demonstrate the deposit control effectiveness of more than one registered detergent additive product, provided that:
              (1) The additive products contain all of the same detergent-active components and no detergent-active components other than those contained in common; and
              (2) The minimum concentration recommended for the use of each such additive product is specified such that, when each additive product is mixed in gasoline at the recommended concentration, each of its detergent-active components will be present at a final concentration no less than the lowest concentration of that component which was present when the tested additive product met the PFID and IVD performance standards specified in § 80.165.

              (2) The detergent additive manufacturer (or other certifying party) must submit to EPA a sample of the actual detergent additive package which was used in the certification test fuels specified in § 80.164 or § 80.177 or, if such sample is not available, then a sample which has the same composition as the package used in certification testing.
              (i) The sample volume shall be between 250 ml and 500 ml.
              (ii) The sample shall be packaged in a container which has a resealable closure and which will maintain sample integrity for at least one year. The container shall be labeled with the name and address of the manufacturer and the name of the detergent additive package.
              (iii) Any known shelf life limitations, and any available information on optimal temperature, light exposure, or other conditions to prolong sample shelf life, shall be provided.
              (iv) If the certifying party wishes to claim that the sample or any accompanying documents are entitled to special handling for reasons of business confidentiality, the party must clearly identify the sample or documents as such. EPA will handle any samples or documents with such claims according to the regulations at 40 CFR part 2.
              (v) The sample shall be submitted to EPA, at the address provided in § 80.174(a), within seven days of the date on which the certification letter for the detergent package is sent to EPA as required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (3) The detergent additive manufacturer (or other certifying party) shall submit a certification letter for the detergent additive package to the address in § 80.174(b). The party must use certified or express mail with return receipt service. The letter shall be signed by a person legally authorized to represent the certifying party and shall contain the following information:
              (i) Identifying information.
              (A) The name and address of the detergent additive manufacturer.

              (4) EPA will acknowledge receipt of the detergent certification letter. The effective date of certification will be the sooner of 60 days from the date on which EPA receives the certification letter, or the certifier's receipt of EPA's acknowledgement of the certification letter. However, neither the passage of 60 days nor EPA's acknowledgement will signify acceptance by EPA of the validity of the information in the certification letter or the adequacy or potency of the detergent sample submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. EPA may elect at any time to review the detergent certification data, analyze the submitted detergent additive sample, or subject the detergent additive package to confirmatory testing as described in § 80.167 and, where appropriate, may disqualify a detergent certification according to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section.
              (c) The minimum concentration reported in the detergent registration according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, plus any restrictions in use associated with that concentration, must be accurately communicated in writing by the additive manufacturer to each fuel manufacturer or detergent blender who purchases the subject detergent for purpose of compliance with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, and to any additive manufacturer who purchases the subject additive with the intent of reselling it to a fuel manufacturer for this purpose.
              (d) The rate at which a detergent blender treats gasoline with a detergent additive package must be no less than the minimum recommended concentration reported for the subject detergent additive pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, except under the following conditions:
              (1) If a detergent blender possesses deposit control performance test results as specified in § 80.165, § 80.166, or § 80.176 which show that the minimum treat rate recommended by the manufacturer of a detergent additive product exceeds the amount of that detergent actually required for effective deposit control, then, upon informing EPA in writing of these circumstances, the detergent blender may use the detergent at the lower concentration substantiated by these test results.
              (2) The notification to EPA must clearly specify the name of the detergent product and its manufacturer, the concentration recommended by the detergent manufacturer, and the lower concentration which the detergent blender intends to use. The notification must also attest that the required data are available to substantiate the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent at the intended lower concentration. The notification must be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b).

              (3) At its discretion, EPA may require that the detergent blender submit the test data purported to substantiate the claimed effectiveness of the lower concentration of the detergent additive. In addition, EPA may require the manufacturer of the subject detergent additive to submit test data substantiating the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent additive registration. In either case, EPA will send a letter to the appropriate party; the supporting data will be due to EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's letter.
              (i) If the detergent blender fails to submit the required supporting data to EPA in the allotted time period, or if EPA judges the submitted data to be inadequate to support the detergent blender's claim that the lower concentration provides a level of deposit control consistent with the requirements of this section, then EPA will disapprove the use of the detergent at the lower concentration. Further, the detergent blender may be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to §§ 80.169 and 80.172 for any gasoline or PRC it has additized at the lower concentration.
              (ii) If the detergent manufacturer fails to submit the required test data to EPA within the allotted time period, EPA will proceed on the assumption that data are not available to substantiate the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent registration, and the subject additive may be disqualified for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section. The detergent manufacturer may also be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties in §§ 80.169 and 80.172.
              (iii) If both parties submit the required information, EPA will evaluate the quality and results of both sets of test data, and will either approve or disapprove the use of the lower treat rate submitted by the detergent blender. EPA will inform both parties of the results of its analysis.
              (e) Disqualification of a detergent additive package. (1) When EPA makes a preliminary determination that a detergent additive certifier has failed to comply with the detergent certification requirements of this section, including a failure to submit required materials for a detergent additive or submission of materials which EPA deems inadequate, or if a detergent additive fails confirmatory testing conducted pursuant to § 80.167, EPA shall notify the additive certifier by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the basis for that determination and informing the certifier that the detergent may lose its eligibility to be used to comply with the detergency requirements of this section.

              (2) If EPA determines that the detergent certification was created by fraud or other misconduct, such as a negligent disregard for the truthfulness or accuracy of the required information, the detergent certification will be considered void ab initio and the disqualification will be retroactive to July 1, 1997 or the date on which the additive product was first certified, whichever is later.
              (3) The certifier will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of detergent disqualification to submit written comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the specific requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If the certifier does not respond in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of disqualification, the detergent disqualification shall become final and the Administrator shall notify the certifier of such final disqualification order. If the certifier responds in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to disqualify, the Administrator shall review and consider all comments submitted by the certifier before taking final action concerning the proposed disqualification. All correspondence regarding a disqualification must be sent to the address provided in § 80.174(b).

              (4) As part of a written response to a notice of intent to disqualify, a certifier may request an informal hearing concerning the notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information the certifier wishes to present at such a hearing. If an informal hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 90 days from the date of receipt of the request. If an informal hearing is held, the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether or not the certifier has complied with the specific requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If an informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall be informal, and the hearing shall not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, or 557. A verbatim transcript of each informal hearing shall be kept and the Administrator (or designee) shall consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented at the hearing in making a final decision concerning a proposed disqualification.

              (5) If a certifier who has received a notice of intent to disqualify submits a timely written response, and the Administrator (or designee) decides after reviewing the response and the transcript of any informal hearing to disqualify the detergent for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, the Administrator (or designee) shall issue a final disqualification order and forward a copy of the disqualification order to the certifier by certified mail. Notice of the disqualification order will also be published in the Federal Register. The disqualification will become effective as of the date on which the copy of the order is received by the certifier. If the certifier is also a blender of the disqualified additive, then the certifier must stop using the ineligible detergent upon receipt of the disqualification order.

              (6) Within 10 days of receipt of EPA's notification of the final decision to disqualify a detergent additive package pursuant to this paragraph (e), the detergent certifier must submit to EPA, at the address specified in § 80.174(b), a list of its customers who use the disqualified detergent. Failure to do so may subject the certifier to liabilities for violations of § 80.168 that result from the use of the uncertified detergent. EPA shall inform the certifier's customers by certified mail that the detergent is no longer eligible for compliance with the requirements of this subpart. These parties must stop using the ineligible detergent additive package and substitute an eligible detergent additive within 45 days of receiving the notification, or within 45 days of publication of the disqualification notice in the Federal Register, whichever occurs sooner.

              § 80.162
              Additive compositional data.
              For a detergent additive product to be eligible for use by detergent blenders in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, the compositional data to be supplied to EPA by the additive manufacturer for the purpose of registering a detergent additive package under § 79.21(a) of this chapter must include the items listed in this section. In the case of items requiring measurement or other technical analysis, and for which a specific test procedure is not stipulated herein, the procedure must conform to reasonable and customary standards of repeatability and reproducibility, and reasonable and customary limits of detection and accuracy for the type of test procedure or analytic procedure in question. At EPA's request, detailed documentation of any such test procedure must be submitted within 10 days of the registrant's receipt of EPA's request.
              (a) A complete listing of the components of the detergent additive package and the weight and/or volume percent (as applicable) of each component of the package.
              (1) When possible, standard chemical nomenclature shall be used or the chemical structure of the component shall be given. Polymeric components may be reported as the product of other chemical reactants, provided that the supporting data specified in paragraph (b) of this section is also reported.
              (2) Each detergent-active component of the package shall be classified into one of the following designations:
              (i) Polyalkyl amine;
              (ii) Polyether amine;
              (iii) Polyalkylsuccinimide;
              (iv) Polyalkylaminophenol;
              (v) Detergent-active petroleum-based carrier oil;
              (vi) Detergent-active synthetic carrier oil; and
              (vii) Other detergent-active component (identify category, if feasible.)
              (3) Composition variability.
              
              (i) The composition of a detergent additive reported in a single additive registration (and the detergent additive product sold under a single additive registration) may not:
              (A) Include detergent-active components which differ in identity from those contained in the detergent additive package at the time of certification testing; or
              (B) Include a range of concentration for any detergent-active component such that, if the component were present in the detergent additive package at the lower bound of the reported range, the deposit control effectiveness of the additive package would be reduced as compared with the level of effectiveness demonstrated during certification testing. Subject to the foregoing constraint, a detergent additive product sold under a particular additive registration may contain a higher concentration of the detergent-active component(s) than the concentration(s) of such component(s) reported in the registration for the additive.
              (ii) The identity or concentration of non-detergent-active components of the detergent additive package may vary under a single registration provided that such variability does not reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the additive package as compared with the level of effectiveness demonstrated during certification testing.
              (A) Unless the additive manufacturer (or other certifying party) provides EPA with data to substantiate that a carrier oil does not act to enhance the detergent additive package's ability to control deposits, any carrier oil contained in the detergent additive package, whether petroleum-based or synthetic, must be treated as a detergent-active component in accordance with the additive compositional reporting requirements in § 80.162(a)(2). Such data should be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b).
              (B) [Reserved]
              (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section, detergent additive packages which do not satisfy the restrictions in this paragraph (a)(3) must be separately registered. EPA may disqualify an additive for use in satisfying the requirements of this subpart if EPA determines that the variability included within a given detergent additive registration may reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent package such that it may invalidate the minimum recommended concentration reported in accordance with the applicable requirements of § 80.161(b)(1)(ii).
              (iv) A change in minimum concentration requirements resulting from a modification of detergent additive composition shall not require a new detergent additive registration or a change in existing registration if:
              (A) The modification is effected by a detergent blender only for its own use or for the use of parties which are subsidiaries of, or share common ownership with, the blender, and the modified detergent is not sold or transferred to other parties; and
              (B) The modification is a dilution of the additive for the purpose of ensuring proper detergent flow in cold weather; and
              (C) Gasoline is the only diluting agent used; and
              (D) The diluted detergent is subsequently added to gasoline at a rate that attains the detergent's registered minimum recommended concentration, taking into account the dilution; and
              (E) EPA is notified, either before or within seven days after the dilution action, of the identity of the detergent, the identity of the diluting material, the amount or percentage of the dilution, the change in treat rate necessitated by the dilution, and the locations and time period of diluted detergent usage. The notification shall be sent or faxed to the address in § 80.174(c).
              (b) For detergent-active polymers and detergent-active carrier oils which are reported as the product of other chemical reactants:

              (1) Identification of the reactant materials and the manufacturer's acceptance criteria for determining that these materials are suitable for use in synthesizing detergent components. The manufacturer must maintain documentation, and submit it to EPA upon request, demonstrating that the acceptance criteria reported to EPA are the same criteria which the manufacturer specifies to the suppliers of the reactant materials.
              
              (2) A Gel Permeation Chromatograph (GPC), providing the molecular weight distribution of the polymer or detergent-active carrier oil components and the concentration of each chromatographic peak representing more than one percent of the total mass. For these results to be acceptable, the GPC test procedure must include equipment calibration with a polystyrene standard or other readily attainable and generally accepted calibration standard. The identity of the calibration standard must be provided, together with the GPC characterization of the standard.
              (c) For non-detergent-active carrier oils, the following parameters:
              (1) T10, T50, and T90 distillation points, and end boiling point, measured according to applicable test procedures cited in § 80.46.
              (2) API gravity and viscosity
              (3) Concentration of oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, if greater than or equal to 0.5 percent (by weight) of the carrier oil
              (d) Description of an FTIR-based method appropriate for identifying the detergent additive package and its detergent-active components (polymers, carrier oils, and others) both qualitatively and quantitatively, together with the actual infrared spectra of the detergent additive package and each detergent-active component obtained by this test method. The FTIR infrared spectra submitted in connection with the registration of a detergent additive package must reflect the results of a test conducted on a sample of the additive containing the detergent-active component(s) at a concentration no lower than the concentration(s) (or the lower bound of a range of concentration) reported in the registration pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section.

              (e) To provide a basis for establishing an affirmative defense to presumptive liability pursuant to § 80.169(c)(4)(i)(D)(2)(i), specific physical parameters must be identified which the manufacturer considers adequate and appropriate, in combination with other information and sampling requirements under this subpart, for identifying the detergent additive package and monitoring its production quality control.
              (1) Such parameters shall include (but need not be limited to) viscosity, density, and basic nitrogen content, unless the additive manufacturer specifically requests, and EPA approves, the substitution of other parameter(s) which the manufacturer considers to be more appropriate for a particular additive package. The request must be made in writing and must include an explanation of how the requested physical parameter(s) are helpful as indicator(s) of detergent production quality control. EPA will respond to such requests in writing; the additional parameters are not approved until the certifier receives EPA's written approval.
              (2) The manufacturer shall identify a standardized measurement method, consistent with the chemical and physical nature of the detergent product, which will be used to measure each parameter. The documented ASTM repeatability for the method shall also be cited. The manufacturer's target value for each parameter in the detergent package, and the expected range of production values for each parameter, shall be specified.
              (3) EPA will consider the parameter measurements to be an acceptable basis for establishing an affirmative defense to presumptive liability, if the expected range of variability differs from the target value by an amount no greater than five times the standard repeatability of the test procedure, or by no more than 10 percent of the target value, whichever is less. However, in the case of nitrogen analysis or other procedures for measuring concentrations of specific chemical compounds or elements, when the target value is less than 10 parts per million, a range of variability up to 50 percent of the target value will be considered acceptable.

              (4) If a manufacturer wishes to rely on measurement methods or production variability ranges which do not conform to the above limitations, then the manufacturer must receive prior written approval from EPA in order to be assured that any related parameter measurements will be considered an acceptable basis for establishing an affirmative defense. A request for such allowance must be made in writing. It must fully justify the adequacy of the test procedure, explain why a broader range of variability is required, and provide evidence that the production detergent will perform adequately throughout the requested range of variability.

              § 80.163
              Detergent certification options.
              To be used to satisfy the detergency requirements under § 80.161(a), a detergent additive must be certified in accordance with the requirements of one or more of the options and suboptions described in this section. Where a certification option makes an additive eligible for use in a particular gasoline, that additive is also eligible for use in PRC which will be added to the particular gasoline. Under each option, the lowest additive concentration (LAC) or minimum recommended concentration registered for a detergent additive package, pursuant to § 80.161(b)(1)(ii), must equal or exceed the lowest detergent treat rate shown to be needed in the designated test fuel in order to meet the deposit control performance requirements specified in § 80.165.
              (a) National certification. A detergent certified under a national certification option is eligible for use in gasoline which can be sold or dispensed anywhere within the United States or its territories (subject to approved State programs).
              (1) National generic certification option. To be certified under this option, a candidate detergent must meet the deposit control performance test requirements and standards specified in § 80.165 using test fuels that conform to the requirements in § 80.164(b)(1), Table 1, Line 1. A detergent certified under this option is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC in any grade of gasoline, with or without an oxygenate component.
              (i) National nonoxygenate suboption. The requirements for certification under this suboption are the same as those in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that, pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2)(ii), the certification test fuel shall contain no ethanol or other oxygenate. A detergent certified under this suboption is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in gasoline that does not contain an oxygenate component.
              (ii) National oxygenate-specific suboption. The requirements for certification under this suboption are the same as those in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that, pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2)(iii), the certification test fuel shall contain an oxygenate compound other than ethanol. A detergent certified under this suboption is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in gasoline that contains no oxygenate component other than the one present in the test fuel.
              (iii) Alternative national generic certification option. To be certified under this option, a candidate detergent must meet the deposit control performance test requirements and standards specified in § 80.176 using test fuels that conform to the requirements in § 80.177.

A detergent certified under this suboption is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in premium grade gasoline that does not contain an oxygenate component.
              
              (ii) National premium oxygenate-specific suboption. The requirements for certification under this suboption are the same as those in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that, pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2)(iii), the certification test fuel shall contain an oxygenate compound other than ethanol. A detergent certified under this suboption is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in gasoline that is premium grade and contains no oxygenate component other than the one present in the test fuel.
              (b) Petroleum Administrative Defense District (PADD) Certification. A detergent certified under a PADD certification option is eligible for use in gasoline which can be sold or dispensed to the ultimate purchaser, or to those parties who sell or dispense to the ultimate consumer, only within the PADD for which the certification was granted. The States and jurisdictions included within each PADD are specified in § 79.59(b)(3)(i) through (v), except that, for purposes of PADD certification, the State of California is excluded from PADD V.
              (1) PADD generic certification option. To be certified under this option, a candidate detergent must meet the deposit control performance test requirements and standards specified in § 80.165 using test fuels that conform to the requirements in § 80.164(b)(1), Table 2, for a selected PADD. A detergent certified under this option is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC in any grade of gasoline, with or without an oxygenate component, provided that the gasoline is ultimately dispensed in the selected PADD.
              (i) PADD nonoxygenate suboption. The requirements for certification under this suboption are the same as those in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that, pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2)(ii), the certification test fuel shall contain no ethanol or other oxygenate. A detergent certified under this suboption is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in gasoline that is nonoxygenated and is ultimately dispensed in the selected PADD.
              (ii) PADD oxygenate-specific suboption. The requirements for certification under this suboption are the same as those in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that, pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2)(iii), the certification test fuel shall contain an oxygenate compound other than ethanol. A detergent certified under this suboption is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in gasoline that contains no oxygenate component other than the one present in the test fuel and is ultimately dispensed in the selected PADD.
              (2) PADD premium certification option. To be certified under this option, a candidate detergent must meet the deposit control performance test requirements and standards specified in § 80.165 using test fuels that conform to the requirements in § 80.164(b)(1), Table 2, for a selected PADD. A detergent certified under this option is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in gasoline that is premium grade (with or without an oxygenate component) and is ultimately dispensed in the selected PADD.
              (i) PADD premium nonoxygenate suboption. The requirements for certification under this suboption are the same as those in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except that, pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2)(ii), the certification test fuel shall contain no ethanol or other oxygenate. A detergent certified under this suboption is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in gasoline that is premium grade, contains no oxygenate component, and is ultimately dispensed in the selected PADD.
              (ii) PADD premium oxygenate-specific suboption. The requirements for certification under this suboption are the same as those in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except that, pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2)(iii), the certification test fuel shall contain an oxygenate compound other than ethanol. A detergent certified under this suboption is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in gasoline that is premium grade, contains no oxygenate component other than the one present in the test fuel, and is ultimately dispensed in the selected PADD.
              (c) Fuel-specific certification. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, to be certified under the fuel-specific certification option, a candidate detergent must meet the deposit control performance test requirements and standards specified in § 80.165 using test fuels that conform to the requirements of § 80.164(c).
              (1) A detergent certified under this option is eligible to be used at a conforming LAC only in the defined gasoline pool reported in the certification letter pursuant to § 80.161(b)(3).
              (i) The gasoline pool may only include gasoline produced or distributed from the facilities covered by the fuel survey which was used to define the fuel-specific certification test fuels, pursuant to § 80.164(c)(1).
              (ii) The gasoline pool must be kept segregated from any other gasoline prior to blending with the detergent additive.
              (iii) Depending on the oxygenate components added to the test fuel pursuant to § 80.164(a)(2), the gasoline pool may be inclusive of all grades and all oxygenate blending characteristics (i.e., generic), or may be restricted to non-oxygenated gasoline, or to gasoline containing a specific oxygenate compound. The certification may also be restricted to premium grade gasoline. Any such use restrictions must be specified in the certification letter. Provisions in §§ 80.168 and 80.171(a)(9) through (12) related to such use restrictions also apply.
              (2) Detergent certification under this option entails special initial and annual reporting requirements, specified under §§ 80.161(b)(3)(vi) and 80.164(c)(3), which necessitate that the responsible party have control over and access to the segregated gasoline pool for which the detergent is certified. For this reason, the certifying party under this option is likely to be (but is not required to be) a fuel manufacturer or detergent blender, rather than the additive manufacturer.
              (3) If a certifier demonstrates that the required test fuel representing a segregated pool of gasoline meets the deposit control performance standards specified in § 80.165 in the absence of a detergent additive, or using a detergent additive which has only PFID-control activity, then this gasoline pool (and PFID detergent, if applicable) can be certified accordingly under the fuel-specific option.
              (4) Gasoline properly additized with a detergent certified under the fuel-specific option may be transferred or sold anywhere within the United States and its territories (subject to approved State programs).
              (d) CARB-Based Certification. A valid certification under section 2257 of Title 13, California Code of Regulations (CARB certification) may be the basis for a certification under the following restrictions and conditions:
              (1) A detergent certified under this option may be used at the LAC specified in the CARB certification only in gasoline that meets the requirements of California Phase II reformulated gasoline (pursuant to Title 13, Chapter 5, Article 1, Subarticle 2, California Code of Regulations, Standards for Gasoline Sold Beginning March 1, 1996). The grade(s) of California gasoline which may be so additized, and the oxygenate(s) which may be present, are as specified in the CARB certification for the detergent in question.
              (2) The gasoline must be either: Additized in California; or sold or dispensed to the ultimate consumer in California (or to parties who sell or dispense to the ultimate consumer in California); or both additized and ultimately dispensed in California.
              (3) A certification under this option will continue to be valid only as long as the CARB certification remains valid. The certifier must cease selling or using a detergent immediately upon being notified by CARB that the CARB certification for this detergent has been invalidated, and must notify EPA within 7 days of receipt of this notification.

This section provides specifications for the test fuels required in conjunction with the certification options described in §§ 80.163(a)(1) and 80.163(b) through (d). For each such certification option, the associated test fuel must meet or exceed the levels of four basic fuel parameters (aromatics, fuel sulfur, olefins, and T-90) prescribed here and may also contain specified oxygenate compounds. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, some fuels must undergo an IVD demonstration test before they are eligible to be used as test fuels under this certification program. Test fuel characteristics must be reported to EPA in the detergent certification letter required pursuant to § 80.161(b)(3). The specifications for the test fuels required in conjunction with the alternative national generic certification option in § 80.163(a)(1)(iii) are contained in § 80.177.
              (1) Quantitative specifications for the four basic fuel parameters, provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, refer to the levels of these parameters in the base gasoline prior to the addition of any oxygenate. The levels of the basic fuel parameters must be measured in accordance with applicable procedures in § 80.46.
              (2) Oxygenate components of certification test fuels must be of fuel grade quality. The type and amount of oxygenate to be blended into the test fuel (if any) shall be as follows:
              (i) To certify a detergent for generic use (i.e., for use in gasoline containing any oxygenate compound, as well as for use in nonoxygenated gasoline), the finished test fuel shall contain ethanol at 10 volume percent.
              (ii) To certify a detergent specifically for use in nonoxygenated gasoline, no oxygenate compounds shall be added to the test fuel.
              (iii) To certify a detergent specifically for use in gasoline blended with a specified oxygenate compound other than ethanol, the specified oxygenate must be added to the test fuel in an amount such that the finished fuel contains the oxygenate at the highest concentration at which the specific oxygenate may be used in in-use gasoline.
              (3) No detergent-active substance other than the detergent additive package undergoing testing may be added to a certification test fuel. Typical nondetergent additives, such as antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, and metal deactivators, may be present in the test fuel at the discretion of the additive certifier. In addition, any nondetergent additives (other than oxygenate compounds) which are commonly blended into gasoline and which are known or suspected to affect IVD or PFID formation, or to reduce the ability of the detergent in question to control such deposits, should be added to the test fuel for certification testing.
              (4) Certification test requirements may be satisfied for a detergent additive using more than one batch of test fuel, provided that each batch satisfies all applicable test fuel requirements under this section.

              (5) Unless otherwise required by this section, finished test fuels must conform to the requirements for commercial gasoline described in ASTM D 4814-95c, “Standard Specification for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel”, which is incorporated by reference. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

              (b) National and PADD certification test fuels. (1) Test fuels for the national generic and premium certification options must contain levels of the designated fuel parameters which meet or exceed the applicable values in Table 1. Test fuels for the PADD generic certification options must contain levels of the designated fuel parameters which meet or exceed the applicable values in Table 2. Test fuels for the PADD premium certification options must contain levels of the designated fuel parameters which meet or exceed the applicable values in Table 3. Oxygenate requirements for the respective nonoxygenate and oxygenate-specific suboptions are specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

              (2) National and PADD certification test fuels must either be formulated to specification from normal refinery blend stocks, or drawn from finished gasoline supplies. The source of such samples must be normally-operating gasoline production or distribution facilities located in the U.S. Samples must not be drawn from a segregated gasoline pool that is or will be covered by a fuel-specific certification under § 80.163(c) on the date when the certification information under this option is submitted to EPA.
              (3) To be eligible for use in detergent additive certification testing, in addition to the specifications above, national and PADD test fuels which are specially formulated from refinery blend stocks must themselves undergo testing to demonstrate their deposit-forming tendency. For this purpose, the unadditized, nonoxygenated test fuel must be subjected to the IVD control test procedure described in § 80.165(b). At the discretion of the tester, the duration of the demonstration test may be less than 10,000 miles, provided the results satisfy the standard of this paragraph. In order to qualify for use in certification testing, the formulated fuel's test results must meet or exceed the values shown in Table 4 for the relevant certification option. If the demonstration test results do not meet these criteria, then the formulated fuel may not be used for detergent certification testing.

              (c) Fuel-specific certification test fuels. (1) Test fuels required for fuel-specific certification must contain levels of each of the four basic fuel parameters (aromatics, olefins, T-90, and fuel sulfur) at no less than their respective 65th percentile values in the segregated gasoline pool for which the detergent certification is sought in accordance with § 80.163(c). These values must be determined by the certifier as follows:
              (i) At least once monthly for at least one complete year prior to the certification, the certifier must measure the levels of the required parameters in representative fuel samples contributed to the segregated gasoline pool by each participating refinery, terminal, or other fuel production or distribution facility. The fuel parameters must be measured in accordance with the test procedures in § 80.46. If the applicability of the fuel-specific certification is to be limited to premium gasoline, then the required fuel compositional data must be collected only from samples of premium gasoline.
              (ii) The fuel composition survey results, weighted according to the percentage of gasoline contributed to the segregated gasoline pool from each participating facility, shall be used to construct a percentile distribution of the measured values for each of the fuel parameters.
              (iii) Data from more than one year may be used to construct the required statistical distribution provided that only the total data from complete consecutive years is used and that all survey data must have been collected within three years of the date the certification information is submitted to EPA.
              (iv) At the discretion of the certifier, other fuel parameters may be used to define the certification test fuels in addition to the four required parameters. To be taken into account by EPA in case of confirmatory testing pursuant to § 80.167, such additional parameters must be surveyed and analyzed according to the same requirements applicable to the four standard parameters. In addition, any optional parameters must be measured using test procedures which conform to reasonable and customary standards of repeatability and reproducibility, and reasonable and customary limits of detection and accuracy for the type of test procedure or analytic procedure in question.
              (v) Using the percentile distributions calculated from the survey data for the four required parameters and any additional discretionary parameters, the 65th percentile value for each such parameter shall be determined. Prior to the addition of any oxygenate compound, the fuel-specific certification test fuel shall contain each specified parameter at a level or concentration no less than this 65th percentile value. Test fuel oxygenate requirements for generic, nonoxygenate, and oxygenate-specific certification suboptions are specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (2) Fuel-specific certification test fuels must either be formulated to specification from the same refinery blend stocks which are normally used to blend the gasolines included in the subject gasoline pool, or drawn from the finished fuel supplies which contribute to this pool of gasoline. Fuel-specific certification test fuels need not undergo an IVD demonstration test prior to use in certification testing.
              (3) The certifier must submit an annual report to EPA within 30 days of the anniversary of the initial certification effective date. Failure to submit the annual report by the required date will invalidate the fuel-specific certification and may subject the certifier to liability and penalties under §§ 80.169 and 80.172. The purpose of the annual report is to update the information on the composition of the segregated gasoline pool that was characterized by the initial fuel survey.
              (i) For this purpose, the same fuel survey and statistical analysis requirements that were conducted pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(i),(ii), and (iv) of this section must be repeated, using data for the most current twelve-month period from each of the production/distribution facilities that contributed to the original fuel survey.

              (ii) The annual report must present the percentile distributions for each fuel parameter as determined from the new survey data and, for each measured fuel parameter, must compare the newly determined 50th percentile value with the 60th percentile value for that parameter as determined in the original fuel survey.
              (iii) If the new 50th percentile level for any fuel parameter is greater than or equal to the 60th percentile level reported in the initial certification, then the fuel-specific certification is no longer valid. In such instance, the certifier must immediately discontinue the sale and use of the subject detergent under the conditions of the fuel-specific certification and must immediately notify any downstream customers/recipients of the subject detergent that the certification is no longer valid and that their use of the detergent must discontinue within seven days. To avoid liability and penalties under §§ 80.169 and 80.172, the certifier must take these remedial steps within 45 days of the anniversary of the original fuel-specific certification. Downstream customers/recipients must discontinue usage of the detergent within seven days of receipt of notification of the detergent's invalidity to avoid such liability.
              (4) The fuel composition survey results which support the original test fuel specifications and the annual statistical analyses, along with related documentation on test methods and statistical procedures, shall be retained by the certifier for a period of at least five years, and shall be made available to EPA upon request.

              § 80.165
              Certification test procedures and standards.

              This section specifies the deposit control test requirements and performance standards which must be met in order to certify detergent additives for use in unleaded gasoline, pursuant to § 80.161(b)(1)(ii)(A)(3). These standards must be met in the context of the specific test procedures identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The testing must be conducted and the performance standards met when the subject detergent additive is mixed in a test fuel meeting all relevant requirements of § 80.164, including the deposit-forming tendency demonstration specified in § 80.164(b)(3), if applicable. Complete test documentation must be submitted by the certifying party within 30 days of receipt of a written request from EPA for such records. The certification test procedures and standards associated with the alternative national generic certification option in § 80.163(a)(1)(iii) are contained in § 80.176.
              (a) Fuel injector deposit control testing. The required test fuel must produce no more than 5% flow restriction in any one injector when tested in accordance with ASTM D5598. At the option of the certifier, fuel injector flow may be measured at intervals during the 10,000 mile test cycle described in ASTM D5598, in addition to the flow measurements required at the completion of the test cycle, but not more than every 1,000 miles.
              (b) Intake valve deposit control testing. The required test fuel must produce the accumulation of less than 100 mg of intake valve deposits on average when tested in accordance with ASTM D5500.

              (3) The composition of the test fuel used in carburetor deposit control testing, conducted to support the claimed effectiveness of detergents used in leaded gasoline, should be reasonably typical of in-use gasoline in its tendency to form carburetor deposits (or more severe than typical in-use fuels) as defined by the olefin and sulfur content. A test fuel conforming to these compositional guidelines may be sampled directly from finished gasolines or may be blended to specification using typical refinery blend stocks. Test data using leaded fuels is preferred for this purpose, but data collected using unleaded fuels may also be acceptable provided that some correlation with additive performance in leaded fuels is available.

              § 80.167
              Confirmatory testing.
              EPA may test a detergent to confirm that the required performance levels are met. Based on the findings of this confirmatory testing, a detergent certification may be denied or revoked under the provisions of § 80.161(e).
              (a) Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of detergent certifications under the national, PADD, or fuel-specific options under §§ 80.163(a)(1) and 80.163(b) through (d) will generally entail a single vehicle test using the procedures detailed in § 80.165. The test fuel(s) used in conducting such confirmatory certification testing will contain the specified fuel parameters at or below the minimum levels specified in § 80.164, and will otherwise conform to the applicable certification test fuel specifications therein. Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of detergent certifications under the alternative national generic certification option in § 80.163(a)(1)(iii) will generally entail a single test using the procedures detailed in § 80.177. The test fuel(s) used in conducting such confirmatory certification testing will contain the specified fuel parameters at or below the minimum levels specified in § 80.177, and will otherwise conform to the applicable certification test fuel specifications therein.
              (b) Confirmatory certification testing conducted to evaluate the validity of CARB-based detergent certifications will use the subject detergent in test fuel(s) containing the relevant fuel parameters at levels no greater than the maximum levels for which the CARB certification was granted. The test procedures will be conducted pursuant to the procedures specified under section 2257 of Title 13, California Code of Regulations.
              (c) Confirmatory testing conducted to evaluate the validity of registration and certification information specific to detergent use in leaded gasoline will use the subject detergent in a test fuel containing the test fuel parameters at levels no greater than those prescribed in § 80.164. EPA will make all reasonable efforts to use the same test procedure for confirmatory testing purposes as was used by the certifier in conducting deposit control performance testing.
              (d) When EPA decides to conduct confirmatory testing on a fuel or additive which is not readily available in the open market, EPA may request that the detergent certifier and/or manufacturer of such fuel or additive furnish a sample in the needed quantity. If testing is conducted to evaluate the validity of a detergent certification under the fuel-specific option, the detergent blender must supply EPA with test fuel, or with blend stocks with which to formulate such test fuel, in sufficient quantity to conduct the specified deposit control performance testing. The fuel or additive manufacturer shall comply with a sample request made pursuant to this paragraph within 30 days of receipt of the request.

              Detergent certification program controls and prohibitions.
              (a)(1) No person shall sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, transport, or cause the transportation of gasoline to the ultimate consumer for use in motor vehicles or in any off-road engines (except as provided in § 80.173), or to a gasoline retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer, and no person shall detergent-additize gasoline, unless such gasoline is additized in conformity with the requirements of § 80.161. No person shall cause the presence of any gasoline in the gasoline distribution system unless such gasoline is additized in conformity with the requirements of § 80.161.
              (2) Gasoline has been additized in conformity with the requirements of § 80.161 when the detergent component satisfies the requirements of § 80.161 and when:
              (i) The gasoline has been additized in conformity with the detergent composition and purpose-in-use specifications of a detergent certified in accordance with this subpart, and in accordance with at least the minimum concentration specifications of that detergent as certified or as otherwise provided under § 80.161(d); or

              (ii) The gasoline is composed of two or more commingled gasolines and each component gasoline has been additized in conformity with the detergent composition and purpose-in-use specifications of a detergent certified in accordance with this subpart, and in accordance with at least the minimum concentration specifications of that detergent as certified or as otherwise provided under § 80.161(d); or
              (iii) The gasoline is composed of a gasoline commingled with a post-refinery component (PRC), and both of these components have been additized in conformity with the detergent composition and use specifications of a detergent certified in accordance with this subpart, and in accordance with at least the minimum concentration specifications of that detergent as certified or as otherwise provided under § 80.161(d).
              (b) No person shall blend detergent into gasoline or PRC unless such person complies with the volumetric additive reconciliation requirements of § 80.170.
              (c) No person shall sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, store, transport, or cause the transportation of any gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC, unless the product transfer document for the gasoline, detergent or detergent-additized PRC complies with the requirements of § 80.171.
              (d) No person shall refine, import, manufacture, sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, store, transport, or cause the transportation of any detergent that is to be used as a component of detergent-additized gasoline or detergent-additized PRC unless such detergent conforms with the composition specifications of a detergent certified in accordance with this subpart and the detergent otherwise complies with the requirements of § 80.161. No person shall cause the presence of any detergent in the detergent, PRC, or gasoline distribution systems unless such detergent complies with the requirements of § 80.161.
              (e)(1) No person shall sell, offer for sale, dispense, supply, offer for supply, transport, or cause the transportation of detergent-additized PRC unless the PRC has been additized in conformity with the requirements of § 80.161. No person shall cause the presence in the PRC or gasoline distribution systems of any detergent-additized PRC that fails to conform to the requirements of § 80.161.
              (2) PRC has been additized in conformity with the requirements of § 80.161 when the detergent component satisfies the requirements of § 80.161 and when:
              (i) The PRC has been additized in accordance with the detergent composition and use specifications of a detergent certified in accordance with this subpart and in conformity with at least the minimum concentration specifications of that detergent as certified or as otherwise provided under § 80.161(d), or
              (ii) The PRC is composed of two or more commingled PRCs, and each component has been additized in accordance with the detergent composition and use specifications of a detergent certified in accordance with this subpart, and in conformity with at least the minimum concentration specifications of that detergent as certified or as otherwise provided under § 80.161(d).

              (iii) Each gasoline or detergent carrier who dispensed, supplied, stored, or transported any detergent which is in the storage tank or container containing detergent found to be in violation, provided that EPA demonstrates, by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the gasoline or detergent carrier caused the violation.
              (4) Volumetric additive reconciliation. Where a violation of the volumetric additive reconciliation requirements established by § 80.168(b) has occurred, the following persons shall be deemed in violation:
              (i) Each detergent blender who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises the facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) where the violation has occurred; and
              (ii) Each gasoline refiner, importer, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, or oxygenate blender, and each detergent manufacturer, carrier, distributor, or blender, who refined, imported, manufactured, sold, offered for sale, dispensed, supplied, offered for supply, stored, transported, or caused the transportation of the detergent-additized gasoline, the base gasoline component, the detergent component, or the detergent-additized PRC of the gasoline that is in violation, provided that EPA demonstrates, by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence, that such person caused the violation.
              (5) Product transfer document. Where a violation of § 80.168(c) is found at a facility owned, leased, operated, controlled, or supervised by any gasoline refiner, importer, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, carrier, distributor, or blender, the following persons shall be deemed in violation: each gasoline refiner, importer, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, carrier, distributor, or blender, who owns, leases, operates, control or supervises the facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) where the violation is found.
              (b) Branded Refiner Vicarious Liability. Where any violation of the prohibitions specified in § 80.168 has occurred, with the exception of violations of § 80.168(c), a refiner will also be deemed liable for violations occurring at a facility operating under such refiner's corporate, trade, or brand name or that of any of its marketing subsidiaries. For purposes of this section, the word facility includes, but is not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank.
              (c) Defenses. (1) In any case in which a gasoline refiner, importer, distributor, carrier, reseller, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent distributor, carrier, or blender, is in violation of any of the prohibitions of § 80.168, pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section as applicable, the regulated party shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate:
              (i) That the violation was not caused by the regulated party or its employee or agent (unless otherwise provided in this paragraph (c));
              (ii) That product transfer documents account for the gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC in violation and indicate that the gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC satisfied relevant requirements when it left the party's control; and
              (iii) That the party has fulfilled the requirements of paragraphs (c) (2) or (3) of this section, as applicable.
              (2) Branded refiner. Where a branded refiner is in violation of any of the prohibitions of § 80.168 as a result of violations occurring at a facility (including, but not limited to, a truck or individual storage tank) which is operating under the corporate, trade or brand name of a refiner or that of any of its marketing subsidiaries, the refiner shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate, in addition to the defense requirements stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that the violation was caused by:
              (i) An act in violation of law (other than these regulations), or an act of sabotage or vandalism, whether or not such acts are violations of law in the jurisdiction where the violation of the prohibitions of § 80.168 occurred; or

              (ii) The action of any gasoline refiner, importer, reseller, distributor, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, distributor, blender, or retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer supplied by any of these persons, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner designed to prevent such action, and despite the implementation of an oversight program, including, but not limited to, periodic review of product transfer documents by the refiner to ensure compliance with such contractual obligation; or
              (iii) The action of any gasoline or detergent carrier, or other gasoline or detergent distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by the refiner for transportation of gasoline, PRC, or detergent, to a gasoline or detergent distributor, oxygenate blender, detergent blender, gasoline retailer or wholesale purchaser consumer, despite specification or inspection of procedures or equipment by the refiner which are reasonably calculated to prevent such action.
              (iv) In this paragraph (c)(2), to show that the violation “was caused” by any of the specified actions, the party must demonstrate by reasonably specific showings, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another.
              (3) Detergent blender. In any case in which a detergent blender is liable for violating any of the prohibitions of § 80.168, the detergent blender shall not be deemed in violation if it can demonstrate, in addition to the defense requirements stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the following:
              (i) That it obtained or supplied, as appropriate, prior to the detergent blending, accurate written instructions from the detergent manufacturer or other party with knowledge of such instructions, specifying the appropriate LAC for the detergent, as specified in § 80.161(b)(1)(ii), together with any use restrictions which pertain to this LAC pursuant to the detergent's certification; and
              (ii) That it has implemented a quality assurance program that includes, but is not limited to, a periodic review of its supporting product transfer and volume measurement documents to confirm the correctness of its product transfer and volumetric additive reconciliation documents created for all products it additized.
              (4) Detergent manufacturer. (i) Presumptive Liability Affirmative Defense. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for violating any of the prohibitions of § 80.168, the detergent manufacturer shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate each of the following:
              (A) Product transfer documents which account for the detergent component of the product in violation and which indicate that such detergent satisfied all relevant requirements when it left the detergent manufacturer's control.
              (B) Written blending instructions which, pursuant to § 80.161(c), were supplied by the detergent manufacturer to its customer who purchased or obtained from the manufacturer the detergent component of the product determined to be in violation. The written blending instructions must have been supplied by the manufacturer prior to the customer's use or sale of the detergent. The instructions must accurately specify both the appropriate LAC for the detergent, pursuant to § 80.161(b)(1)(ii), plus any use restrictions which may pertain to this LAC pursuant to the detergent's certification.
              (C) If the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product was produced less than one year before the manufacturer was notified by EPA of the possible violation, then the manufacturer must provide FTIR test results for the batch in question.
              (1) The FTIR analysis may have been conducted on the subject detergent batch at the time it was manufactured, or may be conducted on a sample of that batch which the manufacturer retained for such purpose at the time the batch was manufactured.
              (2) To establish that, when it left the manufacturer's control, the detergent component of the noncomplying product was in conformity with the chemical composition and concentration specifications reported pursuant to § 80.161(b), the FTIR test results for the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product must be consistent with the FTIR results submitted at the time of registration pursuant to § 80.162(d).
              
              (D) If the detergent batch used in the noncomplying product was produced more than one year prior to the manufacturer's notification by EPA of the possible violation, then the manufacturer must provide either:
              (1) FTIR test results for the batch in question as specified in the preceding paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this § 80.169(c); or
              (2) The following materials:
              (i) Documentation for the batch in question, showing that its measured viscosity, density, and basic nitrogen content, or any other such physical parameter(s) which EPA may have approved for monitoring production quality control, were within the acceptable range of production values specified in the certification pursuant to § 80.162(e); and
              (ii) If the detergent registration identifies polymeric component(s) of the detergent package as the product(s) of other chemical reactants, documentation that the reagents used to synthesize the detergent batch in question were the same as those specified in the registration and that they met the manufacturer's normal acceptance criteria reported pursuant to § 80.162(b)(1).
              (ii) Detergent manufacturer causation liability. In any case in which a detergent manufacturer is liable for a violation of § 80.168, and the manufacturer establishes an affirmative defense to such liability pursuant to § 80.169(c)(4)(i), the detergent manufacturer will nonetheless be deemed liable for the violation of § 80.168 if EPA can demonstrate, by reasonably specific showings by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the detergent manufacturer caused the violation.
              (5) Defense against liability where more than one party may be liable for VAR violations. In any case in which a party is presumptively or vicariously liable for a violation of § 80.170, except for the VAR record requirements pursuant to § 80.170(g), such party shall not be deemed liable if it can establish the following:
              (i) Prior to the violation it had entered into a written contract with another potentially liable detergent blender party (“the assuming party”), under which that other party assumed legal responsibility for fulfilling the VAR requirement that had been violated;
              (ii) The contract included reasonable oversight provision to ensure that the assuming party fulfilled its VAR responsibilities (including, but not limited to, periodic review of VAR records) and the oversight provision was actually implemented by the party raising the defense;
              (iii) The assuming party is fiscally sound and able to pay its penalty for the VAR violation; and
              (iv) The employees or agents of the party raising the defense did not cause the violation.
              (6) Defense to liability for gasoline non-conformity violations caused solely by the addition of misadditized ethanol or other PRC to the gasoline. In any case in which a party is presumptively or vicariously liable for a gasoline non-conformity violation of § 80.168(a) caused solely by another party's addition of misadditized ethanol or other PRC to the gasoline, the former party shall not be deemed liable for the violation, provided that it can establish that it has fulfilled the defense requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
              (7) Detergent tank transitioning defenses. The commingling of two detergents in the same detergent storage tank will not be deemed to violate or cause violations of any of the provisions of this subpart, provided the following conditions are met:

              (i) The commingling must occur during a legitimate detergent transitioning event, i.e., a shift from the use of one detergent to another through the delivery of the new detergent into the same tank that contains the original detergent; and
              (ii) Any use restrictions applicable to the new detergent's certification also apply to the combined detergents; and
              (iii) The commingling event must be documented, either on the VAR formula record or on attached supporting records; and

              (iv) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in § 80.170, a VAR formula record must be created for the combined detergents. The VAR compliance period must begin no later than the time of the commingling event. However, at the blender's option, the compliance period may begin earlier, thus including use of the uncombined original detergent within the same period, provided that the 31-day limitation pursuant to § 80.170(a)(6) is not exceeded; and
              (v) The VAR formula record must also satisfy the requirements in one of the following paragraphs (c)(7)(v) (A) through (C) of this section, whichever applies to the commingling event. If neither paragraph (c)(7)(v) (A) nor (B) of this section initially applies, then the blender may drain and subsequently redeliver the original detergent into the tank in restricted amounts, in order to meet the conditions of paragraph (c)(7)(v) (A) or (B) of this section. Otherwise, the blender must comply with paragraph (c)(7)(v)(C) of this section.
              (A) If both detergents have the same LAC, and the original detergent accounts for no more than 20 percent of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent.
              (B) If the two detergents have different LACs and the original detergent accounts for 10 percent or less of the tank's total delivered volume after addition of the new detergent, then the VAR formula record is required to identify only the use of the new detergent, and must attain the LAC of the new detergent. If the original detergent's LAC is greater than that of the new detergent, then the compliance period may begin earlier than the date of the commingling event (pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section) only if the original detergent does not exceed 10 percent of the total detergent used during the compliance period.
              (C) If neither of the preceding paragraphs (c)(7)(v) (A) or (B) of this section applies, then the VAR formula record must identify both of the commingled detergents, and must use and attain the higher LAC of the two detergents. Once the commingled detergent has been depleted by an amount equal to the volume of the original detergent in the tank at the time the new detergent was added, subsequent VAR formula records must identify and use the LAC of only the new detergent.
              (8) Transition from noncertified to certified detergent. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in §§ 80.161(a)(3) and 80.168, after June 30, 1997, the addition to gasoline or PRC of a detergent which has not been certified pursuant to § 80.161 shall not be deemed to violate or cause violations of provisions of this subpart, provided that all of the following conditions are met:
              (i) The detergent was received by the detergent blender prior to July 1, 1997 and is used prior to January 1, 1998. Documentation which supports these dates must be maintained for at least five years and must be available for EPA's inspection upon request;
              (ii) The detergent is added to gasoline or PRC only in combination with a certified detergent and, at any one time, accounts for no more than 10 percent of the detergent tank's delivered volume;
              (iii) The total volume of detergent added to the gasoline or PRC is sufficient to attain the LAC of the certified detergent; and
              (iv) Use restrictions associated with the certified detergent are adhered to.
              (9) Procedures for curing use restrictions. In the case of a fuel product which has been additized with a detergent under the conditions of a use-restricted certification (pursuant to § 80.163), the use restriction can be negated (“cured”) by application of the procedures in this paragraph (c)(9). A party shall not be liable for violations of § 80.168(a) or (e) caused solely by the additization or subsequent use of gasoline or PRC in violation of such use restriction, provided that the following steps and conditions are applied before EPA has identified the nonconformity and prior to the sale or transfer of nonconforming product to the ultimate consumer:

              (i) Additional detergent must be added in sufficient quantity to provide effective deposit control, taking into account both the amount of detergent previously added and the final anticipated volume and composition of the subject fuel product.
              
              (ii) The additional detergent may be either the original detergent or a different detergent, so long as the additional detergent has been separately certified both for use with the subject fuel product and for use with the type of fuel product associated with the restriction which the party wishes to negate by the curing procedure. Detergents which have not been separately certified for both types of fuel products are not eligible to be used for this curing procedure.

              (iii) If a fuel product has been detergent additized under the conditions of a use-restricted certification which would preclude the addition of an oxygenate or other PRC, then such oxygenate or other PRC may nevertheless be added to that fuel product under this curing procedure, provided that additional eligible detergent is added, in an amount which equals or exceeds the number of gallons (DA) derived from the following equation:
              
              Additional Detergent Volume = DA = Vp(LAC2 − LAC1) + V(1 − p)LAC2
              
              
              
                where:
                
                V = Final volume of fuel product (in gallons)
                p = Fraction of final fuel product composed of the original (uncombined) fuel product
                LAC2 = Detergent's LAC certified for the final combined fuel product (in gallons of detergent per 1,000 gallons of fuel product)
                LAC1 = Detergent's LAC certified for the original (uncombined) fuel product (in gallons of detergent per 1,000 gallons of fuel product)
              
              

              (iv) In other instances in which gasoline or PRC has been additized in violation of a detergent use restriction, and no additional fuel components are to be added, such use restriction can be cured by the addition of eligible detergent in an amount which equals or exceeds the number of gallons (DA) derived from the following equation, which is a simplified version of the previous equation:
              
              Additional Detergent Volume = DA = V(LAC2 − LAC1)
              
              
                where:
                
                V = Volume of fuel product (in gallons) to be cured of the use restriction
                LAC2 = Detergent's LAC certified for the fuel product without the use restriction (in gallons of detergent per 1,000 gallons of fuel product)
                LAC1 = Detergent's LAC certified for the fuel product with the use restriction to be cured (in gallons of detergent per 1,000 gallons of fuel product)
              
              
              (v) In all such instances, a curing VAR must be created and maintained, which documents the use of the appropriate equation as specified above, and otherwise complies with the requirements of § 80.170(f)(6).

              § 80.170
              Volumetric additive reconciliation (VAR), equipment calibration, and recordkeeping requirements.

              This section contains requirements for automated detergent blending facilities and hand-blending detergent facilities. All gasoline and all PRC intended for use in gasoline must be additized unless otherwise noted in supporting VAR records, and must be accounted for in VAR records. The VAR reconciliation standard is attained under this section when the actual concentration of detergent used per VAR formula record equals or exceeds the applicable LAC certified for that detergent pursuant to § 80.161(b)(3)(ix) or, if appropriate, § 80.161(d). If a given detergent package has been certified under more than one certification option pursuant to § 80.163, then a separate VAR formula record must be created for gasoline or PRC additized on the basis of each certification and its respective LAC. In such cases, the amount of the detergent used under different certification options must be accurately and separately measured, either through the use of a separate storage tank, a separate meter, or some other measurement system that is able to accurately distinguish its use. Recorded volumes of gasoline, detergent, and PRC must be expressed to the nearest gallon (or smaller units), except that detergent volumes of five gallons or less must be expressed to the nearest tenth of a gallon (or smaller units). However, if the blender's equipment cannot accurately measure to the nearest tenth of a gallon, then such volumes must be rounded downward to the next lower gallon. PRC included in the reconciliation must be identified. Each VAR formula record must also contain the following information:
              (a) Automated blending facilities. In the case of an automated detergent blending facility, for each VAR period, for each detergent storage system and each detergent in that storage system, the following must be recorded:
              (1) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the detergent additive package being reconciled, the LAC, and any use restriction applicable to the LAC. The LAC must be expressed in terms of gallons of detergent per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, and expressed to four digits. If the detergent storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.
              (2) The total volume of detergent blended into gasoline and PRC, in accordance with one of the following paragraphs (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
              (i) For a facility which uses in-line meters to measure detergent usage, the total volume of detergent measured, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter readings for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.

              (ii) For a facility which uses a gauge to measure the inventory of the detergent storage tank, the total volume of detergent shall be calculated from the following equation:
              
              Detergent Volume = (A) − (B) + (C) − (D)
              
              
                where:
                
                A = Initial detergent inventory of the tank
                B = Final detergent inventory of the tank
                C = Sum of any additions to detergent inventory
                D = Sum of any withdrawals from detergent inventory for purposes other than the additization of gasoline or PRC.
              
              
              The value of each variable in this equation must be separately recorded on the VAR formula record. In addition, a list of each detergent addition included in variable C and a list of each detergent withdrawal included in variable D must be provided, either on the formula record or as VAR supporting documentation.
              (3) The total volume of gasoline plus PRC to which detergent has been added, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter measurements for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. If gasoline has intentionally been overadditized in anticipation of the later addition of unadditized PRC, then the total volume of gasoline plus PRC recorded must include the expected amount of unadditized PRC to be added later. In addition, the amount of gasoline which was overadditized for this purpose must be specified.
              (4) The actual detergent concentration, calculated as the total volume of detergent added (pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section), divided by the total volume of gasoline plus PRC (pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four digits.
              (5) A list of each detergent concentration rate initially set for the detergent that is the subject of the VAR record, together with the date and description of each adjustment to any initially set concentration. The concentration adjustment information may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. No concentration setting is permitted below the applicable certified LAC, except as may be modified pursuant to § 80.161(d) or as described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

              (6) The dates of the VAR period, which shall be no longer than thirty-one days. If the VAR period is contemporaneous with a calendar month, then specifying the month will fulfill this requirement; if not, then the beginning and ending dates and times of the VAR period must be listed. The times may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in supporting documentation. Any adjustment to any detergent concentration rate more than 10 percent over the concentration rate initially set in the VAR period shall terminate that VAR period and initiate a new VAR period, except as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
              (7) The concentration setting for a detergent injector may be set below the applicable LAC, or it may be adjusted more than 10 percent above the concentration initially set in the VAR period without terminating that VAR period, provided that:
              (i) The purpose of the change is to correct a batch misadditization prior to the end of the VAR period and prior to the transfer of the batch to another party, or to correct an equipment malfunction; and
              (ii) The concentration is immediately returned after the correction to a concentration that fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (a) (5) and (6) of this section; and
              (iii) The blender creates and maintains documentation establishing the date and adjustments of the correction; and
              (iv) If the correction is initiated only to rectify an equipment malfunction, and the amount of detergent used in this procedure is not added to gasoline within the compliance period, then this amount is subtracted from the detergent volume listed on the VAR formula record.
              (8) If unadditized gasoline has been transferred from the facility, other than bulk transfers from refineries or pipelines to non-retail outlets or non-WPC facilities, the total amount of such gasoline must be specified.
              (b) Non-automated facilities. In the case of a facility in which hand blending or any other non-automated method is used to blend detergent, for each detergent and for each batch of gasoline and each batch of PRC to which the detergent is being added, the following shall be recorded:
              (1) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the detergent additive package being reconciled, the LAC, and any use restriction applicable to the LAC. The LAC must be expressed in terms of gallons of detergent per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC, and expressed to four digits.
              (2) The date of the additization that is the subject of the VAR formula record.
              (3) The volume of added detergent.
              (4) The volume of the gasoline and/or PRC to which the detergent has been added. If gasoline has intentionally been overadditized in anticipation of the later addition of unadditized PRC, then the total volume of gasoline plus PRC recorded must include the expected amount of unadditized PRC to be added later. In addition, the amount of gasoline which was overadditized for this purpose must be specified.
              (5) The brand (if known), grade, and leaded/unleaded status of gasoline, and/or the type of PRC.
              (6) The actual detergent concentration, calculated as the volume of added detergent (pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section), divided by the volume of gasoline and/or PRC (pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four digits.
              (c) Every VAR formula record created pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall contain the following:
              (1) The signature of the creator of the VAR record;
              (2) The date of the creation of the VAR record; and
              (3) A certification of correctness by the creator of the VAR record.
              (d) Electronically-generated VAR formula and supporting records.

              (1) Electronically-generated records are acceptable for VAR formula records and supporting documentation (including PTDs), provided that they are complete, accessible, and easily readable. VAR formula records must also be stored with access and audit security, which must restrict to a limited number of specified people those who have the ability to alter or delete the records. In addition, parties maintaining records electronically must make available to EPA the hardware and software necessary to review the records.
              
              (2) Electronically-generated VAR formula records may use an electronic user identification code to satisfy the signature requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, provided that:
              (i) The use of the ID is limited to the record creator; and
              (ii) A paper record is maintained, which is signed and dated by the VAR formula record creator, acknowledging that the use of that particular user ID on a VAR formula record is equivalent to his/her signature on the document.
              (e) Automated detergent blenders must calibrate their detergent equipment once in each calendar half year, with the acceptable calibrations being no less than one hundred twenty days apart. Equipment recalibration is also required each time the detergent package is changed, unless written documentation indicates that the new detergent package has the same viscosity as the previous detergent package. Detergent package change calibrations may be used to satisfy the semiannual requirement provided that the calibrations occur in the appropriate half calendar year and are no less than one hundred twenty days apart.
              (f) The following VAR supporting documentation must also be created and maintained:
              (1) For all automated detergent blending facilities, documentation reflecting performance of the calibrations required by paragraph (e) of this section, and any associated adjustments of the automated detergent equipment;
              (2) For all hand-blending facilities which are terminals, a record specifying, for each VAR period, the total volume in gallons of transfers from the facility of unadditized base gasoline;
              (3) For all detergent blending facilities, product transfer documents for all gasoline, detergent and detergent-additized PRC transferred into or out of the facility; in addition, bills of lading, transfer, or sale for all unadditized PRC transferred into the facility;
              (4) For all automated detergent blending facilities, documentation establishing the brands (if known) and grades of the gasoline which is the subject of the VAR formula record; and
              (5) For all hand blending detergent blenders, the documentation, if in the party's possession, supporting the volumes of gasoline, PRC, and detergent reported on the VAR formula record.
              (6) For all detergent blending facilities, documentation establishing the curing of a batch or amount of misadditized gasoline or PRC, or the curing of a use restriction on the additized gasoline or PRC, and providing at least the following information: the date of the curing procedure; the problem that was corrected; the amount, name, and LAC of the original detergent used; the amount, name, and LAC of the added curing detergent; and the actual detergent concentration attained in, and the volume of, the total cured product.
              (g) Document retention and availability. All detergent blenders shall retain the documents required under this section for a period of five years from the date the VAR formula records and supporting documentation are created, and shall deliver them upon request to the EPA Administrator or the Administrator's authorized representative.
              (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, automated detergent blender facilities and hand-blender facilities which are terminals, which physically blend detergent into gasoline, must make immediately available to EPA, upon request, the preceding twelve months of VAR formula records plus the preceding two months of VAR supporting documentation.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, other hand-blending detergent facilities which physically blend detergent into gasoline must make immediately available to EPA, upon request, the preceding two months of VAR formula records and VAR supporting documentation.
              (3) Facilities which have centrally maintained records at other locations, or have customers who maintain their own records at other locations for their proprietary detergent systems, and which can document this fact to the Agency, may have until the start of the next business day after the EPA request to supply VAR supporting documentation, or longer if approved by the Agency.
              (4) In this paragraph (g) of this section, the term immediately available
                means that the records must be provided, electronically or otherwise, within approximately one hour of EPA's request, or within a longer time frame as approved by EPA.

              § 80.171
              Product transfer documents (PTDs).
              (a) Contents. For each occasion when any gasoline refiner, importer, reseller, distributor, carrier, retailer, wholesale purchaser-consumer, oxygenate blender, detergent manufacturer, distributor, carrier, or blender, transfers custody or title to any gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC other than when detergent-additized gasoline is sold or dispensed at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility to the ultimate consumer, the transferor shall provide to the transferee, and the transferee shall acquire from the transferor, documents which accurately include the following information:
              (1) The name and address of the transferee and transferor; the address requirement may be fulfilled, in the alternative, through separate documentation which establishes said addresses and is maintained by the parties and made available to EPA for the same length of time as required for the PTDs, provided that the normal business procedure of these parties is not to identify addresses on PTDs.
              (2) The date of the transfer.
              (3) The volume of product transferred.

              (4)(i) The identity of the product being transferred (i.e., its identity as base gasoline, detergent, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized oxygenate or detergent-additized gasoline blending stock that comprises a detergent-additized PRC). PTDs for detergent-additized gasoline or PRC are not required to identify the particular detergent used to additize the product.

              (ii) If the product being transferred consists of two or more different types of product subject to this regulation, i.e., base gasoline, detergent-additized gasoline, or specified detergent-additized PRC, component, then the PTD for the commingled product must identify each such type of component contained in the commingled product.
              (5) If the product being transferred is base gasoline, then in addition to the base gasoline identification, the following warning must be stated on the PTD: “Not for sale to the ultimate consumer”. If, pursuant to § 80.173(a), the product being transferred is exempt base gasoline to be used for research, development, or test purposes only, the following warning must also be stated on the PTD: “For use in research, development, and test programs only”.
              (6) The name of the detergent additive as reported in its registration must be used to identify the detergent package on its PTD.
              (7) If the product being transferred is leaded gasoline, then the PTD must disclose that the product contains lead and/or phosphorous, as applicable.
              (8) If the product being transferred is gasoline or PRC that has been additized with detergent under a PADD-specific or CARB-based certification, or under a certification option which creates an oxygenate or PRC use restriction, then the PTD for the additized product must identify the applicable use restriction. The PTD for commingled additized gasolines or PRCs containing such restrictions must indicate the applicable restriction(s) from each component.
              (9) If the product being transferred is detergent-additized gasoline or PRC that has been overadditized in anticipation of the later (or earlier) addition of PRC, then the PTD must include a statement that the product has been overadditized to account for a specified volume in gallons, or a specified percentage of the product's total volume, of additional, specified PRC.
              (10) If a detergent package has been certified under only one certification option, and that option places a use restriction on the respective LAC, then the PTD must identify the detergent as use-restricted; the PTD for a detergent package certified with more than one LAC must identify that the detergent has special use options available.
              (11) Base gasoline designated for fuel-specific certification.

              (i) The PTD for segregated base gasoline intended for additization with a specific fuel-specific detergent pursuant to § 80.163(c) must indicate that it is for use with the designated, fuel-specific detergent.
              (ii) A PTD for base gasoline may not indicate that the product is for use with a designated, fuel-specific detergent, unless the entire quantity of base gasoline is from the segregated fuel supply specified in the detergent's certification and the gasoline contains only those oxygenates or PRCs, if any, specified and approved in the detergent's certification.
              (iii) If, pursuant to § 80.163(c)(3), the fuel-specific certification for the segregated pool of gasoline has established that no detergent additives are necessary for such gasoline to comply with this subpart, then the PTD must identify this gasoline as detergent-equivalent gasoline.
              (b) Use of product codes and other non-regulatory language. (1) Product codes and other non-regulatory language may not be used as a substitute for the specified PTD warning language specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for base gasoline, except that:
              (i) The specified warning language may be omitted for bulk transfers of base gasoline from a refinery to a pipeline if there is a prior written agreement between the parties specifying that all such gasoline is unadditized and will not be transferred to the ultimate consumer;
              (ii) Product codes may be used as a substitute for the specified warning language provided that the PTD is an electronic data interchange (EDI) document being used solely for the transfer of title to the base gasoline, and provided that the product codes otherwise comply with the requirements of this section.
              (2) Product codes and other non-regulatory language may not be used in place of the PTD language specified in paragraph (a)(11) of this section regarding detergent package use restrictions.
              (3) Product codes and other language not specified in this section may otherwise be used to comply with PTD information requirements, provided that they are clear, accurate, and not misleading.
              (4) If product codes are used, they must be standardized throughout the distribution system in which they are used, and downstream parties must be informed of their full meaning.
              (c) PTD exemption for small transfers of additized gasoline. Transfers of additized gasoline are exempt from the PTD requirements of this section provided all the following conditions are satisfied:
              (1) The product is being transferred by a distributor who is not the product's detergent blender; and
              (2) The recipient is a wholesale purchaser-consumer (WPC) or other ultimate consumer of gasoline, for its own use only or for that of its agents or employees; and
              (3) The volume of additized gasoline being transferred is no greater than 550 gallons.
              (d) Recordkeeping Period. Any person creating, providing or acquiring product transfer documentation for gasoline, detergent, or detergent-additized PRC shall retain the documents required by this section for a period of five years from the date the product transfer documentation was created, received or transferred, as applicable, and shall deliver such documents to EPA upon request. WPCs are not required to retain PTDs of additized gasoline received by them.

              Alternative certification test procedures and standards.

              This section specifies the deposit control test requirements and performance standards which must be met in order to certify detergent additives for use in unleaded gasoline pursuant to § 80.161(b)(1)(ii)(A)(2). These standards must be met in the context of the specific test procedures identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Testing must be conducted and the performance standards met when the subject detergent additive is mixed in a test fuels meeting all relevant requirements of § 80.177. Complete test documentation must be submitted by the certifying party within 30 days of receipt of a written request from EPA for such records.
              (a) Fuel injector deposit control testing. The required test fuel must produce no more than one inoperative injector when tested in accordance with the fuel injector deposit test procedure specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
              
              (b) Intake valve deposit control testing. The required test fuel must produce the accumulation of less than 50 mg of intake valve deposits on average when tested in accordance with ASTM D6201. ASTM D6201-04 (Reapproved 2009), “Standard Test Method for Dynamometer Evaluation of Unleaded Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel for Intake Valve Deposit Formation,” approved June 1, 2009, is incorporated by reference into this section with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

              (1) Tests conducted for the intake valve deposit demonstration test pursuant to § 80.177(b)(4) and to demonstrate compliance with the intake valve deposit control standards in this section must be conducted using the same engine block and cylinder head.
              (2) All results must be derived from operationally valid tests in accordance with the test validation criteria of ASTM D6201.
              (3) Test results shall be reported for individual intake valves and as an average of all intake valves.
              (c) Fuel injector deposit test procedure—(1) Summary of test procedure. After flushing the vehicle fuel system with the fuel to be tested and installing new injectors, an automatic starter control system starts the vehicle and lets it idle for five minutes. The engine is then shut off and allowed to soak for 25 minutes. This cycle is repeated for a total of 192 cycles (96 hours). During this time, the engine is kept at operating temperature with block heaters. After the 96 hours of start/soak cycles, the engine is allowed to hot-soak for 48 hours, during which time the engine is not started but is maintained at operating temperature. At the end of the 48-hour hot soak, the block heaters are turned off and the engine is allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. At the end of this 48-hour ambient temperature soak, an injector balance test is conducted to determine whether any poppet nozzles are stuck closed.
              (2) Facilities and equipment—(i) Location. A temperature-controlled garage or large room is needed. A dynamometer is not needed, since this test is an idle test. The room temperature shall be maintained in the range of 68-75 °F. The room shall be equipped with an exhaust system that connects to the vehicle tail pipe to remove the exhaust gases from the building. It is recommended that an interlock be provided so that if the building exhaust system fails, the vehicle test will shut down.
              (ii) Electrical power. Two 110-volt, 15-amp circuits are needed (20-amp circuits are recommended) to operate the four block heaters and a battery charger.
              (iii) Fuel drain facility. A facility is required to drain the fuel from the vehicle between tests. The fuel is drained from the service port on the fuel rail, near the back of the engine. A commercial cart equipped with a tank and a suction pump is recommended for this operation.
              (iv) Vehicle. A Chevrolet Astro or GMC Safari van, model year 1998-2001, shall be used for the test. Either two-wheel drive or all-wheel drive is satisfactory, although the former allows easier installation of the block heaters.
              
              (v) Injectors. New injectors, General Motors part number 17091432, shall be used for each test.
              (vi) Block heaters. Four block heaters, General Motors part number 12371293, are needed for each vehicle. Two heaters shall be installed on each side of the engine, in the freeze plug locations.
              (vii) Battery charger. Because of the large number of starts and the very short engine running time, a battery charger is needed. It is recommended that the charger be installed permanently on the vehicle and remain plugged in while the test is in progress.
              (viii) Starter controller. A system is needed to start the engine automatically and then shut it off after exactly five minutes of running. A commercial after-market remote starting system connected to a timer or computer can be used, or a one-of-a-kind system can be designed and built.
              (ix) Tech 2 analyzer. A General Motors Tech 2 analyzer, part number GM3000094, available from Kent-Moore, shall be used to conduct the injector balance test.
              (x) Fuel pressure gauge. A fuel pressure gauge capable of measuring fuel system pressure to the nearest 1 psi over the range of 45 to 65 psi, shall be used with the Tech 2 analyzer when conducting the injector balance test. A pressure transducer shall not be used.
              (xi) Gaskets. The upper intake manifold gasket and injector body gasket will need to be replaced from time to time as they crack, tear, or wear out from frequent handling during injector replacement.
              (3) Initial vehicle preparation—(i) Diagnostics. To help determine whether a vehicle is satisfactory for use in this injector test procedure, a thorough inspection and engine diagnostic test shall be conducted as described in the service manual. Check the cooling system to be sure the coolant looks clean and there are no signs of rust.
              (ii) Block heaters. Install four electric block heaters, General Motors part number 12371293, in the coolant passages of the engine block, two on each side of the block. The heaters will be plugged into a heater control unit. Two of the heaters will remain on at all times during the first 144 hours of the injector fouling test, while the other two heaters will be turned on and off by the controller as needed to maintain an engine temperature of about 100-102 °C during the soak periods of the test. (The temperature will drop while the engine is running, as the coolant from the radiator circulates through the engine. The temperature should recover to 100-102 °C within about 20 minutes after the engine shuts off.)
              (iii) Thermocouples. Install a 1/16-inch Type K thermocouple in a threaded bolt hole on the rear of the right cylinder head. This thermocouple provides the feedback signal to the controller to turn two block heaters on and off. Install another thermocouple in the other hole near the first thermocouple. This second thermocouple provides a signal to an over-temperature safety shut-off on the heater controller. If the engine temperature reaches the set point (110 °C recommended), the heater controller will signal the starter controller to shut down the test.
              (iv) Fuel system flush. Drain the fuel from the fuel system through the service port on the fuel rail at the back of the engine. Refuel with a non-detergent gasoline containing between 5 and 10 percent ethanol. Drive the vehicle for approximately 100 miles to thoroughly expose all parts of the fuel system to the fuel. The fuel pump and fuel filters should not be replaced unless there is a problem with them or if the vehicle history suggests that replacement would be prudent. If replacement is necessary, the new parts should first be conditioned by recirculating a 10% ethanol-gasoline blend (without deposit control additive) through them for one week.
              (v) Oil change. Change the engine oil and oil filter, using oil that meets the manufacturer's recommended service classification and viscosity grade.
              (vi) Battery charger. Install a battery charger in the vehicle so that it can be plugged in during the test and keep the battery at full charge.
              (vii) Radiator. Install cardboard or other suitable material on the front of the radiator to block the flow of air through the radiator while the engine is running. This will help minimize the drop in coolant temperature.
              (viii) Starter controller. Make the necessary changes to the vehicle electrical system so that the engine can be started and stopped automatically on a programmed schedule. Install a starter controller or computer and program it to do the following:
              (A) Start the engine and let it run for 5 minutes, and then shut it off and let it hot-soak for 25 minutes.
              (B) Repeat the 5/25 cycle for a total of 192 cycles.
              (C) Allow a 48-hr hot soak during which the engine is not run but the engine temperature is maintained at 100-102 °C.
              (D) Turn off the heaters for 48 hours.
              (E) Continuously count and display the number of cycles that have been completed throughout the test.
              (4) Test procedure. The steps described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) though (vi) of this section must be performed by the action described in paragraph (c)(3)(vii) of this section so that the new injectors are exposed only to the new test fuel. Take the following additional steps:
              (i) Drain the fuel from the vehicle.
              (ii) Add approximately 2 gallons of the fuel to be tested.
              (iii) Drive the vehicle for approximately 20 miles at speeds up to approximately 50-60 mph. Approximately every 5 miles, stop the vehicle and moderately accelerate. If the radiator covering is still in place, watch the temperature gauge during the driving and avoid overheating the engine. This step not only flushes the fuel system but also helps remove carbon (if any) from the spark plugs and water from the exhaust system.
              (iv) Drain the fuel from the vehicle and add approximately 1 to 2 gallons of the fuel to be tested.
              (v) Drive the vehicle for approximately 5 miles. Watch the temperature gauge and avoid overheating the engine.
              (vi) Drain the fuel from the vehicle and add approximately 10 gallons of the fuel to be tested. (The test consumes about 7.5 gallons of fuel.)
              (vii) Remove the fuel injectors and install new injectors. Run the engine for a few minutes to be sure it runs properly.
              (viii) Park the vehicle in the location where the test will be run.
              (ix) Connect the vehicle tail pipe to the building exhaust system.
              (x) Depending on the design of the starter control system, remove fuses and relays as necessary and connect the wires from the controller to the vehicle fuse box. Close the hood.
              (xi) Turn on the vehicle ignition switch and the security bypass switch if so equipped.
              (xii) Turn on the heater controller and be sure that it is working.
              (xiii) Turn on the starter controller and the vehicle should start.
              (xiv) Monitor the engine temperature for the first few cycles to be sure it is increasing.
              (xv) At the end of the 192-hour (8-day) test, turn off the ignition switch, starter controller, and heater controller. Return the fuses, relays, and wires to their standard configuration for normal operation of the vehicle.
              (xvi) Connect the Tech 2 analyzer to the ALDL connector under the instrument panel, and connect the fuel pressure gauge to the service port on the fuel rail at the back of the engine.
              (xvii) Conduct the injector balance test by following the instructions on the Tech 2. The injector balance test checks each injector individually to determine whether the poppet nozzle is stuck closed. First, the Tech 2 turns on the fuel pump momentarily to pressurize the fuel system. Then it pulses the injector for a preset interval. If the injector and poppet nozzle are working properly, the fuel system pressure will decrease gradually and smoothly by about 8 to 10 psi during the pulsing. If the pressure does not decrease, or decreases very suddenly but then stops decreasing before the pulsing is done, the poppet is stuck closed. This procedure, beginning with pressurizing the fuel system, is carried out for each injector.

                (2) The sulfur standards and all compliance calculations for sulfur under this subpart are in parts per million (ppm) and volumes are in gallons.
                (3) The averaging period is January 1 through December 31 of each year.
                (4) The standards under this paragraph (a) for all imported gasoline shall be met by the importer.
                (b)(1) The refinery or importer annual average gasoline sulfur standard is the maximum average sulfur level allowed for gasoline produced at a refinery or imported by an importer during each calendar year starting January 1, 2005.
                (2) The annual average sulfur level is calculated in accordance with § 80.205.

The same allotments used to demonstrate compliance with the corporate pool average standard may be used by a refinery in the corporate pool toward a demonstration of compliance with the refinery average standard, or by an importer for demonstration of compliance with the importer average standard. Alternatively, some of the allotments may be used toward a demonstration of compliance with the refinery average standard by one refinery in the corporate pool and the remainder used by another refinery or refineries in the corporate pool.
                (c)(1) The corporate pool average gasoline sulfur standards applicable in 2004 and 2005 are the maximum average sulfur levels allowed for a refiner's or importer's gasoline production from all of the refiner's refineries or all gasoline imported by an importer in a calendar year. The corporate pool average standards for a party that is both a refiner and an importer are the maximum average sulfur levels allowed for all the party's combined gasoline production from all refineries and imported gasoline in a calendar year.
                (2) The corporate pool average is calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 80.205.
                (3) The corporate pool average standard may be met using sulfur allotments under § 80.275.
                (4) The corporate pool average standards do not apply to approved small refiners subject to the gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.240.
                (5)(i) Joint ventures, in which two or more parties collectively own and operate one or more refineries, will be treated as a separate refiner under this section.
                (ii) One partner to a joint venture may include one or more joint venture refineries in its corporate pool for purposes of complying with the corporate pool average standards. The joint venture will be in compliance for such joint venture refinery(ies) if the partner's corporate pool average meets the corporate pool average standards. The joint venture entity must demonstrate compliance with the corporate pool average standards for any refinery(ies) owned by the joint venture that are not included in one partner's corporate pool.

                (iii) In the case of a refinery that is owned by a two or more parties that is not a joint venture under this paragraph (c)(5), the business entity consisting of the joint owners is the refiner of that refinery. One of the owners of such a refinery may include the refinery in its corporate pool for purposes of complying with the corporate pool average standards under this section, with the same requirements and limitations that apply under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.
                (6)(i) A parent company is the refiner of any refinery facilities owned by the parent company's wholly-owned subsidiaries for purposes of compliance with the corporate pool average standards under this section.
                (ii) A parent company must include in its corporate pool all of the gasoline produced at any refineries owned by the parent company and any refineries owned by the parent company's wholly-owned subsidiaries; or
                (iii) A parent company may be deemed in compliance with the corporate pool average standards if the parent company includes in its corporate pool the gasoline produced by any refineries owned by the parent company, and each wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent company individually complies with the corporate pool average standards for the gasoline produced at the refineries owned by the wholly-owned subsidiary.
                (d)(1) The per-gallon cap standard is the maximum sulfur level allowed for each batch of gasoline produced or imported starting January 1, 2004.
                (2) In 2004 only, a refiner or importer may produce or import gasoline with a per-gallon sulfur content greater than 300 ppm, to a maximum of 350 ppm, provided the following conditions are met:

                (i) The refinery or importer becomes subject to an adjusted per-gallon cap standard in 2005, calculated using the following formula:
                
                ACS = 300−(Smax−300)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  ACS = Adjusted cap standard.
                  Smax = Maximum sulfur content of any gasoline produced at a refinery or imported by an importer during 2004.
                
                
                (ii) The adjusted cap standard calculated under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section applies to all gasoline produced at a refinery or imported by an importer during 2005.
                (iii) The refinery or importer remains subject to the 30.00 average standard under paragraph (a) of this section for 2005.
                (iv) The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2) apply to gasoline designated as GPA gasoline under § 80.219(a).
                (v) The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2) do not apply to small refiners as defined in § 80.225.

                § 80.205
                How is the annual refinery or importer average and corporate pool average sulfur level determined?
                (a) The annual refinery or importer average and corporate pool average gasoline sulfur level is calculated as follows:
                
                  
                  ER10FE00.007
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Sa = The refinery or importer annual average sulfur level, or corporate pool average level, as applicable.
                  Vi = The volume of gasoline produced or imported in batch i.
                  Si = The sulfur content of batch i determined under § 80.330.
                  n = The number of batches of gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period.
                  i = Individual batch of gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period.
                
                
                (b) All annual refinery or importer average or corporate pool average calculations shall be conducted to two decimal places.
                (c) A refiner or importer may include oxygenate added downstream from the refinery or import facility when calculating the sulfur content, provided the following requirements are met:
                (1) For oxygenate added to conventional gasoline, the refiner or importer must comply with the requirements of § 80.101(d)(4)(ii).
                (2) For oxygenate added to RBOB, the refiner or importer must comply with the requirements of § 80.69(a).
                (d) Refiners and importers must exclude from compliance calculations all of the following:
                (1) Gasoline that was not produced at the refinery;

                § 80.210
                What sulfur standards apply to gasoline downstream from refineries and importers?
                The sulfur standard for gasoline at any point in the gasoline distribution system downstream from refineries and import facilities, including gasoline at facilities of distributors, carriers, oxygenate blenders, retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers (“downstream location”), shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section.
                (a) Definition. S-RGAS means gasoline that is subject to the standards under § 80.240 or § 80.270, including Certified Sulfur-FRGAS as defined in § 80.410, except that no batch of gasoline may be classified as S-RGAS if the actual sulfur content is less than the applicable per-gallon refinery cap standard specified in § 80.195.
                (b) Standards for gasoline that does not qualify for S-RGAS downstream standards. The following standards apply to any gasoline that does not qualify for S-RGAS downstream standards under in paragraph (d) of this section:
                (1) Starting February 1, 2004 the sulfur content of gasoline at any downstream location other than at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility, and starting March 1, 2004 the sulfur content of gasoline at any downstream location, shall not exceed 378 ppm.

                (2) Except as provided in § 80.220(a), starting February 1, 2005 the sulfur content of gasoline at any downstream location other than at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility, and starting March 1, 2005 the sulfur content of gasoline at any downstream location, shall not exceed 326 ppm.
                
                (3) Except as provided in § 80.220(a), starting February 1, 2006 the sulfur content of gasoline at any downstream location other than at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility, and starting March 1, 2006 the sulfur content of gasoline at any downstream location, shall not exceed 95 ppm.
                (c) Standards for gasoline that qualifies for S-RGAS downstream standards. In the case of any gasoline that qualifies for S-RGAS downstream standards under paragraph (d) of this section, the sulfur standard shall be the downstream standard for the gasoline calculated under paragraph (f) of this section. In the case of mixtures of gasoline that qualify for different S-RGAS downstream standards, the sulfur standard shall be the highest downstream standard applicable to any of the S-RGAS in the mixture.
                (d) Gasoline that qualifies for S-RGAS downstream standards. Gasoline qualifies for S-RGAS downstream standards if all of the following conditions are met:
                (1) The gasoline must be comprised in whole or part of S-RGAS.
                (2) Product transfer documents applicable to the gasoline when received at that location must represent that the gasoline contains S-RGAS.
                (3) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the gasoline must have been sampled and tested at that location subsequent to the most recent receipt of gasoline at that location, and the test result must show a sulfur content greater than:
                (i) 350 ppm starting February 1, 2004;
                (ii) 300 ppm starting February 1, 2005; and
                (iii) 80 ppm (or in the GPA, 300 ppm) starting February 1, 2006.
                (4) This sampling and testing condition does not apply for gasoline at any retail outlet, wholesale purchaser-consumer facility, or contained in any transport truck.
                (e) Product transfer document information for S-RGAS. (1) On each occasion when any refiner or importer of S-RGAS transfers custody or title to such gasoline, the refiner or importer shall provide to the transferee documents that include the following information:
                (i) Identification of the gasoline as being S-RGAS; and
                (ii) The downstream standard applicable to the batch of gasoline under paragraph (f) of this section.
                (2) Where gasoline in whole or part is classified as S-RGAS when received by the transferor, and where the gasoline transferred meets the conditions under paragraph (d) of this section, the transferor shall provide to the transferee, on each occasion when custody or title to gasoline is transferred, documents that include the following information:
                (i) Identification of the gasoline as S-RGAS; and
                (ii) The applicable downstream standard under paragraph (c) of this section. This does not apply when gasoline is sold or dispensed for use in motor vehicles at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility.
                (3) No person shall classify gasoline as being S-RGAS except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
                (4) Product codes may be used to convey the information required by paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section if such codes are clearly understood by each transferee.
                (5) Gasoline from a terminal tank containing S-RGAS that is combined with gasoline from a terminal tank containing non-S-RGAS for the purpose of blending mid-grade gasoline in a transport truck may be classified on product transfer documents as S-RGAS, provided that the S-RGAS was combined with non-S-RGAS for the sole purpose of producing midgrade gasoline.

                (6) Where S-RGAS is being delivered into a terminal storage tank containing non-S-RGAS which is simultaneously supplying gasoline to a transport truck, the terminal may identify the gasoline as S-RGAS before the delivery into the terminal tank is complete without performing the tests required in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Upon completion of the delivery of S-RGAS into the terminal tank, the terminal may classify the gasoline as S-RGAS only if it meets the criteria for S-RGAS following testing in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
                
                (7) The information relating to S-RGAS required to be included in product transfer documentation under this paragraph (e) must be included in the product transfer documents which accompany the transfer of custody of the gasoline. Product transfer documents that transfer title of the gasoline may fulfill the requirements under this paragraph (e) by indicating that the required information relating to S-RGAS is contained in the product transfer documents which accompany the transfer of custody of the gasoline.
                (f) Downstream standards applicable to S-RGAS when produced or imported. (1) The downstream standard applicable to any gasoline classified as S-RGAS when produced or imported shall be calculated using the following equation:
                
                D = S + 105 × ((S + 2)/104)0.4
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  D = Downstream sulfur standard.
                  S = The sulfur content of the refiner's batch determined under § 80.330.
                
                
                (2) Where more than one S-RGAS batch is combined, prior to shipment, at the refinery or import facility where the S-RGAS is produced or imported, the downstream standard applicable to the mixture shall be the highest downstream standard, calculated under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, for any S-RGAS contained in the mixture.

                Transmix processors and transmix blenders, as defined in § 80.84(a), may comply with the following requirements instead of the requirements and standards otherwise applicable to a refiner under subpart H of this part.
                (a) Any transmix processor who recovers transmix gasoline product (TGP), as defined in § 80.84(a), from transmix through transmix processing under § 80.84(c) must show through sampling and testing, using the methods in § 80.330, that the TGP meets the applicable sulfur standards under § 80.210 or § 80.220, prior to the TGP leaving the transmix processing facility.
                (1) The applicable sulfur standard is the standard in § 80.210(b); or
                (2) If the TGP sulfur is greater than the standard in § 80.210(b), and the transmix processor has product transfer documents that prove the TGP was originally produced by a small refiner, hardship refiner, or for use in the GPA, the applicable sulfur standard for the TGP is the downstream sulfur standard corresponding to the original gasoline.
                (b) The sampling and testing required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be conducted following each occasion TGP is produced.
                (c) Any transmix processor who produces gasoline by adding blendstock to TGP must, for such blendstock, comply with all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under subpart H of this part, and must meet the applicable downstream sulfur standards under § 80.210 or § 80.220 for the gasoline produced by blending blendstock and TGP, prior to the gasoline leaving the transmix processing facility.

                (d) Any transmix processor who produces gasoline by blending blendstock into TGP may meet the sampling and testing requirements of subpart H of this part as follows:
                
                (1)(i) Sample and test the blendstock when received at the transmix processing facility, using the methods specified in § 80.330, to determine the volume and sulfur content, and treat each volume of blendstock that is blended into a volume of TGP as a separate batch for purposes of calculating and reporting compliance with the applicable annual average and per-gallon cap sulfur standards in § 80.195 or § 80.216, as applicable; or
                (ii) Use sulfur test results of the blendstock supplier provided that the following requirements are met:
                (A) Sampling and testing by the blendstock supplier is performed using the methods specified in § 80.330;
                (B) Testing for the sulfur content of the blendstock in the supplier's storage tank must be conducted subsequent to the last receipt of blendstock into the supplier's storage tank from which the transmix processor is supplied;
                (C) The transmix processor must obtain a copy of the blendstock supplier's test results, at the time of each transfer of blendstock to the transmix processor, that reflect the sulfur content of each load of blendstock supplied to the transmix processor;
                (D) The transmix processor must conduct a quality assurance program of sampling and testing for each blendstock supplier. The frequency of blendstock sampling and testing must be one sample for every 500,000 gallons of blendstock received or one sample every 3 months, whichever results in more frequent sampling; and
                (E) If any of the requirements of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii) are not met, in whole or in part, for any blendstock blended into TGP, that blendstock is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur standards in § 80.195.
                (2) Sample and test each batch of gasoline produced by blending blendstock into TGP, using the methods specified in § 80.330, to determine the sulfur content of the batch.
                (3) The sulfur content of each batch of gasoline produced by blending blendstock into TGP must be no greater than the downstream sulfur standard under § 80.210 or § 80.220 applicable to the designation of the TGP; and
                (4) Gasoline produced by blending blendstock into TGP must be properly identified on product transfer documents in accordance with the provisions of § 80.210 or § 80.220, as applicable.
                (e) Any transmix blender who produces gasoline by blending transmix, or mixtures of gasoline and distillate fuel described in § 80.84(e), into previously certified gasoline under § 80.84(d) must meet the applicable downstream sulfur standards under § 80.210 or § 80.220 for the gasoline produced by blending transmix and previously certified gasoline.
                (f) Any transmix processor or transmix blender who adds feedstocks to their transmix other than gasoline, distillate fuel, or gasoline blendstocks from pipeline interface must meet all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under subpart H of this part, other than § 80.213, for all gasoline they produce during a compliance period.

                (ii) Employed an average of no more than 1,500 people, based on the average number of employees for all pay periods from January 1, 1998, to January 1, 1999; and
                (iii) Had an average crude capacity less than or equal to 155,000 barrels per calendar day (bpcd) for 1998.
                (2) For the purpose of determining the number of employees and crude capacity under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the refiner shall include the employees and crude capacity of any subsidiary companies, any parent company and subsidiaries of the parent company, and any joint venture partners. A subsidiary under this paragraph means any subsidiary in which the refiner or parent company has a 50% or greater ownership interest.
                (b) The definition under paragraph (a) of this section applies to domestic and foreign refiners. For any refiner owned by a governmental entity, the number of employees as specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall include all employees of the governmental entity.
                (c) If, without merger with, or acquisition of, another business unit, a company with approved small refiner status under § 80.235 exceeds 1,500 employees, or a corporate crude capacity of 155,000 bpcd after January 1, 1999, it will be considered a small refiner for the duration of the small refiner program.
                (d) Notwithstanding the definition in paragraph (a) of this section, refiners who acquire a refinery after January 1, 1999, or reactivate a refinery that was shutdown or was non-operational between January 1, 1998, and January 1, 1999, may apply for small refiner status in accordance with the provisions of § 80.235.

                § 80.230
                Who is not eligible for the hardship provisions for small refiners?
                (a) The following are not eligible for the hardship provisions for small refiners:
                (1) Refiners with refineries built after January 1, 1999;
                (2) Refiners who exceed the employee or crude oil capacity criteria under § 80.225(a) on January 1, 1999, but who meet these criteria after that date, regardless of whether the reduction in employees or crude capacity is due to operational changes at the refinery or a company sale or reorganization;
                (3) Importers; and
                (4) Refiners who produce gasoline other than by processing crude oil through refinery processing units.

                (b)(1)(i) Refiners who qualify as small under § 80.225 and subsequently cease production of diesel fuel from processing crude oil through refinery processing units, or employ more than 1,500 people or exceed the 155,000 bpcd crude oil capacity limit after January 1, 2004 as a result of merger with or acquisition of or by another entity, are disqualified as small refiners, except this shall not apply in the case of a merger between two previously approved small refiners. If disqualification occurs, the refiner shall notify EPA in writing no later than 20 days following this disqualifying event.
                (ii) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, any refiner whose status changes under this paragraph shall meet the applicable standards of § 80.195 within a period of up to 30 months of the disqualifying event for any of its refineries that were previously subject to the small refiner standards of § 80.240(a). However, such period shall not extend beyond December 31, 2007, or, for refineries for which the Administrator has approved an extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.553(c), December 31, 2010.
                (iii) A refiner may apply to EPA for an additional six months to comply with the standards of § 80.195 if more than 30 months will be required for the necessary engineering, permitting, construction, and start-up work to be completed. Such applications must include detailed technical information supporting the need for additional time. EPA will base its decision to approve additional time on the information provided by the refiner and on other relevant information. In no case will EPA extend the compliance date beyond December 31, 2007, or, for refineries for which the Administrator has approved an extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.553(c), December 31, 2010.
                (iv) During the period of time up to 30 months provided under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, and any extension provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the refiner may not generate gasoline sulfur credits under § 80.310.
                (2) Any refiner who qualifies as a small refiner under § 80.225 may elect to meet the standards under § 80.195 by notifying EPA in writing no later than November 15 prior to the year that the change will occur. Any refiner whose status changes under this paragraph (b)(2) shall meet the standards under § 80.195 beginning with the first averaging period subsequent to the status change.

                § 80.240
                What are the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards?
                (a) The gasoline sulfur standards for an approved small refiner are as follows:
                
                  
                    Refinery baseline sulfur level
                    Temporary sulfur standards for small refiners applicable from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2007

                (b) The refinery annual average sulfur standards must be met on an annual calendar year basis for each refinery owned by a small refiner. The refinery annual average sulfur level is calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 80.205.
                (c)(1) The refinery annual average standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section apply to the volume of gasoline produced by a small refiner's refinery up to the lesser of:
                (i) 105% of the baseline gasoline volume as determined under § 80.250(a)(1); or
                (ii) The volume of gasoline produced at that refinery during the averaging period by processing crude oil.
                (2) If a refiner exceeds the volume limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section during any averaging period, the annual average sulfur standard applicable to the refiner for that averaging period is calculated as follows:
                
                  
                  ER10FE00.008
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  Ssr = Small refiner annual average sulfur standard.
                  Vb = Applicable volume under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
                  Va = Averaging period gasoline volume.

                  AF = Adjustment factor (120 in 2004; 90 in 2005; and 30 in 2006 and thereafter).
                
                
                (3) The small refiner average standards under paragraph (a) of this section may be met using sulfur allotments or credits as provided under § 80.275 or § 80.315.
                (4) The provisions for compliance deficits under § 80.205(e) do not apply to small refiners subject to the standards under this section.
                (d) In the case of any refiner with small refiner status who generates sulfur allotments or credits pursuant to § 80.275(a) or § 80.305, the baseline applicable to that refiner's refinery for purposes of establishing the standard for the refinery under paragraph (a) of this section beginning in 2004 shall be the lowest annual average sulfur content for any year during the period in which the refiner generated allotments or credits.
                (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the temporary sulfur standards for small refiners may be extended as provided under § 80.553.
                (f)(1) In the case of a refiner without approved small refiner status who acquires a refinery from a refiner with approved small refiner status under § 80.235, the applicable small refiner standards under paragraph (a) of this section will apply to the acquired small refinery for a period up to 30 months from the date of acquisition of the refinery, but no later than December 31, 2007, or, for a refinery for which the Administrator has approved an extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.553(c), December 31, 2010, after which time the standards of § 80.195 shall apply to the acquired refinery.
                (2) A refiner may apply to EPA for an additional six months to comply with the standards of § 80.195 for the acquired refinery if more than 30 months will be required for the necessary engineering, permitting, construction, and start-up work to be completed. Such applications must include detailed technical information supporting the need for additional time. EPA will base its decision to approve additional time on information provided by the refiner and on other relevant information. In no case will EPA extend the compliance date beyond December 31, 2007, or, for a refinery for which the Administrator has approved an extension of the small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.553(c), December 31, 2010.

                § 80.245
                How does a small refiner apply for a sulfur baseline?
                (a) Any refiner seeking small refiner status must apply for a refinery sulfur baseline by the deadline under § 80.235 for each of the refiner's refineries by providing the following information:
                (1) A sulfur baseline and baseline volume for every refinery calculated in accordance with § 80.250.
                (2) The following information for each batch of gasoline produced in 1997-1998:
                (i) Batch number assigned to the batch under § 80.65(d) or § 80.101(i);
                (ii) Volume; and
                (iii) Sulfur content.

                (3) For any refiner that acquires and/or reactivates a refinery that was shut down or non-operational between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 1998, the average sulfur level and average volume of gasoline produced during each annual averaging period that the refinery was in operation after the refinery was acquired and/or reactivated. EPA will evaluate all of the information and data submitted by the refiner in determining the appropriate sulfur baseline for the refinery. Where EPA concludes that the data submitted reasonably reflects current sulfur levels, the refinery's baseline will be determined based on the average sulfur content of gasoline produced by the refinery during the most recent annual averaging period in which the refinery was in operation.
                
                (b) The sulfur baseline application must be submitted to the address specified in § 80.235(b).
                (c)(1) Foreign refiners who do not have an approved individual refinery baseline under § 80.94 must follow the procedures specified in § 80.410(b).
                (2) Foreign refiners who have an approved individual refinery baseline under § 80.94, but one that was not in effect for purposes of anti-dumping compliance during the 1997-1998 annual averaging periods, must comply with the requirements of this section for the gasoline produced at the refinery and imported into the United States during each of the annual averaging periods in which the refinery was subject to its individual anti-dumping baseline. EPA will evaluate all of the information and data submitted under this section in determining the foreign refinery's sulfur baseline pursuant to this paragraph. Where EPA concludes that the data submitted reasonably reflects current sulfur levels, the refinery's baseline will be determined based on the annual average sulfur level and volume of gasoline produced by the foreign refinery and imported into the U.S. during the most recent annual averaging period in which the refinery was subject to its individual anti-dumping baseline.

                (8) A discussion of any sulfur reductions that can be achieved from current levels;
                (9) The date the refiner anticipates compliance with the standards in § 80.195 can be achieved at its refinery;
                (10) An analysis of the economic impact of compliance on the refiner's business (including financial statements from the last 5 years, or for any time period up to 10 years, at EPA's request); and
                (11) Any other information regarding other strategies considered, including strategies or components of strategies that do not involve installation of equipment, and why meeting the standards in § 80.195 beginning in 2008 is infeasible.
                (c) The hardship extension application must contain a letter signed by the president or the chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the application is true to the best of his/her knowledge.
              
              
                § 80.265
                How will the EPA approve or disapprove a hardship extension application?

                (a) EPA will evaluate each application for hardship extension on a case-by-case basis. The factors considered for a hardship extension may include: The refiner's financial position and efforts to obtain capital funding; the refiner's efforts to procure necessary equipment, obtain design and engineering services and construction contractors; the availability of desulfurization equipment; and any other relevant factor. An extension will be granted for a refinery for the 2008 averaging period if the small refiner who owns the refinery adequately demonstrates that severe economic hardship would result if compliance with the standards in § 80.195 is required in 2008, or that compliance with the standard in 2008 is not feasible for reasons beyond the refiner's control, and that the refiner has made the best efforts possible to achieve compliance with the national standards by January 1, 2008. Upon reapplication by the refiner, if EPA determines that further relief is appropriate, EPA may grant a further extension through the 2009 averaging period. In no case will a further extension for the 2009 averaging period be granted unless the refiner demonstrates conclusively that it has financing in place and that it will be able to complete construction and meet the national gasoline sulfur standards no later than December 31, 2009.
                (b) EPA may request more information, if necessary, for evaluation of the application. If requested information is not submitted within the time specified in EPA's request, or any extensions granted, the application may be denied.
                (c) EPA will notify the refiner of approval or disapproval of hardship extension by letter.
                (1) If approved, EPA will also notify the refiner of the date that full compliance with the standards specified at § 80.195 must be achieved or what interim sulfur levels or schedules apply, if any.
                (2) If disapproved, beginning January 1, 2008, the refinery is subject to the requirements in § 80.195. Refiners who receive an extension for the 2008 averaging period shall meet the standards in § 80.195 beginning on January 1, 2009, unless EPA grants an extension of the hardship relief for an additional year. If such an additional extension is granted, the refiner shall meet the standards in § 80.195 on January 1, 2010.
                (d) Refiners who receive a hardship extension may be required to meet more stringent standards than those which apply to them during 2007, and/or could be required to offset excess sulfur levels. EPA may impose reasonable conditions on an extension, such as requiring segregation of the small refiner's gasoline or requiring the gasoline to be sold for use in older vehicles only.
              
              
                § 80.270
                Can a refiner seek temporary relief from the requirements of this subpart?
                (a) EPA may permit a refiner to produce and distribute gasoline which does not meet the requirements of this subpart if the refiner demonstrates that:
                (1) Unusual circumstances exist that impose extreme hardship and significantly affect ability to comply by the applicable date; and
                (2) It has made best efforts to comply with the requirements of this subpart (including making efforts to obtain credits and/or allotments).
                (b) Applications must be submitted to EPA by September 1, 2000. Relief may be granted from some or all of the requirements of this subpart, at EPA's discretion; however, EPA reserves the right to deny applications for appropriate reasons, including unacceptable environmental impact. Approval to distribute gasoline which does not meet the requirements of this subpart may be granted for such time period as EPA determines is appropriate, but shall not extend beyond January 1, 2008.
                (c)(1) Applications must include a plan demonstrating how the refiner will comply with the requirements of this subpart as expeditiously as possible. The plan shall include a showing that contracts are or will be in place for engineering and construction of desulfurization equipment, a plan for applying for and obtaining any permits necessary for construction, a description of plans to obtain necessary capital, and a detailed estimate of when the requirements of this subpart will be met.
                (2) Applications must include a detailed description of the refinery configuration and operations, including, at a minimum, the following information:
                (i) The portion of gasoline production that is produced using an FCC unit;
                (ii) The refinery's hydrotreating capacity;
                (iii) The refinery's total reformer unit throughput capacity;
                (iv) The refinery's total crude capacity;
                (v) Total crude capacity of any other refineries owned by the same entity;
                (vi) Total volume of gasoline production at the refinery;
                (vii) Total volume of other refinery products; and
                (viii) Geographic location(s) in which gasoline will be sold.
                (3) Applications must include, at a minimum, the following information:
                (i) Detailed description of efforts to obtain capital for refinery investments;
                (ii) Bond rating of entity that owns the refinery; and
                (iii) Estimated capital investment needed to comply with the requirements of this subpart by the applicable date.

                (4) Applicants must also provide any other relevant information requested by EPA.
                
                (d) EPA may impose any reasonable conditions on waivers granted under this section.
              
            
            
              Allotment Trading Program
              
                § 80.271
                How can a small refiner obtain an adjustment of its 2004-2007 per-gallon cap standard?
                (a) EPA may in its discretion adjust the small refiner per-gallon cap sulfur standard established for a refinery under § 80.240(a) (the established small refiner per-gallon standard) if the refiner demonstrates that the burden of complying with the established small refiner per-gallon standard would effectively prevent the refiner from participating in the small refiner relief provided in § 80.240. No refiner will be eligible for an adjustment of its established per-gallon standard above 450 ppm. The refinery annual average sulfur standards in § 80.240(a) are not affected by this section.
                (b) A refiner wishing to apply for such an adjustment of its established small refiner per-gallon sulfur standard under § 80.240(a) must send a letter to Gasoline Sulfur Program, U.S. EPA, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, 2000 Traverwood Dr., Ann Arbor, MI 48105 no later than January 1, 2003. Such application must include the following information:
                (1) A detailed description of the nature of the difficulty that the per-gallon cap creates;
                (2) The refiner's proposed adjusted per-gallon cap standard and the proposed duration for the adjustment, including an explanation of how a lower per-gallon cap standard or shorter duration would not address the hardship;
                (3) The refiner's expected actual annual average sulfur level (i.e., prior to the use of any credits or allotments) for each year that the adjustment would be in effect;
                (4) The refiner's estimate of the number of gallons of gasoline it produces that will exceed the established small refiner per-gallon standard under § 80.240(a) for each year that the adjusted per-gallon cap would apply; and
                (5) The number of sulfur credits or allotments that the refiner estimates will be required under paragraph (d) of this section for each year that the adjusted per-gallon cap would apply and a plan for obtaining this number of credits or allotments.
                (6) Other relevant information that EPA requests.
                (c) EPA will evaluate each application for an adjusted per-gallon cap sulfur standard on a case-by-case basis. EPA may impose any reasonable conditions on adjustments granted under this section. EPA may in its discretion set forth the duration of the adjusted per-gallon cap sulfur standard but in no case shall it extend beyond December 31, 2007.
                (d)(1) A small refiner with an adjusted per-gallon sulfur cap standard under paragraph (a) of this section must obtain and use sulfur credits or allotments to offset the amount that the adjusted standard exceeds the established small refiner per-gallon standard under § 80.240(a). The number of sulfur credits or allotments needed for each year that the adjusted per-gallon cap would apply is calculated on a per-batch basis according to paragraph (d)(2) of this section and summed over the averaging period.

                (2) The formula for determining the number of sulfur credits or allotments that such a small refiner is required to use for any batch of gasoline exceeding the established small refiner per-gallon standard under § 80.240(a) is as follows:
                
                CRb = Vb × (Sb−Sc)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  CRb = number of sulfur allotments or sulfur credits needed for the gasoline batch (ppm-gallons)
                  Vb = Volume of the gasoline batch (gallons)
                  Sb = Sulfur level of the gasoline batch (ppm)
                  Sc = Small refiner per-gallon cap standard established for that refinery under § 80.240(a), in ppm.
                
                
                (3) Sulfur credits or allotments used when a small refiner exceeds an established per-gallon cap sulfur standard under § 80.240(a) must be separate from and in addition to credits or allotments used for any other purposes provided under § 80.275 or § 80.315.
                (e) The approving official for an adjustment under this section is the Director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality in the EPA Office of Air and Radiation.

                § 80.275
                How are allotments generated and used?
                (a) Generation of allotments and credits in 2003. (1) During 2003 only, any domestic or foreign refiner who produces gasoline from crude oil may have the option to generate credits in accordance with the provisions of § 80.305 or generate allotments and credits under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
                (2) If the average sulfur content of the gasoline produced at a refinery is less than the refinery's baseline as determined under § 80.295 and is 60 ppm or less, allotments and credits may be generated using the following procedures. This paragraph (a) does not apply to importers.

                (i) If the average sulfur content of the gasoline produced at a refinery is less than or equal to 30, and the refinery's sulfur baseline is greater than 120, the following procedures apply:
                
                SATypeB = (30 − Sa) × V
                SATypeA = V × 90
                CR = (SBase − 120) × V
                

                (ii) If the average sulfur content of the gasoline produced at a refinery is less than or equal to 30, and the refinery's sulfur baseline is greater than 30 but less than or equal to 120, the following procedures apply:
                
                SATypeB = (30 − Sa) × V
                SATypeA = (SBase − 30) × V
                

                (iii) If the average sulfur content of the gasoline produced at a refinery is less than or equal to 30, and the refinery's sulfur baseline is less than or equal to 30, the following procedures apply:
                
                SATypeB = (SBase − Sa) × V
                

                (iv) If the average sulfur content of the gasoline produced at a refinery is greater than 30, and the refinery's sulfur baseline is greater than 120, the following procedures apply:
                
                SATypeA = ((120 − Sa) × V) × 0.8
                CR = (SBase − 120) × V
                

                (v) If the average sulfur content of the gasoline produced at a refinery is greater than 30, and the refinery's sulfur baseline is less than or equal to 120, the following procedures apply:
                
                SATypeA = ((SBase − Sa) × V) × 0.8
                

                (vi) For purposes of the equations under paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (v) of this section, the following definitions apply:
                
                
                  SATypeB = Type B sulfur allotments generated.
                  SATypeA = Type A sulfur allotments generated.
                  CR = Credits generated.
                  SBase = Refinery's sulfur baseline value under § 80.295.
                  Sa = Average sulfur content of the gasoline produced at the refinery during 2003 (or for a foreign refinery, all gasoline produced during 2003 that was imported into the U.S.).
                  V = Volume of gasoline produced at the refinery during 2003 (or for a foreign refinery, all gasoline produced during 2003 that was imported into the U.S.).
                
                
                (b) Generation of allotments in 2004 and 2005. During 2004 and 2005 only, refiners and importers that have corporate pool average sulfur levels below the corporate pool average standards under § 80.195 may generate sulfur allotments separately for each year using the following procedures.

                (1) If the average sulfur content of the gasoline produced or imported is less than 30 the following procedures apply:
                
                SATypeB = (30 − Sa) × Va
                
                SATypeA = (SPS − 30) × Va
                
                

                (2) If the average sulfur content of the gasoline produced or imported is equal to or greater than 30 the following procedures apply:
                
                SATypeA = (SPS − Sa) × Va
                
                

                (3) For purposes of the equations under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the following definitions apply:
                
                
                  SATypeB = Type B sulfur allotments generated.
                  SATypeA = Type A sulfur allotments generated.
                  Sa = Corporate pool average sulfur level for the year.
                  SPS = Corporate pool average standard (120 in 2004; 90 in 2005).
                  Va = Total volume of gasoline produced and/or imported during the year.
                
                
                (4) Oxygenate blenders may not generate allotments under this section.
                (c) Use of sulfur allotments to meet standards. (1) Refiners and importers may use Type A and Type B sulfur allotments to meet the corporate pool average standards under § 80.195, except that if allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 are used to meet the corporate pool standard in 2005 the allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 shall be reduced in value by 50%.
                (2)(i) Small refiners subject to the standards under § 80.240, and refiners and importers of gasoline designated as GPA gasoline under § 80.219(a), may use sulfur allotments to meet their annual average refinery or importer standards.
                (ii) Small refiners subject to the standards under § 80.240 and that have received an adjustment of their per-gallon cap sulfur standards pursuant to § 80.271(a) may also use sulfur allotments to meet the requirements of § 80.271(d)(1) for any refinery that has received such an adjustment.
                (d) Transfers of sulfur allotments. Sulfur allotments generated under this section may be transferred, provided that:
                (1) No allotment may be transferred more than twice: The first transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the allotment may only be made to a refiner or importer who intends to use the allotment; if the transferee cannot use the allotment, it may make the second, and final, transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the allotment. In no case may an allotment be transferred more than twice before being used or terminated.
                (2) The allotment transferor must apply any allotments necessary to meet the transferor's corporate pool average standard before transferring allotments to any other refiner or importer or before converting allotments into credits.
                (3) The transferor must supply to the transferee records indicating the year of generation and type of the allotments, the identity of the refiner or importer who generated the allotments, and the identity of the transferring party, if it is not the same part that generated the allotments.
                (4) The transferor must inform the transferee whether any transferred allotments are Type A allotments or Type B allotments, as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
                (5) In the case of allotments that have been calculated or created improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, the following provisions apply:
                (i) Invalid allotments cannot be used to achieve compliance with the transferee's corporate pool average standard or be converted to credits, regardless of the transferee's good faith belief that the allotments were valid.
                (ii) The refiner or importer who used the allotments, and any transferor of the allotments, must adjust their allotment records and reports and sulfur calculations as necessary to reflect the proper allotments.
                (iii) Any allotments remaining after correcting for the improperly created allotments must first be applied to correct the invalid transfers before the transferor may transfer any other allotments or before converting allotments into credits.
                (e) Conversion of allotments into credits. A refiner or importer may convert allotments into credits using the following procedures:
                (1) Type A allotments may be converted into credits with the same requirements and limitations on use that apply under § 80.315 to credits generated in 2000 through 2003.
                (2) Type B allotments may be converted into credits with the same requirements and limitations on use that apply under § 80.315 to credits generated in 2004 and later, based on the year of creation of the allotment.

                (3) Allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 which are carried over to 2005 are discounted by 50 percent. The discounted allotments may be used to demonstrate compliance with the corporate pool average standard in 2005, or they may be converted into credits for use in demonstrating compliance with the refinery average standard in 2005, or in a subsequent averaging period, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (e). Any allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 that are converted into credits before being carried over to 2005 are not discounted. Any allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 that are converted into credits before being carried over to 2005 may be reconverted into allotments for use in demonstrating compliance with the corporate pool average standard in 2005, but such reconverted allotments are discounted by 50 percent.
                (f) Small refiners. Small refiners subject to the standards under § 80.240 may not generate sulfur allotments under paragraph (b) of this section.
                (g) GPA gasoline. GPA gasoline that is included in the refiner's or importer's corporate pool average under § 80.216(f)(2) must be included in the calculations under paragraph (b) of this section. No refiner or importer may generate allotments in 2004 or 2005 who is not required to meet the corporate pool average standards.
                (h) Allotments and credits under this program are in units of “ppm-gallons”.

                (a) Credit generation in 2000 through 2003. (1) Credits may be generated in 2000 through 2003 under § 80.305 by refiners who produce gasoline from crude oil, and are:
                (i) Refiners who establish a sulfur baseline under § 80.295 for a refinery;
                (ii) Foreign refiners for refineries with an approved baseline under § 80.94, or refineries with baselines established in accordance with § 80.290(d); or
                (iii) Small refiners for any refinery subject to the standards under § 80.240, using their small refiner baseline established under § 80.250 for that refinery.
                (2) Importers and oxygenate blenders may not generate credits under § 80.305.
                (b) Credit generation beginning in 2004. (1) Credits may be generated beginning in 2004 under § 80.310 by:
                (i) Refiners for any refinery, and importers subject to the standards under § 80.195;
                (ii) Refiners and importers of gasoline designated as GPA gasoline under § 80.219, using the least of 150.00 ppm, or the refinery's or importer's 1997-98 baseline calculated under § 80.295 plus 30.00 ppm, or the refinery's lowest annual average sulfur level for any year from 2000 through 2003 during which the refinery generated credits or allotments plus 30.00 ppm (for any party generating credits under both paragraphs (b)(1)(i) of this section and this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), such credits must be calculated separately); or
                (iii) Small refiners for any refinery subject to the standards under § 80.240, using refinery's standard established under § 80.240.
                (2) Generation of credits under § 80.310 for all imported gasoline shall be through the importer.

                How does a refiner apply for a sulfur baseline?
                (a) The refiner must submit an application to EPA which includes the information required under paragraph (c) of this section no later than September 30 of the year in which the refiner plans to begin generating credits, or the refiner or an importer plans to sell gasoline in the geographic phase-in area in accordance with § 80.217.
                (b) The sulfur baseline request must be sent to: U.S. EPA, Attn: Sulfur Program (6406J), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20460. For commercial (non-postal) delivery: U.S. EPA, Attn: Sulfur Program, 501 3rd Street NW., Washington, DC 20001.
                (c) The sulfur baseline application must include the following information:
                (1) A listing of the names and addresses of all refineries owned by the corporation for which the refiner is applying for a sulfur baseline.

                (2) The annual average gasoline sulfur baseline for gasoline produced in 1997-1998, for each refinery for which the refiner is applying for a sulfur baseline, calculated in accordance with § 80.295.
                
                (3) A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer, of the company, or his/her delegate, stating that the information contained in the sulfur baseline determination is true to the best of his/her knowledge.
                (4) Name, address, phone number, facsimile number and E-mail address of a corporate contact person.
                (5) The following information for each batch of gasoline produced in 1997-1998:
                (i) Batch number assigned to the batch under § 80.65(d) or § 80.101(i);
                (ii) Volume; and
                (iii) Sulfur content.
                (6) For any refiner that acquires and/or reactivates a refinery that was shut down or non-operational between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 1998, the average sulfur level of gasoline produced during each annual averaging period that the refinery was in operation after the refinery was acquired and/or reactivated. EPA will evaluate all of the data submitted by the refiner in determining the appropriate sulfur baseline for the refinery. Where EPA concludes that the data submitted reasonably reflects current sulfur levels, the refinery's baseline will be determined based on the average sulfur content of the refinery's gasoline production during the most recent annual averaging period the refinery was in operation.
                (d)(1) Foreign refiners who do not have an approved refinery baseline under § 80.94 must follow the procedures specified in § 80.410(b).
                (2) Foreign refiners who have an approved individual refinery baseline under § 80.94, but one that was not in effect for purposes of anti-dumping compliance during the 1997-1998 annual averaging periods, must comply with the requirements of this section for the gasoline produced at the refinery and imported to the U.S. during each annual averaging period in which the refinery was subject to its individual anti-dumping baseline. EPA will evaluate all of the information and data submitted under this section in determining a foreign refinery's sulfur baseline pursuant to this paragraph (d). Where EPA concludes that the data submitted reasonably reflects current sulfur levels, a foreign refinery's baseline sulfur level under this paragraph will be determined based on the average sulfur level of gasoline produced by the foreign refinery and imported to the U.S. during the most recent annual averaging period in which the refinery was subject to its individual anti-dumping baseline.
                (e) Within 60 days of receipt of an application under this section, EPA will notify the refiner of approval of the refinery's baseline or of any deficiencies in the application.
                (f) If at any time the baseline submitted in accordance with the requirements of this section is determined to be incorrect, EPA will notify the refiner of the corrected baseline.
                (g) Any refiner that seeks temporary relief under § 80.270 shall apply for a refinery sulfur baseline in accordance with the provisions of this section and § 80.295, and if applicable, § 80.410(b), no later than September 1, 2000.

                § 80.295
                How is a refinery sulfur baseline determined?
                (a) A refinery's gasoline sulfur baseline for the purpose of generating credits during years 2000 through 2003 is calculated using the following equation:
                
                  ER10FE00.011
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  SBase = Sulfur baseline value.
                  Vi = Volume of gasoline batch i.
                  Si = Sulfur content of gasoline batch i.

                  n = Total number of batches of gasoline produced during January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1998 (or the total number of batches of gasoline pursuant to § 80.290(c)(6); or, for a foreign refinery, the total number of batches of gasoline produced and imported into the U.S. during January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1998, or, the total number of batches of gasoline produced and imported into the U.S. pursuant to § 80.290(d)(2)).
                  
                  i = Individual batch of gasoline produced during January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1998 (or individual batch of gasoline produced pursuant to § 80.290(c)(6); or, for a foreign refinery, individual batch of gasoline produced and imported into the U.S. during January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1998, or, individual batch of gasoline produced and imported into the U.S. pursuant to § 80.290(d)(2)).
                
                
                (b) Any refiner who, under § 80.69 or § 80.101(d)(4), included oxygenate blended downstream in compliance calculations for 1997-1998 for a refinery must include this oxygenate in the baseline calculations for sulfur content for that refinery under paragraph (a) of this section.
                (c) Sulfur baseline calculations under this section shall be conducted to two decimal places.

                § 80.305
                How are credits generated during the time period 2000 through 2003?
                (a) Credits must be calculated as follows:
                
                CRa = Va × (SBase − Sa)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  CRa = Credits generated for the averaging period.
                  Va = Total volume of gasoline produced during the averaging period at the refinery (or for a foreign refinery, the total volume of gasoline produced during the averaging period at the refinery that was imported into the U.S. in accordance with the requirements of § 80.410)
                  SBase = Sulfur baseline value for the refinery established under § 80.250 or § 80.295.
                  Sa = Actual annual average sulfur level, calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 80.205, for gasoline produced during the averaging period by the refinery, exclusive of any credits, (or for a foreign refinery, the actual average sulfur level, calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 80.205, for gasoline produced during the averaging period at the refinery that was imported into the U.S., in accordance with the requirements of § 80.410, exclusive of any credits.)
                
                
                (b) The refiner may include any oxygenates included in its RFG or conventional gasoline volume under §§ 80.65 and 80.101(d)(4), respectively, for the purpose of generating credits.
                (c) Credits under this program are in units of “ppm-gallons”.
                (d) Refiners may generate credits for gasoline produced during an averaging period for a refinery only if the annual average sulfur level for the gasoline produced at that refinery during the averaging period is less than 0.90 of the refinery's baseline under § 80.250 or § 80.295.
                (e) Credits generated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must be identified by the year of creation.
                (f) For gasoline produced during the year 2000, the averaging period for credits generated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section may be less than the full calendar year. Such partial-year averaging period will begin with the first full month for which all applicable sampling, testing, and documentation requirements are met.

                § 80.310
                How are credits generated beginning in 2004?
                (a) A refiner for any refinery, or an importer, may generate credits in 2004 and thereafter if the annual average sulfur level for gasoline produced or imported for the averaging period is less than 30.00 ppm; or, for refiners that are subject to the small refiner standards in § 80.240, the small refiner annual average sulfur standard applicable to that refinery; or, for refiners and importers subject to the GPA standards in § 80.216, the least of 150.00 ppm, or the refinery's or importer's 1997-1998 sulfur level calculated under § 80.295 plus 30.00 ppm, or the refinery's lowest annual average sulfur level for any year from 2000 through 2003 during which the refinery generated credits or allotments plus 30.00 ppm.
                (b) Credits are calculated as follows:
                
                CRa = Va × (SCredit − Sa)

                § 80.315
                How are credits used and what are the limitations on credit use?
                (a) Credit use. Credits may be used to meet the applicable refinery or importer annual average sulfur standards under § 80.195, § 80.216, or § 80.240, or may be used to meet the offset requirement under § 80.271(d)(1) for any refinery with an adjustment of itsper-gallon cap standard pursuant to § 80.271(a), provided that:
                (1) Sulfur credits used were generated pursuant to the requirements of this subpart; and
                (2) The requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are met.
                (b) Credit transfers. (1) Credits obtained from other persons may be used to meet the annual average standards specified in § 80.195, § 80.216, or § 80.240, or may be used to meet the offset requirement under § 80.271(d)(1) for any refinery with an adjustment of itsper-gallon cap standard pursuant to § 80.271(a), if all the following conditions are met:
                (i) The credits are generated and reported according to the requirements of this subpart.
                (ii) The credits are used in compliance with the limitations regarding the appropriate periods for credit use in this subpart.
                (iii) Any credit transfer takes place no later than March 31 following the calendar year averaging period when the credits are used.
                (iv) No credit may be transferred more than twice: The first transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the credit may only be made to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit; if the transferee cannot use the credit, it may make the second, and final, transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit. In no case may a credit be transferred more than twice before being used or terminated.
                (v) The credit transferor must apply any credits necessary to meet the transferor's applicable average standard before transferring credits to any other refiner or importer.
                (vi) No credits may be transferred that would result in the transferor having a negative credit balance.
                (vii) Each transferor must supply to the transferee records indicating the years the credits were generated, the identity of the refiner or importer who generated the credits, and the identity of the transferring party, if it is not the same party that generated the credits.
                (2) In the case of credits that have been calculated or created improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, the following provisions apply:
                (i) Where a refiner's baseline has been determined to be incorrect under § 80.250(c) or § 80.290(f), any credits generated, banked, used or traded must be adjusted to reflect the corrected baseline.
                (ii) Invalid credits cannot be used to achieve compliance with the transferee's averaging standard, regardless of the transferee's good faith belief that the credits were valid.
                (iii) The refiner or importer who used the credits, and any transferor of the credits, must adjust their credit records and reports and sulfur calculations as necessary to reflect the proper credits.

                (iv) Any properly created credits existing in the transferor's credit balance after correcting the credit balance, and after the transferor applies credits as needed to meet the average standard at the end of the compliance year, must first be applied to correct the invalid transfers before the transferor trades or banks the credits.
                (c) Limitations on credit use. (1) Credits generated prior to 2004 may only be used for demonstrating compliance with the refinery or importer annual average standards under § 80.195 during the 2005 and 2006 averaging periods. Such credits may be used to demonstrate compliance with the standards under § 80.216 during the 2004 through 2006 averaging periods, and with the standards under § 80.240 during the 2004 through 2007 averaging periods, and the 2008 and 2009 averaging periods, if allowed under the terms of a hardship extension under § 80.265.
                (2) Credits generated in 2004 or later may only be used for demonstrating compliance with standards during an averaging period within five years of the year of generation.
                (3) A refiner or importer possessing credits must use all credits prior to falling into compliance deficit under § 80.205(e).
                (4) Credits may not be used to meet corporate pool average standards under § 80.195.

                § 80.330
                What are the sampling and testing requirements for refiners and importers?
                (a) Sample and test each batch of gasoline. (1) Refiners and importers shall collect a representative sample from each batch of gasoline produced or imported and test each sample to determine its sulfur content for compliance with requirements under this subpart prior to the gasoline leaving the refinery or import facility, using the sampling and testing methods provided in this section.
                (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the requirements of this section apply beginning January 1, 2004, or January 1 of the first year of allotment or credit generation under § 80.275 or § 80.305, whichever is earlier.
                (3) Prior to January 1, 2004:
                (i) Any refiner may release gasoline from the refinery prior to obtaining the test results required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
                (ii) Any refiner of conventional gasoline may combine samples of gasoline from more than one batch of gasoline or blendstock prior to analysis and treat such composite sample as one batch of gasoline or blendstock pursuant to the requirements of § 80.101(i)(2).
                (4)(i) Beginning January 1, 2004, any refiner who produces gasoline using computer-controlled in-line blending equipment is exempt from the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section to obtain the test results required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section prior to the gasoline leaving the refinery, provided that the refiner obtains an exemption from this requirement from EPA. To obtain such exemption, the refiner must:
                (A) Have been granted an in-line blending exemption under § 80.65(f)(4); or
                (B) If the refiner has not been granted an exemption under § 80.65(f)(4), submit to EPA all of the information required under § 80.65(f)(4)(i)(A). A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B).
                (ii) Refiners who seek an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section must comply with any request by EPA for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption.

                (iii) Within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a submission under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section, EPA will notify the refiner if the exemption is not approved or of any deficiencies in the refiner's submission, or if any additional information is required or other requirements are included in the exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. In the absence of such notification from EPA, the effective date of an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for refiners who do not hold an exemption under § 80.65(f)(4) is 60 days from EPA's receipt of the refiner's submission under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
                (iv) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the refiner's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the sulfur content of the refinery's gasoline production, or if EPA determines that any other circumstances exist which merit modification of the requirements of an exemption, such as advancements in the state of the art for in-line blending measurement which allow for additional control or more accurate monitoring or documentation of sulfur content. If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the refiner's exemption will be void ab initio.
                (b) Sampling methods. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, refiners and importers shall sample each batch of gasoline by using one of the following methods:
                (1) Manual sampling of tanks and pipelines shall be performed according to the applicable procedures specified in one of the two following methods:
                (i) ASTM D4057.
                (ii) Samples collected under the applicable procedures in ASTM D5842 may be used for measuring sulfur content if there is no contamination present that could affect the sulfur test result.
                (2) Automatic sampling of petroleum products in pipelines shall be performed according to the applicable procedures specified in ASTM D4177.
                (c) Test method for measuring sulfur content of gasoline. (1) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, refiners and importers shall use the method provided in § 80.46(a)(1) or one of the alternative test methods listed in § 80.46(a)(3) to measure the sulfur content of gasoline they produce or import through December 31, 2015. Beginning January 1, 2016, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, refiners and importers shall use an approved method in § 80.47.
                (2) Except as provided in § 80.350 and in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, any ASTM sulfur test method for liquefied fuels may be used for quality assurance testing under § 80.400, or to determine whether gasoline qualifies for a S-RGAS downstream standard, if the protocols of the ASTM method are followed and the alternative method is correlated to the method provided in § 80.46(a)(1).
                (d) Test method for sulfur in butane. (1) Refiners and importers shall use the method provided in § 80.46(a)(2) through December 31, 2015 to measure the sulfur content of butane when the butane constitutes a batch of gasoline. Beginning January 1, 2016, refiners and importers shall use an approved method in § 80.47 to measure the sulfur content of butane when the butane constitutes a batch of gasoline.
                (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, any ASTM sulfur test method for gaseous fuels may be used for quality assurance testing under §§ 80.340(b)(4) and 80.400, if the protocols of the ASTM method are followed and the alternative test method is correlated to the method provided in § 80.46(a)(2) through December 31, 2015, or in § 80.47 beginning January 1, 2016.

                (i) Provide a retained sample portion to the Administrator's authorized representative; and
                (ii) Ship a retained sample portion to EPA, within 2 working days of the date of the request, by an overnight shipping service or comparable means, to the address and following procedures specified by EPA, and accompanied with the sulfur test result for the sample determined under § 80.330(a).
                (b) Sample retention requirement for samples subject to independent analysis requirements. (1) Any refiner or importer who meets the independent analysis requirements under § 80.65(f) for any batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB will have met the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, provided the independent laboratory meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the gasoline batch.
                (2) For samples retained by an independent laboratory under paragraph (b) of this section, the test results required to be submitted under paragraph (a) of this section shall be the test results determined under § 80.65(e).
                (c) Sampling compliance certification. Any refiner or importer shall include with each annual report filed under § 80.370, the following statement, which must accurately reflect the facts and must be signed and dated by the same person who signs the annual report:
                
                
                  I certify that I have made inquiries that are sufficient to give me knowledge of the procedures to collect and store gasoline samples, and I further certify that the procedures meet the requirements of the ASTM procedures required under 40 CFR 80.330.
                
                
                (d) Prior to January 1, 2004, for purposes of complying with the requirements of this section, refiners who analyze composited samples under § 80.330(a)(3) must retain portions of the composited samples. Portions of samples of each batch comprising the composited samples are not required to be retained.
                (e) For purposes of complying with the requirements of this section for RBOB, a sample of each RBOB batch produced plus a sample of the ethanol used to conduct the handblend testing pursuant to § 80.69 must be retained.

                § 80.340
                What standards and requirements apply to refiners producing gasoline by blending blendstocks into previously certified gasoline (PCG)?
                (a) Any refiner who produces gasoline by blending blendstock into PCG must meet the requirements of § 80.330 to sample and test every batch of gasoline as follows:
                (1)(i) Sample and test to determine the volume and sulfur content of the PCG prior to blendstock blending.
                (ii) Sample and test to determine the volume and sulfur content of the gasoline subsequent to blendstock blending.
                (iii) Calculate the volume and sulfur content of the blendstock, by subtracting the volume and sulfur content of the PCG from the volume and sulfur content of the gasoline subsequent to blendstock blending. The blendstock is a batch for purposes of compliance calculations and reporting. For purposes of this paragraph (a), compliance with the applicable cap standard under § 80.195(a) shall be determined based on the sulfur content of the gasoline subsequent to blendstock blending.
                (2) In the alternative, a refiner may sample and test each batch of blendstock when received at the refinery to determine the volume and sulfur content, and treat each blendstock receipt as a separate batch for purposes of compliance calculations for the annual average sulfur standard and for reporting. This alternative applies only if every batch of blendstock used at a refinery during an averaging period has a sulfur content that is equal to, or less than, the applicable per-gallon cap standard under §§ 80.195 or 80.216.
                (b) Refiners who blend only butane into PCG may meet the sampling and testing requirements by using sulfur test results of the butane supplier, provided that the following requirements are also met:
                (1) The sulfur content of the butane received from the butane supplier must not exceed the following sulfur standards on a per-gallon basis as follows:
                (i)(A) 120 ppm in 2004;
                (B) 30 ppm from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2016; and
                (C) 10 ppm on or after January 1, 2017.
                (ii) Except that the per-gallon sulfur content of butane blended to PCG that is designated as GPA gasoline shall not exceed 150 ppm from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2006.
                (2) The refiner obtains test results from the butane supplier that demonstrate that the sulfur content of each load of butane supplied does not exceed the applicable per-gallon sulfur standard under paragraph (b)(1) of this section through test results of samples of the butane contained in the storage tank from which the butane blender is supplied.
                (i) Testing for the sulfur content of the butane by the supplier must be subsequent to each receipt of butane into the supplier's storage tank, or the testing must be immediately before transfer of butane to the butane blender.
                (ii) The testing must be performed by the method specified in § 80.46(a)(2) or by the alternative method specified in § 80.46(a)(4).
                (iii) The butane blender must obtain a copy of the butane supplier's test results, at the time of each transfer of butane to the butane blender, that reflect the sulfur content of each load of butane supplied to the butane blender.
                (3) The sulfur content and volume of each batch of gasoline produced is that of the butane the refiner blends into gasoline for purposes of calculating compliance with the standards in §§ 80.195 and 80.216.
                (4) The refiner must conduct a quality assurance program of sampling and testing for each butane supplier that demonstrates the butane sulfur content does not exceed the applicable per-gallon sulfur standard in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The frequency of butane sampling and testing, for each butane supplier, must be one sample for every 500,000 gallons of butane received, or one sample every 3 months, whichever results in more frequent sampling.
                (5) If any of the requirements of this section are not met, in whole or in part, for any butane blended into gasoline, that butane is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur standards in § 80.195 or § 80.216, as applicable.

                (c) The procedures in §§ 80.65(i) and 80.101(g)(9) may be applied for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the sulfur standards under this subpart.
                
                (d) Refiners who blend only blender-grade pentane into PCG pursuant to the requirements of § 80.85 may meet the sampling and testing requirements by using sulfur test results of the pentane supplier pursuant to the requirements § 80.85, provided that the following requirements are also met:
                (1) The sulfur content and volume of each batch of gasoline produced is that of the blender-grade pentane the refiner blends into gasoline for purposes of calculating compliance with the standards in §§ 80.195 and 80.216.
                (2) If any of the requirements of this section are not met, in whole or in part, for any pentane blended into gasoline, that pentane is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur standards in § 80.85, or § 80.86, § 80.195, § 80.216 as applicable.

                § 80.350
                What alternative sulfur standards and requirements apply to importers who transport gasoline by truck?
                Importers who import gasoline into the United States by truck may comply with the following requirements instead of the requirements to sample and test every batch of gasoline under § 80.330, and the annual sulfur average and per-gallon cap standards otherwise applicable to importers under §§ 80.195 and 80.216:
                (a) Alternative standards. The imported gasoline must comply with the standards in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section as follows:
                (1) The applicable average standards, corporate average standards and per-gallon standards under § 80.195(a)(1), except that imported gasoline designated for use in the geographic phase-in area from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2006 must comply with an average standard of 150 ppm and a per-gallon standard of 300 ppm; or
                (2) In 2004, a per-gallon standard of 120 ppm, and in 2005 and subsequent years a per-gallon standard of 30 ppm, except that imported gasoline designated for use in the geographic phase-in area from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2006 must comply with a per-gallon standard of 150 ppm.
                (b) Terminal testing. The importer may use test results for sulfur content testing conducted by the terminal operator, for gasoline contained in the storage tank from which trucks used to transport gasoline into the United States are loaded, for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the standards in paragraph (a) of this section, provided the following conditions are met:
                (1) The sampling and testing shall be performed after each receipt of gasoline into the storage tank, or immediately before each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck.
                (2) The sampling and testing shall be performed using the methods specified in § 80.330(b) and § 80.46(a)(1) or one of the alternative test methods listed in § 80.46(a)(3), respectively.
                (3) At the time of each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck for import to the U.S., the importer must obtain a copy of the terminal test result that indicates the sulfur content of the truck load.
                (c) Quality assurance program. The importer must conduct a quality assurance program, as specified in this paragraph, for each truck loading terminal.
                (1) Quality assurance samples must be obtained from the truck-loading terminal and tested by the importer, or by an independent laboratory, and the terminal operator must not know in advance when samples are to be collected.
                (2) The sampling and testing must be performed using the methods specified in §§ 80.330(b) and 80.46(a)(1), respectively.

                (3) The quality assurance test results for sulfur must differ from the terminal test result by no more than the ASTM reproducibility of the terminal's test results, as determined by the following equation:
                
                
                  R = 105 × ((S + 2)/104)0.4
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  R = ASTM reproducibility.
                  S = Sulfur content based on the terminal's test result.
                
                

                (4) The frequency of the quality assurance sampling and testing must be at least one sample for each fifty of an importer's trucks that are loaded at a terminal, or one sample per month, whichever is more frequent.
                (d) Party required to conduct quality assurance testing. The quality assurance program under paragraph (c) of this section shall be conducted by the importer. In the alternative, this testing may be conducted by an independent laboratory that meets the criteria under § 80.65(f)(2)(iii), provided the importer receives, no later than 21 days after the sample was taken, copies of all results of tests conducted.
                (e) Assignment of batch numbers. The importer must treat each truck load of imported gasoline as a separate batch for purposes of assigning batch numbers and maintaining records under § 80.365, and reporting under § 80.370.
                (f) EPA inspections of terminals. EPA inspectors or auditors, and auditors conducting attest engagements under § 80.415, must be given full and immediate access to the truck-loading terminal and any laboratory at which samples of gasoline collected at the terminal are analyzed, and must be allowed to conduct inspections, review records, collect gasoline samples, and perform audits. These inspections or audits may be either announced or unannounced.
                (g) Certified Sulfur-FRGAS. This section does not apply to Certified Sulfur-FRGAS.
                (h) Reporting requirements. Any importer who elects to comply with the alternative standards in paragraph (a) of this section shall comply with the following requirements:
                (1) All importer recordkeeping and reporting requirements under §§ 80.365 and 80.370, except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
                (2) An importer who elects to comply with the alternative standards in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must certify in the annual report whether it is in compliance with the applicable per-gallon batch standard set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in lieu of providing the information required by § 80.370(a) regarding annual average sulfur content and compliance with the average standard under § 80.195.
                (i) Effect of noncompliance. If any of the requirements of this section are not met, all gasoline imported by the truck importer during the time any requirements are not met is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur average and per-gallon cap standards in § 80.195 or § 80.216, as applicable. Additionally, if any requirement is not met, EPA may notify the importer of the violation and, if the requirement is not fulfilled within 10 days of notification, the truck importer may not in the future use the sampling and testing provisions in this section in lieu of the provisions in § 80.330.

                § 80.374
                What if a refiner or importer is unable to produce gasoline conforming to the requirements of this subpart?
                In appropriate extreme and unusual circumstances (e.g., natural disaster or Act of God) which are clearly outside the control of the refiner or importer and which could not have been avoided by the exercise of prudence, diligence, and due care, EPA may permit a refiner or importer, for a brief period, to distribute gasoline which does not meet the requirements of this subpart provided the refiner or importer meets all the criteria, requirements and conditions contained in § 80.73 (a) through (e).
              
              
                § 80.375
                What requirements apply to California gasoline?
                (a) Definition. For purposes of this subpart California gasoline means any gasoline designated by the refiner as for use in California.
                (b) California gasoline exemption. California gasoline that complies with all the requirements of this section is exempt from all other provisions of this subpart.
                (c) Requirements for California gasoline. The requirements are:
                (1) Each batch of California gasoline must be designated as such by its refiner or importer;
                (2) Designated California gasoline must be kept segregated from gasoline that is not California gasoline, at all points in the distribution system;
                (3) Designated California gasoline must ultimately be used in the State of California and not used elsewhere;
                (4) In the case of California gasoline produced outside the State of California, the transferors and transferees must meet the product transfer document requirements under § 80.81(g); and
                (5) Gasoline that is ultimately used in any part of the United States outside of the State of California must comply with the standards and requirements of this subpart, regardless of any designation as California gasoline.
                (d) Use of California test methods and off site sampling procedures. In the case of any gasoline that is not California gasoline and that is either produced at a refinery located in the State of California or is imported from outside the United States into the State of California, the refiner or importer may, with regard to such gasoline:
                (1) Use the sampling and testing methods approved in Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations instead of the sampling and testing methods required under § 80.330; and
                (2) Determine the sulfur content of gasoline at off site tankage as permitted in § 80.81(h)(2).

                (c) Additional requirements. (1) The product transfer documents associated with R&D gasoline must identify the gasoline as such, and must state that the gasoline is to be used only for research, development, or testing purposes.
                (2) The R&D gasoline must be designated by the refiner or importer as exempt R&D gasoline.
                (3) The R&D gasoline must be kept segregated from non-exempt gasoline at all points in the distribution system of the gasoline.
                (4) The R&D gasoline must not be sold, distributed, offered for sale or distribution, dispensed, supplied, offered for supply, transported to or from, or stored by a gasoline retail outlet, or by a wholesale purchaser-consumer facility, unless the wholesale purchaser-consumer facility is associated with the R&D program that uses the gasoline.
                (d) Memorandum of exemption. The Administrator will grant an R&D exemption upon a demonstration that the requirements of this section have been met. The R&D exemption will be granted in the form of a memorandum of exemption signed by the applicant and the Administrator (or delegate), which may include such terms and conditions as the Administrator determines necessary to monitor the exemption and to carry out the purposes of this section, including restoration of motor vehicle emissions control systems. Any violation of such a term or condition of the exemption or any requirement under this section will cause the exemption to be void ab initio.
                (e) Effects of exemption. Gasoline that is subject to an R&D exemption under this section is exempt from other provisions of this subpart provided that the gasoline is used in a manner that complies with the memorandum of exemption granted under paragraph (d) of this section.

                (a) Any person deemed liable for a violation of a prohibition under § 80.395 (a)(3) through (8), will not be deemed in violation if the person demonstrates that:
                
                (1) The violation was not caused by the person or the person's employee or agent; and
                (2) The person conducted a quality assurance sampling and testing program, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. A carrier may rely on the quality assurance program carried out by another party, including the party who owns the gasoline in question, provided that the quality assurance program is carried out properly. Retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers are not required to conduct quality assurance programs.
                (b) In the case of a violation found at a facility operating under the corporate, trade or brand name of a refiner or importer, or a refiner's or importer's marketing subsidiary, the refiner or importer must show, in addition to the defense elements required under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, that the violation was caused by:
                (1) An act in violation of law (other than the Clean Air Act or this part 80), or an act of sabotage or vandalism;
                (2) The action of any refiner, importer, retailer, distributor, reseller, oxygenate blender, carrier, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer in violation of a contractual agreement between the branded refiner or importer and the person designed to prevent such action, and despite periodic sampling and testing by the branded refiner or importer to ensure compliance with such contractual obligation; or
                (3) The action of any carrier or other distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner or importer, but engaged for transportation of gasoline, despite specifications or inspections of procedures and equipment which are reasonably calculated to prevent such action.
                (c) Under paragraph (a) of this section for any person to show that a violation was not caused by that person, or under paragraph (b) of this section to show that a violation was caused by any of the specified actions, the person must demonstrate by reasonably specific showing, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another person and that the person asserting the defense did not contribute to that other person's causation.
                (d) Quality assurance and testing program. To demonstrate an acceptable quality assurance and testing program under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a person must present evidence of the following:
                (1) A periodic sampling and testing program to ensure the gasoline the person sold, dispensed, supplied, stored, or transported, meets the applicable sulfur standard; and
                (2) On each occasion when gasoline is found not in compliance with the applicable sulfur standard:
                (i) The person immediately ceases selling, offering for sale, dispensing, supplying, offering for supply, storing or transporting the non-complying product; and
                (ii) The person promptly remedies the violation and the factors that caused the violation (for example, by removing the non-complying product from the distribution system until the applicable standard is achieved and taking steps to prevent future violations of a similar nature from occurring).
                (3) For any carrier who transports gasoline in a tank truck, the quality assurance program required under this paragraph (d) need not include periodic sampling and testing of gasoline in the tank truck, but in lieu of such tank truck sampling and testing, the carrier shall demonstrate evidence of an oversight program for monitoring compliance with the requirements of this subpart relating to the transport or storage of gasoline by tank truck, such as appropriate guidance to drivers regarding compliance with the applicable sulfur standard and product transfer document requirements, and the periodic review of records received in the ordinary course of business concerning gasoline quality and delivery.
              
              
                § 80.405
                What penalties apply under this subpart?

                (a) Any person liable for a violation under § 80.395 is subject to civil penalties as specified in section 205 of the Clean Air Act for every day of each such violation and the amount of economic benefit or savings resulting from each violation.

              Provisions for Foreign Refiners With Individual Sulfur Baselines
              
                § 80.410
                What are the additional requirements for gasoline produced at foreign refineries having individual small refiner sulfur baselines, foreign refineries granted temporary relief under § 80.270, or baselines for generating credits during 2000 through 2003?
                (a) Definitions. (1) A foreign refinery is a refinery that is located outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively referred to in this section as “the United States”).
                (2) A foreign refiner is a person who meets the definition of refiner under § 80.2(i) for a foreign refinery.
                (3) A small foreign refiner is a refiner that meets the definition of a small refiner under § 80.225.
                (4) “Sulfur-FRGAS” means gasoline produced at a foreign refinery that has been assigned an individual refinery sulfur baseline under §§ 80.250 or 80.295, or has been granted temporary relief under § 80.270, and that is imported into the United States.
                (5) “Non-Sulfur-FRGAS” means gasoline that is produced at a foreign refinery that has not been assigned an individual refinery sulfur baseline, gasoline produced at a foreign refinery with an individual refinery sulfur baseline that is not imported into the United States, and gasoline produced at a foreign refinery with an individual sulfur baseline during a year when the foreign refiner has opted to not participate in the Sulfur-FRGAS program under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

                (6) “Certified Sulfur-FRGAS” means Sulfur-FRGAS the foreign refiner intends to include in the foreign refinery's sulfur compliance calculations under § 80.205 pursuant to § 80.240 or § 80.270 or credit calculations under §§ 80.305 or 80.310 and allotment calculations under § 80.275(a), and does include in these compliance calculations when reported to EPA.
                (7) “Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS” means Sulfur-FRGAS that is not Certified Sulfur-FRGAS.
                (b) Baseline establishment. Any foreign refiner who does not have an approved refinery baseline under § 80.94 may submit a petition to the Administrator for an individual refinery sulfur baseline pursuant to §§ 80.245 and 80.250, a baseline for generating credits or allotments under §§ 80.290 and 80.295, or a baseline for temporary refinery relief under §§ 80.270 and 80.295.
                (1) The refiner shall follow the procedures specified in §§ 80.91 through 80.93 to establish the volume and sulfur content of gasoline that was produced at the foreign refinery and imported into the United States during 1997 and 1998 for purposes of establishing baselines under § 80.250 or § 80.295.
                (2) In making determinations for foreign refinery baselines EPA will consider all information supplied by a foreign refiner, and in addition may rely on any and all appropriate assumptions necessary to make such determinations.
                (3) Where a foreign refiner submits a petition that is incomplete or inadequate to establish an accurate baseline, and the refiner fails to cure this defect after a request for more information, EPA will not assign an individual refinery sulfur baseline.
                (c) General requirements for foreign refiners with individual refinery sulfur baselines. A foreign refiner of a refinery that has been assigned an individual sulfur baseline under § 80.250 or § 80.295 must designate all gasoline produced at the foreign refinery that is exported to the United States as either Certified Sulfur-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
                (1) In the case of Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, the foreign refiner must meet all provisions that apply to refiners under this subpart H.
                (2) In the case of Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, the foreign refiner shall meet all the following provisions, except the foreign refiner shall substitute the name Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS for the names “reformulated gasoline” or “RBOB” wherever they appear in the following provisions:
                (i) The designation requirements in this section;
                (ii) The recordkeeping requirements under § 80.365;
                (iii) The reporting requirements in § 80.370 and this section;
                (iv) The product transfer document requirements in this section;
                (v) The prohibitions in this section and § 80.385; and
                (vi) The independent audit requirements under § 80.415, paragraph (h) of this section, §§ 80.125 through 80.127, § 80.128(a),(b),(c),(g) through (i), and § 80.130.
                (3)(i) Any foreign refiner that generates sulfur credits under § 80.305 during the period 2000 through 2003, or allotments under § 80.275(a) during 2003, and any small refiner generating credits under § 80.310, shall designate all Sulfur-FRGAS as Certified Sulfur-FRGAS for any year that such credits are generated.
                (ii) Any foreign refiner that has been assigned an individual sulfur baseline for a foreign refinery under § 80.250 or § 80.295 may elect to classify no gasoline imported into the United States as Sulfur-FRGAS, provided the foreign refiner notifies EPA of the election no later than November 1 of the prior calendar year.
                (iii) An election under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section shall:
                (A) Apply to an entire calendar year averaging period, and apply to all gasoline produced during the calendar year at the foreign refinery that is used in the United States; and
                (B) Remain in effect for each succeeding calendar year averaging period, unless and until the foreign refiner notifies EPA of a termination of the election. The change in election shall take effect at the beginning of the next calendar year.
                (d) Designation, product transfer documents, and foreign refiner certification. (1) Any foreign refiner of a foreign refinery that has been assigned an individual sulfur baseline must designate each batch of Sulfur-FRGAS as such at the time the gasoline is produced, unless the refinery has elected to classify no gasoline exported to the United States as Sulfur-FRGAS under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
                (2) On each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any Sulfur-FRGAS prior to its being imported into the United States, it must include the following information as part of the product transfer document information in this section:
                (i) Identification of the gasoline as Certified Sulfur-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS; and
                (ii) The name and EPA refinery registration number of the refinery where the Sulfur-FRGAS was produced.
                (3) On each occasion when Sulfur-FRGAS is loaded onto a vessel or other transportation mode for transport to the United States, the foreign refiner shall prepare a certification for each batch of the Sulfur-FRGAS that meets the following requirements:
                (i) The certification shall include the report of the independent third party under paragraph (f) of this section, and the following additional information:
                (A) The name and EPA registration number of the refinery that produced the Sulfur-FRGAS;
                (B) The identification of the gasoline as Certified Sulfur-FRGAS or Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS;
                (C) The volume of Sulfur-FRGAS being transported, in gallons;
                (D) In the case of Certified Sulfur-FRGAS:
                (1) The sulfur content as determined under paragraph (f) of this section; and
                (2) A declaration that the Sulfur-FRGAS is being included in the compliance calculations under § 80.205 or credit calculations under § 80.305 or allotments under § 80.275(a) for the refinery that produced the Sulfur-FRGAS.

                (ii) The certification shall be made part of the product transfer documents for the Sulfur-FRGAS. Prior to 2004, the information required under paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D)(1) of this section may be omitted from the product transfer documents that accompany the gasoline, provided that such information is provided to the United States importer prior to collection of the representative sample required under paragraph (o)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
                (e) Transfers of Sulfur-FRGAS to non-United States markets. The foreign refiner is responsible to ensure that all gasoline classified as Sulfur-FRGAS is imported into the United States. A foreign refiner may remove the Sulfur-FRGAS classification, and the gasoline need not be imported into the United States, but only if:
                (1)(i) The foreign refiner excludes:
                (A) The volume of gasoline from the refinery's compliance calculations under § 80.205; and
                (B) In the case of Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, the volume and sulfur content of the gasoline from the compliance calculations under § 80.205 or credit calculations under § 80.305.
                (ii) The exclusions under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall be on the basis of the sulfur content and volumes determined under paragraph (f) of this section; and
                (2) The foreign refiner obtains sufficient evidence in the form of documentation that the gasoline was not imported into the United States.
                (f) Load port independent sampling, testing and refinery identification. (1) On each occasion Sulfur-FRGAS is loaded onto a vessel for transport to the United States a foreign refiner shall have an independent third party:
                (i) Inspect the vessel prior to loading and determine the volume of any tank bottoms;
                (ii) Determine the volume of Sulfur-FRGAS loaded onto the vessel (exclusive of any tank bottoms present before vessel loading);
                (iii) Obtain the EPA-assigned registration number of the foreign refinery;
                (iv) Determine the name and country of registration of the vessel used to transport the Sulfur-FRGAS to the United States; and
                (v) Determine the date and time the vessel departs the port serving the foreign refinery.
                (2) On each occasion Certified Sulfur-FRGAS is loaded onto a vessel for transport to the United States a foreign refiner shall have an independent third party:

                (i) Collect a representative sample of the Certified Sulfur-FRGAS from each vessel compartment subsequent to loading on the vessel and prior to departure of the vessel from the port serving the foreign refinery;
                
                (ii) Prepare a volume-weighted vessel composite sample from the compartment samples, and determine the value for sulfur in accordance with the methodology and requirements specified in § 80.330, by:
                (A) The third party analyzing the sample; or
                (B) The third party observing the foreign refiner analyze the sample;
                (iii) Review original documents that reflect movement and storage of the certified Sulfur-FRGAS from the refinery to the load port, and from this review determine:
                (A) The refinery at which the Sulfur-FRGAS was produced; and
                (B) That the Sulfur-FRGAS remained segregated from:
                (1) Non-Sulfur-FRGAS and Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS; and
                (2) Other Certified Sulfur-FRGAS produced at a different refinery.
                (3) The independent third party shall submit a report:
                (i) To the foreign refiner containing the information required under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, to accompany the product transfer documents for the vessel; and
                (ii) To the Administrator containing the information required under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, within thirty days following the date of the independent third party's inspection. This report shall include a description of the method used to determine the identity of the refinery at which the gasoline was produced, assurance that the gasoline remained segregated as specified in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, and a description of the gasoline's movement and storage between production at the source refinery and vessel loading.
                (4) The independent third party must:
                (i) Be approved in advance by EPA, based on a demonstration of ability to perform the procedures required in this paragraph (f);
                (ii) Be independent under the criteria specified in § 80.65(f)(2)(iii); and
                (iii) Sign a commitment that contains the provisions specified in paragraph (i) of this section with regard to activities, facilities and documents relevant to compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (f).
                (g) Comparison of load port and port of entry testing. (1)(i) Except as described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, any foreign refiner and any United States importer of Certified Sulfur-FRGAS shall compare the results from the load port testing under paragraph (f) of this section, with the port of entry testing as reported under paragraph (o) of this section, for the volume of gasoline and the sulfur value.
                (ii) Where a vessel transporting Certified Sulfur-FRGAS off loads this gasoline at more than one United States port of entry, and the conditions of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section are met at the first United States port of entry, the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section do not apply at subsequent ports of entry if the United States importer obtains a certification from the vessel owner, that meets the requirements of paragraph (s) of this section, that the vessel has not loaded any gasoline or blendstock between the first United States port of entry and the subsequent port of entry.
                (2)(i) The requirements of this paragraph (g)(2) apply if:
                (A) The temperature-corrected volumes determined at the port of entry and at the load port differ by more than one percent; or
                (B) The sulfur value determined at the port of entry is higher than the sulfur value determined at the load port, and the amount of this difference is greater than the reproducibility amount specified for the port of entry test result by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM).
                (ii) The United States importer and the foreign refiner shall treat the gasoline as Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, and the foreign refiner shall exclude the gasoline volume and properties from its gasoline sulfur compliance calculations under § 80.205.
                (h) Attest requirements. The following additional procedures shall be carried out by any foreign refiner of Sulfur-FRGAS as part of the applicable attest engagement for each foreign refinery under § 80.415:

                (1) The inventory reconciliation analysis under § 80.128(b) and the tender analysis under § 80.128(c) shall include Non-Sulfur-FRGAS in addition to the gasoline types listed in § 80.128(b) and (c).
                (2) Obtain separate listings of all tenders of Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, and of Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS. Agree the total volume of tenders from the listings to the gasoline inventory reconciliation analysis in § 80.128(b), and to the volumes determined by the third party under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
                (3) For each tender under paragraph (h)(2) of this section where the gasoline is loaded onto a marine vessel, report as a finding the name and country of registration of each vessel, and the volumes of Sulfur-FRGAS loaded onto each vessel.
                (4) Select a sample from the list of vessels identified in paragraph (h)(3) of this section used to transport Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, in accordance with the guidelines in § 80.127, and for each vessel selected perform the following:
                (i) Obtain the report of the independent third party, under paragraph (f) of this section, and of the United States importer under paragraph (o) of this section.
                (A) Agree the information in these reports with regard to vessel identification, gasoline volumes and test results.
                (B) Identify, and report as a finding, each occasion the load port and port of entry parameter and volume results differ by more than the amounts allowed in paragraph (g) of this section, and determine whether the foreign refiner adjusted its refinery calculations as required in paragraph (g) of this section.
                (ii) Obtain the documents used by the independent third party to determine transportation and storage of the Certified Sulfur-FRGAS from the refinery to the load port, under paragraph (f) of this section. Obtain tank activity records for any storage tank where the Certified Sulfur-FRGAS is stored, and pipeline activity records for any pipeline used to transport the Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, prior to being loaded onto the vessel. Use these records to determine whether the Certified Sulfur-FRGAS was produced at the refinery that is the subject of the attest engagement, and whether the Certified Sulfur-FRGAS was mixed with any Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, Non-Sulfur-FRGAS, or any Certified Sulfur-FRGAS produced at a different refinery.
                (5)(i) Select a sample from the list of vessels identified in paragraph (h)(3) of this section used to transport certified and Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS, in accordance with the guidelines in § 80.127, and for each vessel selected perform the following:
                (ii) Obtain a commercial document of general circulation that lists vessel arrivals and departures, and that includes the port and date of departure of the vessel, and the port of entry and date of arrival of the vessel.

                (B) All Non-Certified Sulfur-FRGAS; or
                (C) All Non-Sulfur-FRGAS;
                (iii) Procedures for obtaining and reviewing truck loading records and United States import documents for Certified Sulfur-FRGAS to ensure that such gasoline is only loaded into trucks making deliveries to the United States; and
                (iv) Attest procedures to be conducted annually by an independent third party that review loading records and import documents based on volume reconciliation, or other criteria, to confirm that all Certified Sulfur-FRGAS remains segregated throughout the distribution system and is only loaded into trucks for import into the United States.
                (3) The petition required by this section must be submitted to EPA along with the application for small refiner status and individual refinery sulfur baseline and standards under § 80.240 and this section.
                (q) Withdrawal or suspension of a foreign refinery's baseline. EPA may withdraw or suspend a baseline that has been assigned to a foreign refinery where:
                (1) A foreign refiner fails to meet any requirement of this section;
                (2) A foreign government fails to allow EPA inspections as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section;
                (3) A foreign refiner asserts a claim of, or a right to claim, sovereign immunity in an action to enforce the requirements in this subpart H; or
                (4) A foreign refiner fails to pay a civil or criminal penalty that is not satisfied using the foreign refiner bond specified in paragraph (k) of this section.
                (r) Early use of a foreign refinery baseline. (1) A foreign refiner may begin using an individual refinery baseline before EPA has approved the baseline, provided that:
                (i) A baseline petition has been submitted as required in paragraph (b) of this section;
                (ii) EPA has made a provisional finding that the baseline petition is complete;

                (g) Credits required for GPA gasoline. The following attest procedures shall be completed in 2004 through 2006 for a refinery or importer that produces gasoline subject to the geographic phase-in area standards under § 80.216:
                (1) Obtain the annual average sulfur level for the refinery's or importer's GPA gasoline from paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
                (2) If the value in paragraph (g)(1) of this section is greater than the refinery's or importer's baseline plus 30 ppm under § 80.216, as determined in paragraph (a) of this section or 150 ppm, whichever is less, compute and report as a finding the difference between the annual average sulfur level and the baseline level plus 30 ppm, or 150 ppm, whichever is less.
                (3) Compute and report as a finding the total sulfur credits and/or allotments required by multiplying the value in paragraph (g)(2) of this section times the volume of GPA gasoline from paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
                (4) Obtain the refiner's or importer's representation as to the portion of the deficit under paragraph (g)(3) of this section that was resolved with credits, or the portion that was resolved with allotments in 2004 or 2005 only (compliance deficits for GPA gasoline cannot be carried forward).
                (h) Credit expiration. The following attest procedures shall be completed for a refinery or importer that possesses credits during an averaging period:
                (1) Obtain a list of all credits in the refiner's or importer's possession at any time during the year being reviewed, identified by the year of creation of the credits.
                (2) If the year being reviewed is 2006 and thereafter, except in the case of gasoline produced for use in the GPA and gasoline produced by small refiners, determine whether any credits identified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section or Type A sulfur allotments created under paragraph (i) of this section and converted to credits were created before 2004, and if so, report as a finding this number of expired credits.

                (3) If the year being reviewed is 2008 and thereafter, determine whether any credits identified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section or Type B sulfur allotments created under paragraph (i) of this section and converted to credits were created more than 5 years before the year being reviewed, and if so, report as a finding this number of expired credits (for example, unused credits created during the 2004 averaging period expire at the end of the 2009 averaging period).
                
                (i) Optional credit and allotment generation in 2003. The following requirements apply to any refinery that generates credits and allotments in 2003 under § 80.275(a):
                (1) Obtain a written representation from the company representative stating the refinery produces gasoline from crude oil.
                (2) Obtain the refinery baseline value from paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the annual volume from paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the annual average sulfur level from paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
                (3) Based on the annual sulfur level and refinery baseline, determine which equation under § 80.275(a)(2) applies.
                (4) Using the applicable equations under § 80.275(a)(2), recalculate the sulfur allotments, by type, and credits and report as a finding.
                (j) Credit reconciliation. The following attest procedures shall be completed each year credits were in the refiner's or importer's possession at any time during the year:
                (1) Obtain the credits remaining or the credit deficit from the previous year from the refiner's or importer's report to EPA for the previous year.
                (2) Compute and report as a finding the net credits remaining at the conclusion of the year being reviewed by totaling:
                (i) Credits remaining from the previous year; plus
                (ii) Credits generated under paragraphs (c), (d) and (i) of this section; plus
                (iii) Allotments generated under paragraph (i) of this section which are converted to credits; plus
                (iv) Credits purchased under paragraph (e) of this section; minus
                (v) Credits sold under paragraph (e) of this section; minus
                (vi) Credits used under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section; minus
                (vii) Credits expiring under paragraph (h) of this section; minus
                (viii) Credit deficit from the previous year.
                (3) Agree the credits remaining or the credit deficit at the conclusion of the year being reviewed with the report to EPA.
                (4) If the refinery or importer had a credit deficit for both the previous year and the year being reviewed, report this fact as a finding.
                (k) Sulfur allotments in 2004 and 2005. The following requirements apply to any refinery or importer that is subject to corporate pool average standards under § 80.195:
                (1) Corporate pool average. (i) Obtain the annual average sulfur level for the refiner or importer from the sulfur report filed with EPA for all gasoline subject to corporate pool standards (all gasoline produced and imported, except that if 50% or greater of the gasoline volume was GPA gasoline the refiner or importer is not subject to the corporate pool average).
                (ii) Compute and report as a finding the company's gasoline volume subject to corporate pool standards and average sulfur level for gasoline subject to corporate pool standards, and agree with the values reported to EPA.
                (2) Allotment generation. (i) For 2004, if the corporate pool average is less than 120 ppm, compute and report as a finding the number and type of sulfur allotments generated in accordance with the applicable provisions under § 80.275(b).

                (iii) If the refiner or importer produced and imported 50% or more of its gasoline for GPA use in 2004 or 2005, no allotments can be generated in that year.
                (3) Allotment purchases and sales. (i) Obtain contracts or other documents for all allotments transferred to another company during the year being reviewed; compute and report as a finding the number of allotments represented in these documents as being transferred away; and agree with the report to EPA.
                (ii) Obtain contracts or other documents for all allotments received during the year being reviewed; compute and report as a finding the number of allotments represented in these documents as being received; and agree with the report to EPA.
                (4) Allotments required. (i) For 2004, if the corporate pool average is greater than 120 ppm, compute and report as a finding the number of allotments required by multiplying the amount the corporate pool average is above 120 ppm times the corporate pool volume, and agree with the report to EPA.
                (ii) For 2005, if the corporate pool average is greater than 90 ppm, compute and report as a finding the number of allotments required by multiplying the amount the corporate pool average is above 90 ppm times the corporate pool volume, and agree with the report to EPA.
                (iii) Obtain the number of allotments used to meet standards for GPA gasoline determined in paragraph (g) of this section.
                (5) Allotment reconciliation. (i) Compute and report as a finding the net allotments remaining at the conclusion of the year being reviewed by totaling allotments:
                (A) Generated under paragraphs (i)(4) and (k)(2) of this section; plus
                (B) Purchased under paragraph (k)(3) of this section; minus
                (C) Sold under paragraph (k)(3) of this section; minus
                (D) Used under paragraph (k)(4) of this section for demonstrating compliance with the corporate pool average.
                (ii) Report as a finding any allotments generated in 2003 or 2004 that are used to meet the corporate pool standards in 2005 that were not reduced to 50% of their original value.
                (iii) If the company's net allotments remaining are less than zero, report this fact as a finding.

                § 80.502
                What definitions apply for purposes of this subpart?
                The definitions of § 80.2 and the following additional definitions apply to this subpart I:
                (a) Entity means any refiner, importer, distributor, retailer or wholesale-purchaser consumer of any distillate fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I).
                (b) Facility means any place, or series of places, where an entity produces, imports, or maintains custody of any distillate fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) from the time it is received to the time custody is transferred to another entity, except as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section:

                (1) Where an entity maintains custody of a batch of diesel fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) from one place in the distribution system to another place (e.g., from a pipeline to a terminal), all owned by the same entity, both places combined are considered to be one single aggregated facility, except where an entity chooses to treat components of such an aggregated facility as separate facilities. The choice made to treat these places as separate facilities may not be changed by the entity during any applicable compliance period. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, where compliance requirements depend upon facility-type, the entire facility must comply with the requirements that apply to its components as follows:
                (i) If an aggregated facility includes a refinery, the entire facility must comply with the requirements applicable to refineries.
                (ii) If an aggregated facility includes a truck loading terminal but not a refinery, the entire facility must comply with the requirements applicable to truck loading terminals.
                (iii) Situations where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal.(A) Where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal, diesel fuel or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I produced by such refinery and distributed over the truck terminal rack must be included in refinery batches that may be based on shipments to a truck terminal rack tank or on the total volumes delivered to tanker trucks for a period not to exceed 1 calendar month per batch.

                (B) Where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal, diesel fuel or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I that were imported or produced by another refinery, and that are distributed through the refinery or truck terminal rack, must be treated as previously designated fuel for which the aggregated facility is responsible for all applicable balance and downgrade requirements under §§ 80.527, 80.598, 80.599 and related recordkeeping and reporting requirements like any other distributor downstream from the refiner or importer.
                
                (2) A refinery or import facility may not be aggregated with facilities that receive fuel from other refineries or import facilities, either directly or indirectly. For example, a refinery may not be aggregated with a terminal that receives any fuel from a common carrier pipeline. However, a refinery may be aggregated with a pipeline and terminal that are owned by the same entity and which receive no fuel from any source other than the refinery. Likewise, a refinery may not be aggregated with a mobile facility that is also carrying another entity's fuel; it may however be aggregated with a mobile facility that does not receive fuel from any source other than the refinery. If a refinery or import facility is aggregated with other facilities, then the aggregated facility is treated as a refinery or import facility.
                (3) Retail outlets or wholesale purchaser consumers may not be aggregated with any other facility.

                (4) Mobile components and mobile facilities. (i) Where an entity maintains custody of diesel fuel in one or more mobile components (e.g., rail, barge, shipping, or trucking operations), the mobile components may be aggregated as a single facility. Mobile components may also be aggregated with a facility from which they receive fuel or a facility to which they deliver fuel. However, mobile components may not be aggregated with both a facility from which they receive fuel and a facility to which they deliver fuel.
                (ii) When an entity maintains title to, but not custody of, diesel fuel in one or more mobile components, the entity may treat the mobile component(s) as a facility under this paragraph (b), but only for the fuel to which the entity has title. In the event that title changes while a mobile component is in transport (but the fuel physically remains in the same mobile facility), the original entity that had title to the fuel continues to be responsible for the designate and track requirements until custody of the fuel is transferred from the mobile facility.
                (5) An individual refinery or contiguous pipeline may not be subdivided into more than one facility. An individual terminal may not be subdivided into more than one facility unless approved by the Administrator.
                (c) Truck loading terminal means any facility that dyes NRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine fuel, pays taxes on motor vehicle diesel fuel per IRS code (26 CFR part 48), or adds a fuel marker pursuant to § 80.510 to heating oil and delivers diesel fuel or heating oil into trucks for delivery to retail or ultimate consumer locations.
                (d) Batch means a quantity of diesel fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) which is homogeneous with regard to those properties that are specified for MVNRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine fuel under this subpart I, has the same designation under this subpart I (if applicable), and whose custody is transferred from one facility to another facility.
                (1) In the case of aggregated facilities consisting of a refinery and a truck loading terminal, a batch may be defined by one of the following methods:
                (i) The sum of the deliveries from the truck loading terminal rack to trucks for periods not to exceed 1 month;
                (ii) Each individual truck or truck compartment; or
                (iii) For refineries with “certification tanks” where testing is performed and “rack tanks” that feed the truck loading terminal rack, each transfer from the certification tank to the rack tank. If this method of determining a batch is selected, it must be the sole method used and must be performed such that no double-counting or undercounting of volumes occurs.
                (2) [Reserved]
                (e) Downstream location means any point in the diesel fuel distribution system that is downstream of refineries and import facilities, for example, diesel fuel at facilities of distributors, carriers, retailers, kerosene blenders, and wholesale purchaser-consumers.
                (f) Definition of PADD. For the purposes of this subpart only, the following definitions of PADDs apply:

                § 80.512
                May an importer treat diesel fuel as blendstock?
                An importer may exclude diesel fuel that it imports from the requirements under this subpart, and instead may designate such diesel fuel as diesel fuel treated as blendstock (DTAB), if all the following conditions are met:
                (a) The DTAB must be included in all applicable designation, credit and compliance calculations for diesel fuel for a refinery operated by the same entity that is the importer . That entity must meet all refiner standards and requirements.
                (b) The importer entity may not transfer title of the DTAB to another entity until the DTAB has been used to produce diesel fuel and all refiner standards and requirements have been met for the diesel fuel produced.

                (c) The refinery at which the DTAB is used to produce diesel fuel must be physically located at either the same terminal at which the DTAB first arrives in the U.S., the import facility, or at a facility to which the DTAB is directly transported from the import facility.
                (d) The DTAB must be completely segregated from any other diesel fuel, including any diesel fuel tank bottoms, prior to the point of blending, sampling and testing in the importer entity's refinery operation. The DTAB may, however, be added to a diesel fuel blending tank where the diesel fuel tank bottom is not included as part of the batch volume for a prior batch. In addition, the DTAB may be placed into a storage tank that contains other DTAB imported by that importer. The DTAB also may be discharged into a tank containing finished diesel fuel of the same category as the diesel fuel which will be produced using the DTAB (for example, 15 ppm sulfur undyed or 15 ppm sulfur dyed diesel fuel) provided the blending process is performed in that same tank.
                (e) The entity must account for the volume of diesel fuel produced using DTAB in a manner that excludes the volume of any previously designated diesel fuel. The diesel fuel tank bottom may not be included in the company's refinery compliance calculations for that batch of diesel fuel if the fuel in that tank bottom has been previously designated by a refiner or importer. This exclusion of previously designated diesel fuel must be accomplished using the following approach:
                (1) Determine the volume of any tank bottom that is previously designated diesel fuel before any diesel fuel production begins.
                (2) Add the DTAB plus any blendstock to the storage tank, and completely mix the tank.
                (3) Determine the volume and sulfur content of the diesel fuel contained in the storage tank after blending is complete. Mathematically subtract the volume of the tank bottom to determine the volume of the DTAB plus blendstock added, and subsequently transferred to another facility. Such fuel is reported to EPA as a batch of diesel fuel under §§ 80.593, 80.601, and 80.604.
                (4) If previously designated motor vehicle diesel fuel having a sulfur content of 15 ppm or less is blended with DTAB, and the combined product after blending has a sulfur content that exceeds 15 ppm, the importer entity, in its capacity as a refiner, must redesignate all the diesel fuel as 500 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel for purposes of the temporary compliance option under § 80.530, or other permissible redesignation under § 80.598. If #2D 15 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel is redesignated as #2D 500 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel, such entity must apply the volume of previously designated 15 ppm sulfur diesel fuel, for purposes of its operations as a distributor, to its downgrading limitation under § 80.527, if applicable, and for volume balancing purposes under § 80.599.
                (5) As an alternative to paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section, where an importer has a blending tank that is used only to combine DTAB and blending components, and no previously designated diesel fuel is added to the tank, the importer entity, in its capacity as a refiner, may account for the diesel fuel produced in such a blending tank by sampling and testing for the sulfur content of the batch after DTAB and blendstock are added and mixed, and reporting the volume of diesel fuel transferred from that tank to a different facility, up to the point where a new blend is produced by adding new DTAB and blendstock.
                (f) The importer must include the volume and sulfur content of each batch of DTAB in the annual importer reports to EPA, as prescribed under §§ 80.593, 80.601, and 80.604, but with a notation that the batch is not included in the importer compliance calculations because the product is DTAB. Any DTAB that ultimately is not used in the importer's refinery operation (for example, a tank bottom of DTAB at the conclusion of the refinery operation), must be treated as newly imported diesel fuel, for which all required sampling and testing, and recordkeeping must be accomplished, and included in the importer's compliance calculations for the averaging period when this sampling and testing occurs.

                (g) The importer must retain records that reflect the importation, sampling and testing, and physical movement of any DTAB, and must make these records available to EPA on request.

                § 80.513
                What provisions apply to transmix processing facilities and pipelines that produce diesel fuel from pipeline interface?
                For purposes of this section, transmix means a mixture of finished fuels, such as pipeline interface, that no longer meets the specifications for a fuel that can be used or sold without further processing or handling. For the purposes of this section, pipeline interface means the mixture between different fuels that abut each other during shipment by pipeline. This section applies to refineries (or other facilities) that produce diesel fuel from transmix by distillation or other refining processes but do not produce diesel fuel by processing crude oil and to pipelines that produce diesel fuel from transmix. This section only applies to the volume of diesel fuel produced from transmix by a transmix processor using these processes, and to the diesel fuel volume produced by a pipeline operator from transmix. This section does not apply to any diesel fuel volume produced by the blending of blendstocks.
                (a) From June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010, motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor is subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(c).
                (b) Beginning June 1, 2010, motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor is subject to the sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1).
                (c) From June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010, NRLM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor is exempt from the standards of § 80.510(a). This paragraph (c) does not apply to NRLM diesel fuel that is sold or intended for sale in the areas listed in § 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2).
                (d) From June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2014, NRLM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the standards under § 80.510(a). This paragraph (d) does not apply to NRLM diesel fuel that is sold or intended for sale in the areas listed in § 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2).
                (e) From June 1, 2014 and beyond, NRLM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor and a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the standards of § 80.510(c).
                (f) From February 25, 2013 through May 31, 2014, LM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix that is sold or intended for sale in the area listed in § 80.510(g)(1) is subject to the standards of § 80.510(a) provided that the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section are satisfied. Diesel fuel produced from transmix that does not meet the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section is subject to the sulfur standard in § 80.510(c).
                (g) Beginning June 1, 2014, LM diesel fuel produced by a transmix processor or a pipeline facility that produces diesel fuel from transmix is subject to the sulfur standard of § 80.510(a), provided that the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section are satisfied. Diesel fuel produced from transmix that does not meet the conditions in paragraph (h) of this section is subject to the sulfur standard in § 80.510(c).
                (h) The following conditions must be satisfied to allow the production of 500 ppm LM under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.
                (1) The fuel must be produced from transmix.

                (2) The fuel must not be sold or intended for sale in the area listed in § 80.510(g)(2) (i.e., Alaska).

                (3) A facility producing 500 ppm LM diesel fuel must obtain approval from the Administrator for a compliance plan. The compliance plan must detail how the facility will segregate any 500 ppm LM diesel fuel produced subject to the standards under § 80.510(a) from the producer through to the ultimate consumer from fuel having other designations. The compliance plan must demonstrate that the end users of 500 ppm LM will also have access to 15 ppm diesel fuel for use in those engines that require the use of 15 ppm diesel fuel. The compliance plan must identify the entities that handle the 500 ppm LM through to the ultimate consumer. No more than 4 separate entities shall handle the 500 ppm LM between the producer and the ultimate consumer. The compliance plan must also identify all ultimate consumers to whom the refiner supplies the 500 ppm LM diesel fuel. The compliance plan must detail how misfueling of 500 ppm LM into vehicles or equipment that require the use of 15 ppm diesel fuel will be prevented.
                (i) Producers of 500 ppm LM diesel fuel must be registered with EPA under § 80.597 prior to the distribution of any 500 ppm LM diesel fuel.
                (ii) Producers of 500 ppm LM must initiate a PTD that meets the requirements in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section.
                (iii) All transfers of 500 ppm LM diesel fuel must be accompanied by a PTD that clearly and accurately states the fuel designation; the PTD must also meet all other requirements of § 80.590.
                (iv) Batches of 500 ppm LM may be shipped by pipeline provided that such batches do not come into physical contact in the pipeline with batches of other distillate fuel products that have a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm.
                (v) The volume of 500 ppm LM shipped via pipeline under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section may swell by no more than 2% upon delivery to the next party. Such a volume increase may only be due to volume swell due to temperature differences when the volume was measured or due to normal pipeline interface cutting practices notwithstanding the requirement under paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of this section.
                (vi) Entities that handle 500 ppm LM must calculate the balance of 500 ppm LM received versus the volume delivered and used on an annual basis.
                (vii) The records required in this section must be maintained for five years, by each entity that handles 500 ppm LM and be made available to EPA upon request.
                (4) All parties that take custody of 500 ppm LM must segregate the product from other fuels and observe the other requirements in the compliance plan approved by EPA pursuant to paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

                What requirements apply to kerosene blenders?
                (a) For purposes of this subpart, a kerosene blender means any refiner who produces NRLM or motor vehicle diesel fuel by adding kerosene to NRLM or motor vehicle diesel fuel downstream of the refinery that produced that fuel or of the import facility where the fuel was imported, without altering the quality or quantity of the fuel in any other manner.
                (b) Kerosene blenders are not subject to the requirements of this subpart applicable to refiners of diesel fuel, but are subject to the requirements and prohibitions applicable to downstream parties.
                (c) For purposes of compliance with §§ 80.524(b)(1) and 80.511(b)(1), the product transfer documents must indicate that the fuel to which kerosene is added complies with the 500 ppm sulfur standard for motor vehicle diesel fuel and is for use only in model year 2006 and older diesel motor vehicles, the fuel is properly downgraded pursuant to the provisions of § 80.527 to motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard, or the applicable NRLM standard.

                § 80.527
                Under what conditions may motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard be downgraded to motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard?
                (a) Definitions. As used in this section, downgrade means changing the designation or classification of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1) to motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(c). A downgrade occurs when the change in designation or classification takes place. Changing the designation or classification of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1) to any designation or classification that is not a motor vehicle diesel fuel is not a downgrade for purposes of this section.
                (b) Who is subject to the downgrade limitation: Any distributor, retailer, or wholesale purchaser consumer that takes custody of any diesel fuel designated or classified as #2D 15 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel and delivers any diesel fuel designated or classified as #2D 500 ppm motor vehicle diesel fuel.
                (c) Downgrading limitation. The provisions of this section apply beginning October 15, 2006.
                (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a person described in paragraph (b) of this section may not downgrade a total of more than 20 percent of the #2D motor vehicle diesel fuel (by volume) that is subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(a)(1) to #2D motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the sulfur standard of § 80.520(c) while such person has custody of such fuel.
                (2) The limitation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies separately to each facility as defined under § 80.502 where there is custody of the fuel when it is downgraded.
                (3) Compliance with the limitation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies separately for the compliance periods of October 15, 2006 through May 31, 2007; June 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008; July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009; July 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010.
                (4) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, compliance with the limitation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be as calculated under § 80.599(e).
                (d) Diesel fuel in violation of the 15 ppm standard. Where motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(a)(1) is found to be in violation of any standard under § 80.520(a) and is consequently downgraded to 500 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel, the person having custody of the fuel at the time it is found to be in violation must include the volume of such downgraded fuel toward its 20 percent volume limitation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the person demonstrates that it did not cause the violation.
                (e) Special provisions for retail outlets and wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers shall comply with the downgrading limitation as follows:
                (1) Retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers who sell, offer for sale, or dispense motor vehicle diesel fuel that is subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1) are exempt from the volume limitations of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
                (2) A retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer who does not sell, offer for sale, or dispense motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1) must comply with the downgrading limitations of paragraph (c) of this section, such that it may not downgrade a volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel, designated as subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard, for more than 20% of the total volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel that it sells, offers for sale, or dispenses in any compliance period.
                (f) Termination of downgrading limitations. The provisions of this section shall not apply after May 31, 2010.

                (a) Beginning June 1, 2006, a refiner or importer may produce or import motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur content standard of § 80.520(c) if all of the following requirements are met:
                (1) Each batch of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur content standard must be designated by the refiner or importer as subject to such standard, pursuant to § 80.598(a).
                (2) The refiner or importer must meet the requirements for product transfer documents in § 80.590 for each batch subject to the 500 ppm sulfur content standard.

                (3)(i) The volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel that is produced or imported during a compliance period (V500, as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, may not exceed the following volume limit:

                (A) For the compliance periods prior to the period from July 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010, 20 percent of the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel that is produced or imported during a compliance period (Vt) plus an additional volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel represented by credits properly generated and used pursuant to the requirements of §§ 80.531 and 80.532.

                (B) For the compliance period from July 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010, 20 percent of the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel that is produced or imported prior to January 1, 2010 during the compliance period (Vt), plus an additional volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel represented by credits properly generated and used pursuant to the requirements of §§ 80.531 and 80.532. From January 1, 2010 through May 31, 2010, the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel that is produced or imported shall not exceed the volume represented by credits used pursuant to § 80.532.
                (ii) The terms V500 and Vt have the meaning specified in § 80.531(a)(2).
                (4) Compliance with the volume limit in paragraph (a)(3) of this section must be determined separately for each refinery. For an importer, such compliance must be determined separately for each Credit Trading Area (as defined in § 80.531) into which motor vehicle diesel fuel is imported. If a party is both a refiner and an importer, such compliance shall be determined separately for the refining and importation activities.

                (5) Compliance with the volume limit in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be determined on an annual basis, where the annual compliance period is from July 1 through June 30. For the year 2006, compliance shall be determined for the period June 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007. For the year 2010, compliance shall be determined for the period of July 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010.

                (6) Any motor vehicle diesel fuel produced or imported above the volume limit in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be subject to the 15 ppm sulfur content standard. However, for any compliance period prior to the compliance period July 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010, a refiner or importer may exceed the volume limit in paragraph (a)(3) of this section by no more than 5 percent of the volume of diesel fuel produced or imported during the compliance period (Vt), provided that for the immediately following compliance period:
                (i) The refiner or importer complies with the volume limit in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; and
                (ii) The refiner or importer produces or imports a volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard, or obtains credits properly generated and used pursuant to the requirements of §§ 80.531 and 80.532 that represent a volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel, equal to the volume of the exceedance for the prior compliance period.
                (b) After May 31, 2010, no refiner or importer may produce or import motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur content standard pursuant to this section.

                § 80.531
                How are motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated?
                (a) Generation of credits from June 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. (1) A refiner or importer may generate credits during the period June 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009, for motor vehicle diesel fuel produced or imported that is designated as subject to the 15 ppm sulfur content standard under § 80.520(a)(1). Credits may be generated only if the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel designated under § 80.598(a) as subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(a) exceeds 80 percent of the total volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced or imported as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

                (2) The number of motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated shall be calculated for each compliance period (as specified in § 80.530(a)(5)) as follows:
                
                C = V1515−(0.80 × Vt)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  C = the positive number of motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated, in gallons.
                  V15 = the total volume in gallons of diesel fuel produced or imported that is designated under § 80.598 as motor vehicle diesel fuel and subject to the standards of § 80.520(a) during the compliance period.
                  Vtn = V15 + V500
                  
                  V500 = the total volume in gallons of diesel fuel produced or imported that is designated under § 80.598(a) as motor vehicle diesel fuel and subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(c) plus the total volume of any other diesel fuel (not including V15, diesel fuel that is dyed in accordance with § 80.520(b) at the refinery or import facility where the diesel fuel is produced or imported, or diesel fuel that is designated as NRLM under § 80.598(a)) represented as having a sulfur content less than or equal to 500 ppm.
                
                
                (3) Credits shall be generated and designated as follows:
                (i) Credits shall be generated separately for each refinery of a refiner.
                (ii) Credits shall be generated separately for each credit trading area (CTA), as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, into which motor vehicle diesel fuel is imported by an importer.
                (iii) Credits shall be designated separately by year of generation and by CTA of generation. In the case of a refiner, credits shall also be designated by refinery, and in the case of an importer, credits shall also be designated by port of import.
                (iv) Credits may not be generated by both a foreign refiner and by an importer for the same motor vehicle diesel fuel.
                (4) Credits shall be generated by a foreign refiner as provided in § 80.620(c) and this section.

                § 80.532
                How are motor vehicle diesel fuel credits used and transferred?
                (a) Credit use stipulations. Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated under § 80.531 may be used to meet the volume limit of § 80.530(a)(3) provided that:
                (1) The motor vehicle diesel fuel credits were generated and reported according to the requirements of this subpart; and
                (2) The conditions of this section are met.
                (b) Use of credits generated under § 80.531. Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated under § 80.531 may be used by a refiner or by an importer to comply with § 80.530 by applying one credit for every gallon of motor vehicle diesel fuel needed to meet compliance with the volume limit of § 80.530(a)(3).
                (c) Credit banking. Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits generated may be banked for use or transfer in a later compliance period or may be transferred to another refiner or importer for use as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (d) Credit transfers. (1) Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits obtained from another refiner or from another importer, including early motor vehicle diesel fuel credits and small refiner motor vehicle diesel fuel credits as described in § 80.531(b) through (e), may be used to satisfy the volume limit of § 80.530(a)(3) if all the following conditions are met:
                (i) The motor vehicle diesel fuel credits were generated in the same CTA as the CTA in which motor vehicle diesel fuel credits are used to achieve compliance, except as provided in § 80.531(c)(5);
                (ii) The motor vehicle diesel fuel credits are used in compliance with the time period limitations for credit use in this subpart;
                (iii) Any credit transfer takes place no later than the August 31 following the compliance period when the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits are used;
                (iv) No credit may be transferred more than twice, as follows: The first transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the credit may only be made to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit; if the transferee cannot use the credit, it may make a second and final transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit. In no case may a credit be transferred more than twice before being used or terminated;
                (v) The credit transferor must apply any motor vehicle diesel fuel credits necessary to meet the transferor's annual compliance requirements before transferring motor vehicle diesel fuel credits to any other refinery or importer;
                (vi) No motor vehicle diesel fuel credits may be transferred that would result in the transferor having a negative credit balance; and
                (vii) Each transferor must supply to the transferee records indicating the year the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits were generated, the identity of the refiner (and refinery) or importer who generated the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits, the CTA of credit generation, and the identity of the transferring entity, if it is not the same entity who generated the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits.
                (2) In the case of motor vehicle diesel fuel credits that have been calculated or created improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, the following provisions apply:
                (i) Invalid motor vehicle diesel fuel credits cannot be used to achieve compliance with the transferee's volume requirements regardless of the transferee's good faith belief that the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits were valid.
                (ii) The refiner or importer who used the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits, and any transferor of the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits, must adjust their credit records, reports and compliance calculations as necessary to reflect the proper motor vehicle diesel fuel credits.
                (iii) Any properly created motor vehicle diesel fuel credits existing in the transferor's credit balance after correcting the credit balance, and after the transferor applies motor vehicle diesel fuel credits as needed to meet the compliance requirements at the end of the compliance period, must first be applied to correct the invalid transfers before the transferor trades or banks the motor vehicle diesel fuel credits.
                (e) Limitations on credit use. (1) Motor vehicle diesel fuel credits may not be used to achieve compliance with any requirements of this subpart other than the volume limit of § 80.530(a)(3), unless specifically approved by the Administrator pursuant to a hardship relief petition under § 80.560 or 80.561.
                (2) A refiner or importer possessing motor vehicle diesel fuel credits must use all motor vehicle diesel fuel credits in its possession prior to applying the credit deficit provisions of § 80.530(a)(6).
                (3) No motor vehicle diesel fuel credits may be used to meet compliance with this subpart subsequent to the compliance period ending May 31, 2010.

                § 80.535
                How are NRLM diesel fuel credits generated?
                (a) Generation of high sulfur NRLM credits from June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007. (1) During the period June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007, a refiner or importer may generate credits pursuant to the provisions of this section if all of the following conditions are met:
                (i) The refiner or importer notifies EPA of its intention to generate credits and the period during which it will generate credits. This notification must be received by EPA at least 30 calendar days prior to the date it begins generating credits under this section.
                (ii) Each batch or partial batch of NRLM diesel fuel for which credits are claimed shall be subject to all of the provisions of this subpart for NRLM diesel fuel as if it had been produced after June 1, 2007 and before June 1, 2010.
                (iii) The number of high-sulfur NRLM credits (HSC) that are generated shall be a positive number.
                (2) The refiner or importer shall choose one of the following methods for calculating credits for each calculation period.
                (i) For fuel that is dyed under the provisions of § 80.520, HSC equals the volume of fuel in gallons produced or imported during the period identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that is designated as NRLM diesel fuel and that is subject to and complies with the provisions of § 80.510(a); or

                (ii) For dyed or undyed fuel that complies with the provisions of § 80.598 for a calculation period of June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007, determine HSC as follows:
                
                HSC = V510 + V520 − BMV
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  V510 = The total volume of NRLM diesel fuel produced or imported during the annual calculation period that complies with the standards of § 80.510(a) or (b).
                  
                  V520 = The total volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced or imported during the annual calculation period that complies with the standards of § 80.520(a) or (c).
                  BMV = As calculated in § 80.533(d)(1).
                
                
                (3) High-sulfur NRLM credits shall be generated and designated as follows:
                (i) Credits shall be generated separately for each refiner or importer.
                (ii) Credits may not be generated by both a foreign refiner and by an importer for the same motor vehicle diesel fuel.
                (iii) Credits shall not be generated under both § 80.531 and this section for the same diesel fuel.
                (iv) Any credits generated by a foreign refiner shall be generated as provided in § 80.620(c) and this section.
                (4) No credits may be generated under this paragraph (a) after May 31, 2007.

                (5) Any fuel for which a refiner or importer wishes to generate credits must be designated as 500 ppm sulfur NRLM diesel fuel when delivered to the next entity. The refiner may not designate the fuel as 500 ppm sulfur with the intent that it be mixed by the next entity with a batch of distillate with a higher sulfur level to create a fuel with a classification other than 500 ppm sulfur or the classification of the fuel it is mixed with (e.g., it cannot mix fuel designated as 500 ppm sulfur with fuel classified as high sulfur to produce a fuel classified as 2000 ppm sulfur to meet state or local sulfur limits).
                (6) The refiner or importer must submit a report to the Administrator no later than July 31, 2007. The report must demonstrate that all the NRLM diesel fuel produced or imported which generated credits met the applicable requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section. If the Administrator finds that such credits did not in fact meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section, as applicable, or if the Administrator determines that there is insufficient information to determine the validity of such credits, the Administrator may deny the credits submitted in whole or in part.
                (b) Generation of high-sulfur NRLM credits by small refiners from June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010. (1) Notwithstanding the dates specified in paragraph (a) of this section, during the period from June 1, 2006 through May 31, 2010, a refiner that is approved by the EPA as a small refiner under § 80.551 may generate credits under paragraph (a) of this section during any compliance period as specified under § 80.599(a)(2) for diesel fuel produced or imported that is designated as NRLM diesel fuel and complies with the provisions of § 80.510(a).
                (2) The small refiner must submit a report to the Administrator no later than August 31 after the end of each calculation period during which credits were generated. The report must demonstrate that all the NRLM diesel fuel produced or imported which generated credits met the applicable requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section. If the Administrator finds that such credits did not in fact meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section, as applicable, or if the Administrator determines that there is insufficient information to determine the validity of such credits, the Administrator may deny the credits submitted in whole or in part.
                (3) In addition, a foreign refiner that is approved by the Administrator to generate credits under § 80.554 shall comply with the requirements of § 80.620.

                (i) Credits shall be generated separately for each refiner or importer.
                (ii) Credits may not be generated by both a foreign refiner and by an importer for the same diesel fuel.
                (iii) Credits shall not be generated under both § 80.531 and this section for the same diesel fuel.
                (iv) Any credits generated by a foreign refiner shall be generated as provided in § 80.620(c) and this section.
                (3) No credits may be generated under this paragraph (c) after May 31, 2010.
                (4) The refiner or importer must submit a report to the Administrator no later than August 31, 2010. The report must demonstrate that all the 15 ppm sulfur NRLM diesel fuel produced or imported which generated credits met the applicable requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. If the Administrator finds that such credits did not in fact meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, as applicable, or if the Administrator determines that there is insufficient information to determine the validity of such credits, the Administrator may deny the credits submitted in whole or in part.
                (d) Generation of 500 ppm sulfur NRLM credits by small refiners from June 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013. (1) Notwithstanding the dates specified in paragraph (c) of this section, during the period from June 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013, a refiner that is approved by the EPA as a small refiner under § 80.551 may generate credits under paragraph (c) of this section during any compliance period as specified under § 80.599(a)(2) for diesel fuel produced or imported that is designated as NR or NRLM diesel fuel and complies with the provisions of § 80.510(b) or (c).
                (2) The small refiner must submit a report to the Administrator no later than August 31 after the end of each calculation period during which credits were generated. The report must demonstrate that all the 15 ppm sulfur NR or NRLM diesel fuel produced or imported for which credits were generated met the applicable requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. If the Administrator finds that such credits did not in fact meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, as applicable, or if the Administrator determines that there is insufficient information to determine the validity of such credits, the Administrator may deny the credits submitted in whole or in part.

                § 80.536
                How are NRLM diesel fuel credits used and transferred?
                (a) Credit use stipulations. Credits generated under § 80.535(a) and (b) may be used to meet the NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of § 80.510(a), and credits generated under 80.535(c) and (d) may be used to meet the NR and NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of 80.510(b) and (c), respectively, provided that:
                (1) The credits were generated and reported according to the requirements of this subpart; and
                (2) The conditions of this section are met.
                (b) Using credits generated under § 80.535. Credits generated under § 80.535 may be used by a refiner or an importer to comply with the diesel fuel standards of § 80.510 (a), (b), and (c) by applying one credit for every gallon of diesel fuel that does not comply with the applicable standard.
                (c) Credit banking. Credits generated may be banked for use at a later time or may be transferred to any other refiner or importer nationwide for use as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
                (d) Credit transfers. (1) Credits generated under § 80.535 that are obtained from another refiner or importer may be used to comply with the diesel fuel sulfur standards of § 80.510(a), (b), and (c) if all the following conditions are met:
                (i) The credits are used in compliance with the time period limitations for credit use in this subpart;
                (ii) Any credit transfer is completed no later than August 31 following the compliance period when the credits are used to comply with a standard under paragraph (a) of this section;
                (iii) No credit is transferred more than twice, as follows:
                (A) The first transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the credit may only be made to a refiner or importer that intends to use the credit; if the transferee cannot use the credit, it may make a second and final transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit; and
                (B) In no case may a credit be transferred more than twice before it is used or it expires;
                (iv) The credit transferor applies any credits necessary to meet the transferor's annual compliance requirements before transferring credits to any other refinery or importer;
                (v) No credits are transferred that would result in the transferor having a negative credit balance; and
                (vi) Each transferor supplies to the transferee records indicating the year the credits were generated, the identity of the refiner (and refinery) or importer that generated the credits, and the identity of the transferor, if it is not the same party that generated the credits.
                (2) In the case of credits that have been calculated or created improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, the following provisions apply:
                (i) Invalid credits cannot be used to achieve compliance with the transferee's volume requirements regardless of the transferee's good faith belief that the credits were valid.
                (ii) The refiner or importer that used the credits, and any transferor of the credits, must adjust its credit records, reports and compliance calculations as necessary to reflect the proper credits.
                (iii) Any properly created credits existing in the transferor's credit balance after correcting the credit balance, and after the transferor applies credits as needed to meet the compliance requirements at the end of the calendar year, must first be applied to correct the invalid transfers before the transferor trades or banks the credits.
                (e) General limitation on credit use. Credits may not be used to achieve compliance with any requirements of this subpart other than the standards of § 80.510(a), (b), and (c), unless specifically approved by the Administrator pursuant to a hardship relief petition under § 80.560 or § 80.561.
                (f) Use of high sulfur NRLM credits. (1) High sulfur NRLM credits generated under § 80.535(a) or (b) may be used on a one-for-one basis to meet the NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of § 80.510(a) from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010. For example, one credit generated by the production or importation of one gallon of NRLM diesel fuel subject to the NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of § 80.510 (a) may be used to produce or import one gallon of NRLM diesel fuel that is exempt from the sulfur standard of § 80.510(a) during the period from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010.
                (2) Any high sulfur NRLM diesel fuel produced after June 1, 2007 through the use of credits must—
                (i) Be dyed red under the provisions of § 80.520 at the point of production or importation;
                (ii) Be associated with a product transfer document that bears a unique product code as specified in § 80.590; and
                (iii) Not be used to sell or deliver diesel fuel into areas specified in § 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2).
                (3) No high sulfur NRLM credits may be used subsequent to the compliance period ending May 31, 2010.
                (4) Any high sulfur NRLM credits not used under the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be converted into 500 ppm sulfur NRLM credits on a one-for-one basis for use under paragraph (g) of this section.
                (g) Use of 500 ppm sulfur NRLM credits. (1) 500 ppm sulfur NRLM credits generated under § 80.535(c) or (d) or converted from high sulfur NRLM credits under paragraph (f)(3) of this section may be used on a one-for-one basis to meet the NR or NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standards of § 80.510(b) or (c) from June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2014. For example, one credit generated by the production or importation of one gallon of NRLM diesel fuel subject to the NRLM diesel fuel sulfur standard of § 80.510 (c) may be used to produce or import one gallon of NR diesel fuel that is subject to the sulfur standard of § 80.510(a) during the period from June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2014.
                (2) Any 500 ppm sulfur NR or NRLM diesel fuel produced or imported after June 1, 2010 through the use of these credits must—
                (i) Bear a unique product code as specified in § 80.590; and
                (ii) Not be used to sell or deliver diesel fuel into areas specified in § 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2).
                (3) No 500 ppm sulfur NRLM credits may be used after May 31, 2014.

              Geographic Phase-In Provisions
              
                § 80.540
                How may a refiner be approved to produce gasoline under the GPA gasoline sulfur standards in 2007 and 2008?
                (a) A refiner that has been approved by EPA under § 80.217 for the geographic phase-in area (GPA) gasoline sulfur content standards under § 80.216 may apply to EPA for approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA standards in 2007 and 2008. Such application shall be submitted to EPA, at the address provided in § 80.595(b), by December 31, 2001. A foreign refiner must apply under the provisions of paragraph (n) of this section.
                (b) The refiner must submit an application in accordance with the provisions of §§ 80.595 and 80.596. The application must also include information, as provided in § 80.594(c), demonstrating that starting no later than June 1, 2006, 95 percent of the motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by the refinery for United States use will comply with the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1), and that the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced will comply with the volume requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
                (c) The Administrator may approve a refiner's application to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards in 2007 and 2008 if the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are satisfied. In approving an application, the Administrator shall establish a motor vehicle diesel fuel volume baseline under §§ 80.595 and 80.596.
                (d) From June 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008, 95 percent of the motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a refiner that has been approved under paragraph (c) of this section to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur standards in 2007 and 2008, must be accurately designated under § 80.598 as meeting the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(a)(1).
                (e) The total volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel produced for use in the United States and designated as meeting the 15 ppm sulfur standard under paragraph (d) of this section must meet or exceed 85 percent of the baseline volume established under paragraph (c) of this section, except that for the first compliance period from June 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007, the total volume must meet or exceed 92 percent of the baseline volume.
                (f) Compliance with the volume requirements in paragraph (e) of this section shall be determined each compliance period. Annual compliance periods shall be from July 1 through June 30. For the year 2006, the compliance period shall be from June 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007.

                (g) If a refiner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, or if the approval of the application, including the baseline, was based on false or inaccurate information, the approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards under this section during the years 2007 and 2008 shall be void ab initio, and gasoline produced for use in the GPA must meet the gasoline sulfur content standards of subpart H of this Part as if there had been no approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards in 2007 and 2008.
                
                (h) If for any compliance period a refiner fails to meet the volume requirements in paragraph (e) of this section, the approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards shall be void for that compliance period and for all succeeding compliance periods, and gasoline produced for use in the GPA must meet the gasoline sulfur standards under subpart H of this subpart as if there had been no approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards under this section in 2007 and 2008.
                (i) A refiner that is approved for production of gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur standards under this section in 2007 and 2008 must meet all applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements of §§ 80.592, 80.593, and 80.594, and shall meet all the recordkeeping and reporting requirements under §§ 80.219, 80.365 and 80.370.
                (j) A refiner approved to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur standards under this section in 2007 and 2008 may not generate or use credits under § 80.531(a) or (e), or § 80.532 unless the approval is vacated as provided in paragraph (k) of this section.
                (k) A refiner may petition the Administrator to vacate approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards in 2007 and 2008. EPA may grant such a petition, effective January 1 of the compliance period following EPA's receipt of such petition (or effective June 1, in 2006, if applicable). Upon such effective date and thereafter, gasoline produced for use in the GPA must meet the gasoline sulfur content standards under subpart H of this Part as if there had been no approval to produce gasoline subject to the GPA gasoline sulfur content standards under this section in 2007 and 2008. Upon such effective date, the refiner shall not be subject to the requirements of this section.
                (l) The provisions of this section shall apply separately for each refinery of a refiner.
                (m) If any refinery is approved for production of gasoline subject to GPA gasoline sulfur content standards under this section in 2007 and 2008, the GPA downstream gasoline sulfur standard under § 80.220(a)(2) shall apply as follows:
                (1) During the period of February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2009, the sulfur content of GPA gasoline at any downstream location other than at a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility shall not exceed 326 ppm.
                (2) During the period of March 1, 2005 through February 28, 2009, the sulfur content of GPA gasoline at any downstream location shall not exceed 326 ppm.
                (n) A foreign refiner may apply to the Administrator to produce gasoline that is subject to the gasoline sulfur standards for GPA gasoline under § 80.216 for the compliance years 2007 and 2008. Such application must be submitted to the EPA, at the address in § 80.595(b), by December 31, 2001.
                (1) The Administrator may approve such interim GPA gasoline sulfur standards for the foreign refiner provided that the foreign refiner applies for a gasoline sulfur baseline under paragraph (n)(2) of this section and complies with:
                (i) The requirements of paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section;
                (ii) The requirements for the import of motor vehicle diesel fuel under § 80.620; and
                (iii) All applicable gasoline requirements for refiners under subpart H of this Part, including the foreign refiner requirements under § 80.410, the attest requirements of § 80.415, the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of §§ 80.365 and 80.370, the designation and product transfer document requirements of § 80.219, the sampling and testing requirements of § 80.330, and the sample retention requirements of § 80.335.
                (2) The refiner must submit an application for a gasoline sulfur baseline under the provisions of §§ 80.216(a), 80.295, and 80.410(b).
                (3) After review of the foreign refiner's individual refinery gasoline sulfur baseline, its individual refinery motor vehicle diesel fuel baseline, and other information submitted with the application, the Administrator may approve such baselines and the application for GPA gasoline sulfur standards for 2007 and 2008.

                (o) An importer is not eligible for approval to import gasoline subject to the GPA standards in 2007 or 2008 under this section.

                (2)(i) For a refiner meeting the conditions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, beginning January 1, 2004, the applicable small refiner's annual average and per-gallon cap gasoline sulfur standards will be the standards of § 80.240(a) increased by a factor of 1.20 for the duration of the refiner's small refiner gasoline sulfur standards under § 80.240(a) or § 80.553 (i.e., through calendar years 2007 or 2010).
                (ii) In no case may the per-gallon cap exceed 450 ppm.
                (3)(i) If the refiner fails to produce the necessary volume of 15 ppm sulfur MVNRLM diesel fuel by June 1, 2006 and every year thereafter through the deadlines specified under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the refiner must report this in its annual report under § 80.604, and the adjustment of gasoline sulfur standards under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section will be considered void as of January 1, 2004.
                (ii) If such a refiner had produced gasoline above its interim gasoline sulfur standard of § 80.240(a) prior to June 1, 2006, such fuel will not be considered in violation of the small refiner standards under § 80.240(a), provided the refiner obtains and uses a quantity of gasoline sulfur credits equal to the volume of gasoline exceeding the small refiner standards multiplied by the number of parts per million by which the gasoline exceeded the small refiner standards.
                (e) Multiple refineries. The provisions of this section shall apply separately for each refinery owned or operated by a NRLM diesel fuel small refiner.
                (f) Other provisions. From June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010, a refiner who is an approved motor vehicle diesel fuel small refiner under § 80.550(a) but does not qualify as a NRLM diesel fuel small refiner under § 80.550(b) may produce NRLM diesel fuel that is exempt from the per-gallon sulfur standard and the cetane or aromatics standard of § 80.510(a). This exemption does not apply to diesel fuel sold or intended for sale in the areas listed in § 80.510(g)(1) or (g)(2). From June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2012, NR and LM diesel fuel produced by such refiners is subject to the standards under § 80.510(b) and beginning June 1, 2012, all NRLM diesel fuel is subject to the standards under § 80.510(c).

              Other Hardship Provisions
              
                § 80.560
                How can a refiner seek temporary relief from the requirements of this subpart in case of extreme hardship circumstances?
                (a) EPA may, at its discretion, grant a refiner of crude oil that processes crude oil through refinery processing units, for one or more of its refineries, temporary relief from some or all of the provisions of this subpart. Such relief shall be no less stringent than the small refiner compliance options specified in § 80.552 for motor vehicle diesel fuel and § 80.554 for NRLM diesel fuel. EPA may grant such relief provided that the refiner demonstrates that—
                (1) Unusual circumstances exist that impose extreme hardship and significantly affect the refiner's ability to comply by the applicable date; and
                (2) It has made best efforts to comply with the requirements of this subpart.
                (b)(1) For motor vehicle diesel fuel, applications must be submitted to EPA by June 1, 2002 to the following address: U.S. EPA—Attn: Diesel Hardship, Transportation and Regional Programs Division (6406J), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460 (certified mail/return receipt) or Attn: Diesel Hardship, Transportation and Regional Programs Division, 1310 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20005 (express mail/return receipt). EPA reserves the right to deny applications for appropriate reasons, including unacceptable environmental impact. Approval to distribute motor vehicle diesel fuel not subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard may be granted for such time period as EPA determines is appropriate, but shall not extend beyond May 31, 2010.
                (2) For NRLM diesel fuel, applications must be submitted to EPA by June 1, 2005 to the following address: U.S. EPA—Attn: Diesel Hardship, Transportation and Regional Programs Division (6406J), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460 (certified mail/return receipt) or Attn: Diesel Hardship, Transportation and Regional Programs Division, 1310 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20005 (express mail/return receipt). EPA reserves the right to deny applications for appropriate reasons, including unacceptable environmental impact. Approval to distribute NRLM diesel fuel not subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard may be granted for such time period as EPA determines is appropriate, but shall not extend beyond May 31, 2010 for NR diesel fuel and May 31, 2012 for NRLM diesel fuel. Approval to distribute NRLM diesel fuel not subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard may be granted for such time period as EPA determines is appropriate, but shall not extend beyond May 31, 2014.

                (c) Applications must include a plan demonstrating how the refiner will comply with the requirements of this subpart as expeditiously as possible. The plan shall include a showing that contracts are or will be in place for engineering and construction of desulfurization equipment a plan for applying for and obtaining any permits necessary for construction or operation, projected timeline for beginning and completing construction, and for beginning actual operation of such equipment, and a description of plans to obtain necessary capital, and a detailed estimate of when the requirements of this subpart will be met.
                (d) Applicants must provide, at a minimum, the following information:
                (1) Detailed description of efforts to obtain capital for refinery investments and efforts made to obtain credits for compliance under § 80.531 for motor vehicle diesel fuel or §§ 80.535 through 80.536 for NRLM diesel fuel;
                (2) Bond rating of entity that owns the refinery (in the case of joint ventures, include the bond rating of the joint venture entity and the bond ratings of all partners; in the case of corporations, include the bond ratings of any parent or subsidiary corporations); and
                (3) Estimated capital investment needed to comply with the requirements of this subpart by the applicable date.
                (e) In addition to the application requirements of paragraph (b) through (d) of this section, a refiner's application for temporary relief under this paragraph (e) must also include a compliance plan. Such compliance plan shall demonstrate how the refiner will engage in a quality assurance testing program, where appropriate, to ensure that the following conditions are met:
                (1)(i) Its motor vehicle diesel fuel subject solely to the sulfur standards under § 80.520(c) has not caused motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard § 80.520(a)(1) to fail to comply with that standard; or
                (ii) Its NRLM diesel fuel subject solely to the 500 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(a) has not caused NRLM diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(b) or (c) to fail to comply with that standard.
                (2) The quality assurance program must at least include periodic sampling and testing at the party's own facilities and at downstream facilities in the refiner's or importer's diesel fuel distribution system, to determine compliance with the applicable sulfur standards for both categories of motor vehicle diesel fuel; examination at the party's own facilities and at applicable downstream facilities, of product transfer documents to confirm appropriate transfers and deliveries of both products; and inspection of retailer and wholesale purchaser-consumer pump stands for the presence of the labels and warning signs required under this section. Any violations that are discovered shall be reported to EPA within 48 hours of discovery.
                (f) Applications under this section must be accompanied by:
                (1) A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the application is true to the best of his/her knowledge.
                (2) The name, address, phone number, facsimile number and e-mail address of a corporate contact person.
                (g) Applicants must also provide any other relevant information requested by EPA.
                (h) Refiners who are granted a hardship relief standard for any refinery and importers of fuel subject to temporary foreign refiner relief standards, must comply with the requirements of § 80.561(f).
                (i) EPA may impose any reasonable conditions on waivers under this section, including limitations on the refinery's volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel and NRLM diesel fuel subject to temporary refiner relief standards.
                (j) The provisions of this section are available only to refineries that produce diesel fuel from crude.

                (k) The individual refinery sulfur standard and the compliance plan will be approved or disapproved by the Administrator, and approval will be effective when the refiner receives an approval letter from EPA. Unless approved, the refiner or, where applicable, the importer must comply with the motor vehicle diesel fuel standard under § 80.520(a)(1) by the appropriate compliance date specified in § 80.500 or the NRLM diesel fuel standards and compliance dates under § 80.510(a), (b), and (c) as applicable.

                (l) If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information on its application for hardship relief, EPA's approval of the refiners application will be void ab initio.

                § 80.561
                How can a refiner or importer seek temporary relief from the requirements of this subpart in case of extreme unforeseen circumstances?
                In appropriate extreme, unusual, and unforseen circumstances (for example, natural disaster or refinery fire) which are clearly outside the control of the refiner or importer and which could not have been avoided by the exercise of prudence, diligence, and due care, EPA may permit a refiner or importer, for a brief period, to distribute motor vehicle diesel fuel or NRLM diesel fuel which does not meet the requirements of this subpart if:
                (a) It is in the public interest to do so (e.g., distribution of the nonconforming diesel fuel is necessary to meet projected shortfalls which cannot otherwise be compensated for);
                (b) The refiner or importer exercised prudent planning and was not able to avoid the violation and has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of the nonconformity;
                (c) The refiner or importer can show how the requirements for motor vehicle diesel fuel or NRLM diesel fuel will be expeditiously achieved;
                (d) The refiner or importer agrees to make up any air quality detriment associated with the nonconforming motor vehicle diesel fuel or NRLM diesel fuel, where practicable;
                (e) The refiner or importer pays to the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to the economic benefit of the nonconformity minus the amount expended pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, in making up the air quality detriment; and
                (f)(1) In the case of motor vehicle diesel fuel distributed under this section that does not meet the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1), such diesel fuel shall not be distributed for use in model year 2007 or later motor vehicles, and must meet all the requirements and prohibitions of this subpart applicable to diesel fuel meeting the sulfur standard under § 80.520(c), or to diesel fuel that is not motor vehicle diesel fuel, as applicable.
                (2) In the case of NRLM diesel fuel distributed under this section from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010 that does not meet the 500 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(a), such diesel fuel must meet the requirements and prohibitions applicable to high sulfur NRLM credit fuel under § 80.536(f)(1)(i) and (ii).
                (3) In the case of NR diesel fuel distributed under this section after May 31, 2010 that does not meet the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(b), such diesel fuel shall not be distributed for use in model year 2011 or later nonroad engines, and must meet all the requirements and prohibitions of this subpart applicable to diesel fuel meeting the sulfur standard under § 80.510(a) for NRLM diesel fuel.
                (4) In the case of NRLM diesel fuel distributed under this section after May 31, 2012 that does not meet the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(c), such diesel fuel shall not be distributed for use in model year 2011 or later nonroad engines, and must meet all the requirements and prohibitions of this subpart applicable to diesel fuel meeting the sulfur standard under § 80.510(a) for NRLM diesel fuel.

                § 80.581
                What are the batch testing and sample retention requirements for motor vehicle diesel fuel, NRLM diesel fuel, and ECA marine fuel?
                (a) Beginning on June 1, 2006 (or earlier pursuant to § 80.531), for motor vehicle diesel fuel, and beginning June 1, 2010 (or earlier pursuant to § 80.535), for NRLM diesel fuel, and beginning June 1, 2014, for ECA marine fuel, each refiner and importer shall collect a representative sample from each batch of motor vehicle or NRLM diesel fuel produced or imported and subject to the 15 ppm sulfur content standard, or ECA marine fuel subject to the 1,000 ppm sulfur content standard. Batch, for the purposes of this section, means batch as defined under § 80.2 but without the reference to transfer of custody from one facility to another facility.

                (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the refiner or importer shall test each sample collected pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to determine its sulfur content for compliance with the requirements of this subpart prior to the diesel fuel leaving the refinery or import facility, using an appropriate sampling and testing method as specified in § 80.580.
                
                (c)(1) Any refiner who produces motor vehicle, NRLM diesel fuel, or ECA marine fuel using computer-controlled in-line blending equipment, including the use of an on-line analyzer test method that is approved under the provisions of § 80.580, and who, subsequent to the production of the diesel fuel batch tests a composited sample of the batch under the provisions of § 80.580 for purposes of designation and reporting, is exempt from the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section to obtain the test result required under this section prior to the diesel fuel leaving the refinery, provided that the refiner obtains approval from EPA. The requirement of this paragraph (c)(1) that the in-line blending equipment must include an on-line analyzer test method that is approved under the provisions of § 80.580 is effective beginning June 1, 2006.
                (2) To obtain an exemption from paragraph (b) of this section, the refiner must submit to EPA all the information required under § 80.65(f)(4)(i)(A). A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this paragraph (c)(2).
                (3) Refiners who seek an exemption under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must comply with any request by EPA for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption.
                (4) Within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a submission under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, EPA will notify the refiner if the exemption is not approved or of any deficiencies in the refiner's submission, or if any additional information is required or other requirements are included in the exemption pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In the absence of such notification from EPA, the effective date of an exemption under this paragraph (c) is 60 days from EPA's receipt of the refiner's submission.

                (5) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under this paragraph (c), in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the refiner's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the sulfur content of the refinery's diesel fuel production, or if EPA determines that any other circumstances exist which merit modification of the requirements of an exemption, such as advancements in the state of the art for in-line blending measurement which allow for additional control or more accurate monitoring or documentation of sulfur content. If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the refiner's exemption will be void ab initio.
                
                (d) All test results under this section shall be retained for five years and must be provided to EPA upon request.
                (e) Samples collected under this section must be retained for at least 30 days and provided to EPA upon request.

                § 80.582
                What are the sampling and testing methods for the fuel marker?
                For heating oil and NRLM diesel fuel subject to the fuel marker requirement in § 80.510(d), (e), or (f), the identification of the presence and concentration of the fuel marker in diesel fuel may be determined using the test procedures qualified in accordance with the requirements in this section.
                (a) Sampling and testing for methods for the fuel marker. The sampling, sample preparation, and testing methods qualified for use in accordance with the requirements of this section may involve the use of hazardous materials, operations and equipment. This section does not address the associated safety problems which may exist. It is the responsibility of the user of the procedures specified in this section to establish appropriate safety and health practices prior to their use. It is also the responsibility of the user to dispose of any byproducts which might result from conducting these procedures in a manner consistent with applicable safety and health requirements.
                (b) What are the precision and accuracy criteria for qualification of fuel marker test methods?—(1) Precision. A standard deviation of less than 0.10 milligrams per liter is required, computed from the results of a minimum of 20 repeat tests made over 20 days on samples taken from a homogeneous commercially available diesel fuel which meets the applicable industry consensus and federal regulatory specifications and which contains the fuel marker at a concentration in the range of 0.10 to 8 milligrams per liter. In order to qualify, the 20 results must be a series of tests on the same material and there must be a sequential record of the analysis with no omissions. A laboratory facility may exclude a given sample or test result only if the exclusion is for a valid reason under good laboratory practices and it maintains records regarding the sample and test results and the reason for excluding them.
                (2) Accuracy. (i) The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available marker solvent yellow 124 standard in the range of 0.10 to 1 milligrams per liter shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by more than 0.05 milligrams per liter.
                (ii) The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available marker solvent yellow 124 standard in the range of 4 to 10 milligrams per liter shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by more than 0.05 milligrams per liter.
                (iii) In applying the tests of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, individual test results shall be compensated for any known chemical interferences.
                (c) What process must a test facility follow in order to qualify a test method for determining the fuel marker content of distillate fuels and how will EPA qualify or decline to qualify a test method?—(1) Qualification of test methods approved by voluntary consensus-based standards bodies. Any standard test method developed by a Voluntary Consensus-Based Standards Body, such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) or International Standards Organization (ISO), shall be considered a qualified test method for determining the fuel marker content of distillate fuel provided that it meets the precision and accuracy criteria under paragraph (b) of this section. The qualification of a test method is limited to the single test facility that performed the testing for accuracy and precision. The individual facility must submit the accuracy and precision results for each method, including information on the date and time of each test measurement used to demonstrate precision, following procedures established by the Administrator.
                (2) Qualification of test methods that have not been approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body. A test method that has not been approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body may be qualified upon approval by the Administrator. The following information must be submitted in the application for approval by each test facility, for each test method that it wishes to have approved:
                (i) Full test method documentation, including a description of the technology and/or instrumentation that makes the method functional.
                (ii) Information demonstrating that the test method meets the accuracy and precision criteria under paragraph (b) of this section, including information on the date and time of each test measurement used to demonstrate precision.
                (iii) Samples used for precision and accuracy determination must be retained for 90 days.
                (iv) If requested by the Administrator, test results utilizing the method and performed on a sample of commercially available distillate fuel which meets the applicable industry consensus and federal regulatory specifications and which contains the fuel marker.
                (v) Any additional information requested by the Administrator and necessary to render a decision as to qualification of the test method.
                (vi) The qualification of a test method is limited to the single test facility that performed the testing for accuracy and precision and any other required testing.

                (3)(i) Within 90 days of receipt of all materials required to be submitted under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the Administrator shall determine whether to qualify the test method under this section. The Administrator shall qualify the test method if all materials required under this section are received and the test method meets the accuracy and precision criteria of paragraph (b) of this section.
                (ii) If the Administrator denies approval of the test method, within 90 days of receipt of all materials required to be submitted under this section, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the reasons for not approving the method. If the Administrator does not notify the applicant within 90 days of receipt of the application, that the test method is not approved, then the test method shall be deemed approved.

                (iii) If the Administrator finds that an individual test facility has provided false or inaccurate information under this section, upon notice from the Administrator, the qualification shall be void ab initio.
                
                (iv) The qualification of any test method under this paragraph (c) shall be valid for the duration of the period during which the fuel marker requirements remain applicable under this subpart.
                (d) Quality control procedures for fuel marker measurement instrumentation. A test shall not be considered a test using a qualified test method unless the following quality control procedures are performed separately for each instrument used to make measurements:

                (1) Follow all mandatory provisions of ASTM D 6299-02 and construct control charts from the mandatory quality control testing prescribed in paragraph 7.1 of the reference method, following guidelines under A 1.5.1 for individual observation charts and A 1.5.2 for moving range charts. The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by reference of ASTM D 6299-02, Standard Practice for Applying Statistical Quality Assurance Techniques to Evaluate Analytical Measurement System Performance, as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

                § 80.583
                What alternative sampling and testing requirements apply to importers who transport motor vehicle diesel fuel, NRLM diesel fuel, or ECA marine fuel by truck or rail car?

                Importers who import diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(b) or (c) or 80.520(a) into the United States by truck or by rail car may comply with the following requirements instead of the requirements to sample and test each batch of fuel designated as subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.581 otherwise applicable to importers:
                (a) Terminal testing. For purposes of determining compliance with the 15 ppm sulfur standard, the importer may use test results for sulfur content testing conducted by the foreign truck-loading or rail car-loading terminal operator for diesel fuel contained in the storage tank from which trucks or rail cars used to transport diesel fuel designated as subject to the 15 ppm sulfur content standard into the United States are loaded, provided the following conditions are met:
                (1) The sampling and testing shall be performed after each receipt of diesel fuel into the storage tank, or immediately before each transfer of diesel fuel to the importer's truck or rail car.
                (2) The sampling and testing shall be performed according to § 80.580.
                (3) At the time of each transfer of diesel fuel to the importer's truck or rail car for import to the U.S., the importer must obtain a copy of the terminal test result that indicates the sulfur content of the truck or rail car load, or truck or rail car compartment load, as applicable.
                (b) Quality assurance program. The importer must conduct a quality assurance program, as specified in this paragraph (b), for each truck or rail car loading terminal.
                (1) Quality assurance samples must be obtained from the truck-loading or rail car loading terminal and tested by the importer, or by an independent laboratory, and the terminal operator must not know in advance when samples are to be collected.
                (2) The sampling and testing must be performed using the methods specified in § 80.580.
                (3) The frequency of the quality assurance sampling and testing must be at least one sample for each 50 of an importer's trucks or rail cars that are loaded at a terminal, or one sample per month, whichever is more frequent.
                (c) Party required to conduct quality assurance testing. The quality assurance program under paragraph (b) of this section shall be conducted by the importer. In the alternative, this testing may be conducted by an independent laboratory that meets the criteria under § 80.65(f)(2)(iii), provided the importer receives copies of all results of tests conducted no later than 21 days after the sample was taken.
                (d) Alternative batch designations. For purposes of maintaining batch records under §§ 80.592, 80.600, and 80.602, designation of batches under § 80.598, and reporting under §§ 80.593, 80.601, and 80.604:
                (1) In lieu of treating each portion of a tank truck compartment delivered to a different facility as a different batch, a truck importer may treat each compartment as a batch, if all the fuel in the compartment is delivered only to retail outlets, wholesale purchaser-consumers or other end users. Where different compartments contain homogeneous product of identical designations, the total volume of those compartments may be treated as a single batch, if the entire volume is delivered only to retail outlets, wholesale purchaser-consumers or other ultimate consumers.
                (2) Each portion of a rail car (or rail cars) delivery of a different designation or each delivery to a different facility is considered to be a separate batch.
                (e) EPA inspections of terminals. EPA inspectors or auditors must be given full and immediate access to the truck or rail car-loading terminal and any laboratory at which samples of diesel fuel collected at the terminal are analyzed, and must be allowed to conduct inspections, review records, collect diesel fuel samples and perform audits. These inspections or audits may be either announced or unannounced.
                (f) Certified DFR-Diesel. This section does not apply to Certified DFR-Diesel as defined in § 80.620.
                (g) Effect of noncompliance. If any of the requirements of this section are not met, all motor vehicle diesel fuel and NRLM diesel fuel imported by the truck or rail car importer during the time the requirements are not met is deemed in violation of the 15 ppm sulfur diesel fuel standards in § 80.510(b) or (c) or § 80.520(a), as applicable. Additionally, if any requirement is not met, EPA may notify the importer of the violation, and, if the requirement is not fulfilled within 10 days of notification, the truck importer may not in the future use the sampling and testing provisions in this section in lieu of the provisions in § 80.581.

                § 80.584
                What are the precision and accuracy criteria for approval of test methods for determining the sulfur content of motor vehicle diesel fuel, NRLM diesel fuel, and ECA marine fuel?
                (a) Precision. (1) For motor vehicle diesel fuel and diesel fuel additives subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(a)(1) and NRLM diesel fuel and diesel fuel additives subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.510(b) and (c), a standard deviation less than 0.72 ppm, computed from the results of a minimum of 20 tests made over 20 days (tests may be arranged into no fewer than five batches of four or fewer tests each, with only one such batch allowed per day over the minimum of 20 days) on samples taken from a single homogeneous commercially available diesel fuel with a sulfur content in the range of 5-15 ppm. The 20 results must be a series of tests with a sequential record of the analyses and no omissions. A laboratory facility may exclude a given sample or test result only if the exclusion is for a valid reason under good laboratory practices and it maintains records regarding the sample and test results and the reason for excluding them.
                (2) For motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(c), and for NRLM diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.510(a), of a standard deviation less than 9.68 ppm, computed from the results of a minimum of 20 tests made over 20 days (tests may be arranged into no fewer than five batches of four or fewer tests each, with only one such batch allowed per day over the minimum of 20 days) on samples taken from a single homogeneous commercially available diesel fuel with a sulfur content in the range of 200-500 ppm. The 20 results must be a series of tests with a sequential record of the analyses and no omissions. A laboratory facility may exclude a given sample or test result only if the exclusion is for a valid reason under good laboratory practices and it maintains records regarding the sample and test results and the reason for excluding them.
                (3) For ECA marine fuel subject to the 1,000 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.510(k), of a standard deviation less than 18.07 ppm, computed from the results of a minimum of 20 tests made over 20 days (tests may be arranged into no fewer than five batches of four or fewer tests each, with only one such batch allowed per day over the minimum of 20 days) on samples taken from a single homogeneous commercially available diesel fuel with a sulfur content in the range of 700-1,000 ppm. The 20 results must be a series of tests with a sequential record of the analyses and no omissions. A laboratory facility may exclude a given sample or test result only if the exclusion is for a valid reason under good laboratory practices and it maintains records regarding the sample and test results and the reason for excluding them.
                (b) Accuracy. (1) For motor vehicle diesel fuel and diesel fuel additives subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(a)(1) and NRLM diesel fuel and diesel fuel additives subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.510(b) and (c):
                (i) The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available gravimetric sulfur standard in the range of 1-10 ppm sulfur shall not differ from the accepted reference value (ARV) of that standard by more than 0.54 ppm sulfur;
                (ii) The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available gravimetric sulfur standard in the range of 10-20 ppm sulfur shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by more than 0.54 ppm sulfur; and
                (iii) In applying the tests of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, individual test results shall be compensated for any known chemical interferences.
                (2) For motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.520(c), and for NRLM diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.510(a):

                (i) The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available gravimetric sulfur standard in the range of 100-200 ppm sulfur shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by more than 7.26 ppm sulfur;
                (ii) The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed on a commercially available gravimetric sulfur standard in the range of 400-500 ppm sulfur shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by more than 7.26 ppm sulfur; and
                (iii) In applying the tests of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, individual test results shall be compensated for any known chemical interferences.
                (3) For ECA marine fuel subject to the 1,000 ppm sulfur standard of § 80.510(k):

                § 80.585
                What is the process for approval of a test method for determining the sulfur content of diesel or ECA marine fuel?
                (a)(1) Approval of test methods approved by voluntary consensus-based standards bodies. Through December 31, 2015, for such a method to be approved, the following information must be submitted to the Administrator by each test facility for each test method that it wishes to have approved: Any test method approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body, such as ASTM International or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), shall be approved as a test method for determining the sulfur content of diesel fuel if it meets the applicable accuracy and precision criteria under § 80.584. The approval of a test method is limited to the single test facility that performed the testing for accuracy and precision. The individual facility must submit the accuracy and precision results for each method, including information on the date and time of each test measurement used to demonstrate precision, following procedures established by the Administrator.
                (2) Approval of test methods approved by voluntary consensus-based standards bodies. Beginning January 1, 2016, any test method approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body, such as the ASTM International or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), shall be approved as a test method for determining the sulfur content of diesel fuel if it meets the applicable accuracy and precision criteria under § 80.584. These records must be kept by the facility for a period of five years.
                (b) Approval of test methods not approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body. For such a method to be approved, the following information must be submitted to the Administrator by each test facility for each test method that it wishes to have approved:
                (1) Full test method documentation, including a description of the technology and/or instrumentation that makes the method functional.
                (2) Information demonstrating that the test method meets the applicable accuracy and precision criteria of § 80.584, including information on the date and time of each test measurement used to demonstrate precision.
                (3) If requested by the Administrator, test results from use of the method to analyze samples of commercially available fuel provided by EPA.
                (4) Any additional information requested by the Administrator and necessary to render a decision as to approval of the test method.
                (c) Sample retention. Samples used for precision and accuracy determination must be retained for 90 days.
                (d) EPA approval. (1) Within 90 days of receipt of all materials required to be submitted under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Administrator shall determine whether the test method is approved under this section.
                (2) If the Administrator denies approval of the test method, within 90 days of receipt of all materials required to be submitted under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Administrator will notify the applicant of the reasons for not approving the method. If the Administrator does not notify the applicant within 90 days of receipt of the application, that the test method is not approved, then the test method shall be deemed approved.

                (3) If the Administrator finds that an individual test facility has provided false or inaccurate information under this section, upon notice from the Administrator the approval shall be void ab initio.
                
                (4) The approval of any test method under paragraph (b) of this section shall be valid for five years from the date of approval by the Administrator. After the five year period has ceased, in order for the test method approval to remain valid, the test method must be resubmitted for approval with applicable precision and accuracy information contained in § 80.584(a) and (b). If, however, the test method is later approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body, the approval shall remain valid as long as the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section are met.
                (e) Quality assurance procedures for sulfur measurement instrumentation. A test shall not be considered a test using an approved test method unless the following quality control procedures are performed separately for each instrument used to make measurements:
                (1) Follow all mandatory provisions of ASTM D6299 and construct control charts from the mandatory quality control testing prescribed in paragraph 7.1 of the reference method, following guidelines under A 1.5.1 for individual observation charts and A 1.5.4 for moving range charts.
                (2) Follow paragraph 7.3.1 of ASTM D6299 to check standards using a reference material at least monthly or following any major change to the laboratory equipment or test procedure. Any deviation from the accepted reference value of a check standard greater than 1.44 ppm (for diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard), 19.36 ppm (for diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard), or 36.14 ppm (for ECA marine fuel subject to the 1,000 ppm sulfur standard must be investigated.
                (3) Samples of tested batches must be retained for 30 days or the period equal to the interval between quality control sample tests, whichever is longer.
                (4) Upon discovery of any quality control testing violation of paragraph A 1.5.1.3 for individual observation charts or A1.5.4.1 and A1.5.4.2 for moving range charts of ASTM D6299, or any check standard deviation greater than 1.44 ppm (for diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard), 19.36 ppm (for diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard), or 36.14 ppm (for ECA marine fuel subject to the 1,000 ppm sulfur standard), conduct an investigation into the cause of such violation or deviation and, after restoring method performance to statistical control, retest retained samples from batches originally tested since the last satisfactory quality control material or check standard testing occasion.

                (b) Volume balance for motor vehicle diesel fuel. (1) A facility's motor vehicle diesel fuel volume balance is calculated as follows:
                
                MVB = MVI−MVO−MVINVCHG
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  MVB = the volume balance for motor vehicle diesel fuel for the compliance period.

                  ΣMVB = the sum of the balances for motor vehicle diesel fuel for the current compliance period and previous compliance periods.
                
                

                (5) The volume balance required for purposes of compliance with § 80.598(b)(9)(vii)(B) means:

                § 80.613
                What defenses apply to persons deemed liable for a violation of a prohibited act under this subpart?
                (a) Presumptive liability defenses. (1) Any person deemed liable for a violation of a prohibition under § 80.612(a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(iii), (a)(2), or (a)(3), will not be deemed in violation if the person demonstrates all of the following, as applicable:
                (i) The violation was not caused by the person or the person's employee or agent;
                (ii) Product transfer documents account for fuel or additive found to be in violation and indicate that the violating product was in compliance with the applicable requirements when it was under the person's control;
                (iii) The person conducted a quality assurance sampling and testing program, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, except for those persons subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iv), (a)(1)(v), or (a)(1)(vi) of this section or § 80.614. A carrier may rely on the quality assurance program carried out by another party, including the party who owns the diesel fuel in question, provided that the quality assurance program is carried out properly. Retailers, wholesale purchaser-consumers, and ultimate consumers of diesel fuel are not required to conduct quality assurance programs;
                (iv) For refiners and importers of diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(b) or (c) or § 80.520(a)(1), the 500 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(a) or § 80.520(c), and/or the 1,000 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.510(k), test results that—
                (A) Were conducted according to an appropriate test methodology approved or designated under §§ 80.580 through 80.586, 80.2(w), or 80.2(z), as appropriate; and
                (B) Establish that, when it left the party's control, the fuel did not violate the sulfur, cetane or aromatics standard, or the dye or marking provisions of §§ 80.510 or 80.511, as applicable;
                (v) For any truck loading terminal or any other person who delivers heating oil for delivery to the ultimate consumer and is subject to the requirement to mark heating oil or LM diesel fuel under § 80.510(d) through (f), data which demonstrates that when it left the truck loading terminal or other facility, the concentration of marker solvent yellow 124 was equal to or greater than six milligrams per liter. In lieu of testing for marker solvent yellow 124 concentration, evidence may be presented of an oversight program, including records of marker inventory, purchase and additization, and records of periodic inspection and calibration of additization equipment that ensures that marker is added to heating oil or LM diesel fuel, as applicable, under § 80.510(d) through (f) in the required concentration;

                (vi) Except as provided in § 80.614, for any person who, at a downstream location, blends a diesel fuel additive subject to the requirements of § 80.521(b) into motor vehicle diesel fuel or NRLM diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a) or § 80.510(b) or (c), except a person who blends additives into fuel tanker trucks at a truck loading rack subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, test results which are conducted subsequent to the blending of the additive into the fuel, and which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section; and
                (vii) Any person deemed liable for a designation or volume balance provisions violation under § 80.610(b) and 80.612(a) will not be deemed in violation if the person demonstrates, through product transfer documents, records, reports and other evidence that the diesel fuel or distillate was properly designated and volume balance requirements were met.
                (2) Any person deemed liable for a violation under § 80.612(a)(1)(iv), in regard to a diesel fuel additive subject to the requirements of § 80.521(a), will not be deemed in violation if the person demonstrates that—
                (i) Product transfer document(s) account for the additive in the fuel found to be in violation, which comply with the requirements under § 80.591(a), and indicate that the additive was in compliance with the applicable requirements while it was under the party's control; and
                (ii) For the additive's manufacturer or importer, test results which accurately establish that, when it left the party's control, the additive in the diesel fuel determined to be in violation did not have a sulfur content greater than or equal to 15 ppm.
                (A) Analysis of the additive sulfur content pursuant to this paragraph (a)(2) may be conducted at the time the batch was manufactured or imported, or on a sample of that batch which the manufacturer or importer retains for such purpose for a minimum of two years from the date the batch was manufactured or imported.
                (B) After two years from the date the additive batch was manufactured or imported, the additive manufacturer or importer is no longer required to retain samples for the purpose of complying with the testing requirements of this paragraph (a)(2).
                (C) The analysis of the sulfur content of the additive must be conducted pursuant to the requirements of § 80.580.
                (3) Any person who is deemed liable for a violation under § 80.612(a)(1)(iv) with regard to a diesel fuel additive subject to the requirements of § 80.521(b), will not be deemed in violation if the person demonstrates that—
                (i) The violation was not caused by the party or the party's employee or agent;
                (ii) Product transfer document(s) which comply with the additive information requirements under § 80.591(b), account for the additive in the fuel found to be in violation, and indicate that the additive was in compliance with the applicable requirements while it was under the party's control; and
                (iii) For the additive's manufacturer or importer, test results which accurately establish that, when it left the party's control, the additive in the diesel fuel determined to be in violation was in conformity with the information on the additive product transfer document pursuant to the requirements of § 80.591(b). The testing procedures applicable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, also apply under this paragraph (a)(3).
                (b) Branded refiner defenses. In the case of a violation found at a facility operating under the corporate, trade or brand name of a refiner or importer, or a refiner's or importer's marketing subsidiary, the refiner or importer must show, in addition to the defense elements required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that the violation was caused by:
                (1) An act in violation of law (other than the Clean Air Act or this Part 80), or an act of sabotage or vandalism;
                (2) The action of any refiner, importer, retailer, distributor, reseller, oxygenate blender, carrier, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer in violation of a contractual agreement between the branded refiner or importer and the person designed to prevent such action, and despite periodic sampling and testing by the branded refiner or importer to ensure compliance with such contractual obligation; or

                (3) The action of any carrier or other distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner or importer, but engaged for transportation of diesel fuel, despite specifications or inspections of procedures and equipment which are reasonably calculated to prevent such action.
                (c) Causation demonstration. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any person to show that a violation was not caused by that person, or under paragraph (b) of this section to show that a violation was caused by any of the specified actions, the person must demonstrate by reasonably specific showing, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the violation was caused or must have been caused by another person and that the person asserting the defense did not contribute to that other person's causation.
                (d) Quality assurance and testing program. To demonstrate an acceptable quality assurance program under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, a person must present evidence of the following:
                (1) A periodic sampling and testing program to ensure the diesel fuel or additive the person sold, dispensed, supplied, stored, or transported, meets the applicable standards and requirements, including the requirements relating to the presence of marker solvent yellow 124.
                (2) For those parties who, at a downstream location, blend diesel fuel additives subject to the requirements of § 80.521(b) into fuel trucks at a truck loading rack, the periodic sampling and testing program required under this paragraph (d) must ensure, by taking into account the greater risk of noncompliance created through use of a high sulfur additive, that the diesel fuel into which the additive was blended meets the applicable standards subsequent to the blending.
                (3) On each occasion when diesel fuel or additive is found not in compliance with the applicable standard:
                (i) The person immediately ceases selling, offering for sale, dispensing, supplying, offering for supply, storing or transporting the non-complying product.
                (ii) The person promptly remedies the violation and the factors that caused the violation (for example, by removing the non-complying product from the distribution system until the applicable standard is achieved and taking steps to prevent future violations of a similar nature from occurring).
                (4) For any carrier who transports diesel fuel or additive in a tank truck, the quality assurance program required under this paragraph (d) need not include its own periodic sampling and testing of the diesel fuel or additive in the tank truck, but in lieu of such tank truck sampling and testing, the carrier shall demonstrate evidence of an oversight program for monitoring compliance with the requirements of this subpart relating to the transport or storage of such product by tank truck, such as appropriate guidance to drivers regarding compliance with the applicable sulfur standard, product segregation and product transfer document requirements, and the periodic review of records received in the ordinary course of business concerning diesel fuel or additive quality and delivery.
                (e) Alternative defense requirements. A person deemed liable under § 80.612(a) for a violation of § 80.610(a)(1), concerning diesel fuel that is sold, offered for sale, or dispensed at a retail outlet and that does not meet the applicable sulfur content standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d), may comply with the following alternative defense requirements in lieu of the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section to the extent provided for, and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this paragraph (e):
                (1) Independent survey association. To comply with the alternative defense requirements under this paragraph (e), a person must participate in the funding of a consortium which arranges to have an independent survey association conduct a statistically valid program of annual compliance surveys pursuant to a survey plan which has been approved by EPA, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(4) of this section.
                (2) General requirements. The consortium survey program under this paragraph (e) must be:

                (iv) Provide notice of samples with sulfur content greater than the 15 ppm standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d), as follows:
                (A) In the case of any test result that is one or two ppm greater than the 15 ppm standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d), the independent survey association shall, within twenty-four hours after the laboratory receives the sample, send notification of the test result as follows: In the case of a sample collected at a retail outlet at which the brand name of a refiner or importer is displayed, to the refiner or importer, and EPA; and in the case of a sample collected at other retail outlets, to the retailer and EPA. This initial notification to a refiner shall include specific information concerning the name and address of the retail outlet, contact information, the brand, and the sulfur content of the sample.
                (B) In the case of any test result that is three or more ppm greater than the 15 ppm standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d), or for a test result that is one or two ppm greater than the 15 ppm standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d), and the retail outlet has had an exceedance within the previous two years, the independent survey association shall, within the time limits specified in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, provide notice to the parties described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section. The notice to EPA must include the name and address of the retail outlet, and the telephone number, if known.

                (C) The independent survey association shall provide notice to the identified contact person or persons for each party specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section in writing (e.g. e-mail or facsimile) and, if requested by the identified contact person, by telephone.
                
                (v) Provide to EPA quarterly and annual summary survey reports which include the information specified in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.
                (vi) Maintain all records relating to the surveys conducted under this paragraph (e) for a period of at least 5 years.
                (vii) At any time permit any representative of EPA to monitor the conduct of the surveys, including sample collection, transportation, storage, and analysis.
                (4) Survey plan design requirements. The proposed survey plan required under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section shall, at a minimum, include the following:
                (i) Number of surveys. The survey plan shall include four surveys each calendar year. The four surveys collectively are called the survey series.
                (ii) Sampling areas. The survey plan shall include sampling in three types of areas, called sampling strata, during each survey: Densely populated areas, transportation corridors and rural areas. These sampling strata shall be further divided into discrete sampling areas, or clusters. Each survey shall include sampling in at least 40 sampling areas in each stratum, randomly selected.
                (iii) No advance notice of surveys. The survey plan shall include procedures to keep confidential from any regulated party, but not from EPA, the identification of the sampling areas that are included in any survey plan prior to the beginning of a survey in an area.
                (iv) Retail outlet selection.
                
                (A) The retail outlets to be sampled in a sampling area shall be selected from among all retail outlets in the sampling area that sell motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1), with probability of selection proportionate to the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1) sold at the retail outlets, and inclusion of retail outlets with different brand names and unbranded, if possible.
                (B) In the case of any retail outlet from which a sample of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1) was collected during a survey and determined to have a sulfur content that exceeds the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d), that retail outlet shall be included in the subsequent survey.
                (C) Only a single sample shall be collected at each retail outlet, except that where a retail outlet had a sample from the preceding survey with a test result that exceeds the 15 ppm standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d), separate samples shall be taken that represent the diesel fuel contained in each storage tank containing motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1), unless collection of separate samples is not practicable (for example, due to diesel piping arrangements or pump outages).
                (v) Number of samples. (A) The minimum number of samples to be included in the survey plan for each calendar year shall be calculated as follows:
                
                  ER11MY10.288
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  
                    n = minimum number of samples in a year-long survey series. However, in no case shall n be larger than 9,600 or smaller than 1,800.
                  Zα = upper percentile point from the normal distribution to achieve a one-tailed 95% confidence level (5% α-level). Thus, Zα equals 1.645.
                  Zβ = upper percentile point to achieve 95% power. Thus, Zβ equals 1.645.
                  φl = the maximum proportion of stations selling non-compliant fuel for the fuel in a region to be deemed compliant. In this test, the parameter needs to be 5% or greater, i.e., 5% or more of the stations, within a stratum such that the region is considered non-compliant. For this survey, φl will be 5%.
                  
                  φo = the underlying proportion of non-compliant stations in a sample. For calendar year 2011, φowill be 1.9%. For calendar years 2012 and beyond, φo will be the average of the proportion of stations to be non-compliant over the previous four surveys.
                  Stn = number of sampling strata. For purposes of this survey program, Stn equals 3.
                  Fa = adjustment factor for the number of extra samples required to compensate for collected samples that cannot be included in the survey, based on the number of additional samples required during the previous four surveys. However, in no case shall the value of Fa be smaller than 1.1. For purposes of this adjustment factor, a sample shall be treated as one that can be included in the survey only if the fuel was offered for sale as motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1) at the retail outlet where the sample was collected and if an appropriate laboratory analysis of this fuel is conducted.
                  Fb = adjustment factor for the number of samples required to resample each retail outlet with test results greater than 17 ppm (resampling), based on the rate of resampling required during the previous four surveys. However, in no case shall the value of Fb be smaller than 1.1.
                  Sun = number of surveys per year. For purposes of this survey program, Sun equals 4.
                
                
                (B) The number of samples obtained from the formula in paragraph (e)(4)(v)(A) of this section, after being incremented as necessary to allocate whole numbers of samples to each cluster, shall be distributed approximately equally for the surveys conducted during the calendar year. Within a survey, the samples shall be divided approximately equally for the three strata.
                (5) Sulfur test result that is one or two ppm Greater than the 15 ppm standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d). The following provisions apply if the tested sulfur level of a diesel fuel sample collected by the independent survey association is one or two ppm greater than the 15 ppm standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d).
                (i) Branded refiner or importer. Where the sample was collected at a retail outlet at which the brand name of a refiner or importer is displayed, the branded refiner or importer will be deemed to have established its defense under this section, provided that the refiner or importer participates in a consortium as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and provided that the refiner or importer also demonstrates the following:
                (A) The sulfur content of the diesel fuel at the terminal(s) that most recently supplied the retail outlet was no greater than 15 ppm prior to adjustment under § 80.580(d) when dispensed for delivery to the retail outlet;
                (B) Best efforts and accepted business practices are used by parties downstream from the refiner or importer to avoid diesel fuel contamination. These would include, for example, procedures for ensuring motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1) is not contaminated in delivery trucks, and procedures for ensuring delivery truck drivers can identify retail outlet drop points for motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1).
                (C) Upon receiving the notification required under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, any pumps supplied by the retail storage tank where the noncompliant diesel fuel was found were shutdown until such time that the fuel at issue was retested and the sulfur content of the fuel was found to be no greater than the 15 ppm standard under § 80.520(a)(1), as adjusted under § 80.580(d). Prior to May 31, 2010, as an alternative to shutting down pumps supplied by the retail storage tank where the noncompliant diesel fuel was found, such pumps may be relabeled with the language required under § 80.571(b). The steps required in this paragraph (e)(5)(i)(C) must be taken as soon as practicable after receiving the notification required under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, which normally will be within the same business day, but no longer than twenty-four hours after notification is received unless the refiner or importer demonstrates this timing is not possible.
                (D) A root cause analysis is performed to determine the cause of the noncompliant diesel fuel and appropriate actions are taken to prevent future violations.

                (E) The independent survey association samples and retests the diesel fuel at the retail outlet during its next survey, in addition to the scheduled sampling and testing under the approved survey program.
                (F) The refiner or importer submits a report to EPA no later than 120 days following the date the sample was collected at the retail outlet, which includes the information specified in paragraph (e)(7) of this section.
                (G) The refiner or importer supplies EPA with copies of the contracts with downstream parties specified in § 80.613(b)(2) or the specifications or inspections of procedures and equipment described in § 80.613(b)(3), as appropriate, which are designed to prevent the contamination of motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standard under § 80.520(a)(1).

                [66 FR 5136, Jan. 18, 2001, as amended at 69 FR 39204, June 29, 2004; 70 FR 40899, July 15, 2005; 75 FR 22977, Apr. 30, 2010; 75 FR 26127, May 11, 2010; 79 FR 42159, July 18, 2014]
              
              
                § 80.614
                What are the alternative defense requirements in lieu of § 80.613(a)(1)(vi)?
                Any person who blends a MVNRLM diesel fuel additive package into MVNRLM diesel fuel subject to the 15 ppm sulfur standards of § 80.510(b) or (c) or § 80.520(a) which contains a static dissipater additive that has a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm but whose contribution to the sulfur content of the MVNRLM diesel fuel is less than 0.4 ppm at its maximum recommended concentration, and/or red dye that has a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm but whose contribution to the sulfur content of the MVNRLM diesel fuel is less than 0.04 ppm at its maximum recommended concentration, and which contains no other additives with a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm must establish all the following in order to use this section as an alternative to the defense element under § 80.613(a)(1)(vi):
                (a)(1) The blender of the additive package has a sulfur content test result for the MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to blending of the additive package that indicates that the additive package, when added, will not cause the MVNRLM diesel fuel sulfur content to exceed 15 ppm sulfur.
                (2) In cases where the storage tank that contains MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to additization contains multiple fuel batches, the blender of the additive package must have sulfur test results on each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel that was added to the storage tank during the current and previous volumetric accounting reconciliation (VAR) periods, which indicates that the additive package, when added to the component MVNRLM diesel fuel batch in the storage tank with the highest sulfur level would not cause that component batch to exceed 15 ppm sulfur.
                (b) The VAR standard is attained as determined under the provisions of this section. The VAR reconciliation standard is attained when the actual concentration of the additive package used per the VAR formula record under paragraph (f) of this section is less than the concentration that would have caused any batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to exceed a sulfur content of 15 ppm given the maximum sulfur test result on any MVNRLM diesel fuel batch described in paragraph (a) of this section that is additized with the additive package during the VAR period.
                (c) The product transfer document complies with the applicable sulfur information requirements of § 80.591.
                (d) If more than one additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye is used during a VAR period, then a separate VAR formula record must be created for MVNRLM diesel fuel additized for each of the additive packages used. In such cases, the amount of the each additive package used must be accurately and separately measured, either through the use of a separate storage tank, a separate meter, or some other measurement system that is able to accurately distinguish its use.

                (e) Recorded volumes of MVNRLM diesel fuel and the additive package must be expressed to the nearest gallon (or smaller units), except that additive package volumes of five gallons or less must be expressed to the nearest tenth of a gallon (or smaller units). However, if the blender's equipment cannot accurately measure to the nearest tenth of a gallon, then such volumes must be rounded upward to the next higher gallon for purposes of determining compliance with this section.
                
                (f) Each VAR formula record must also contain the following information:
                (1) Automated blending facilities. In the case of an automated additive package blending facility, for each VAR period, for each storage system for an additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye, and each additive package in that storage system, the following must be recorded:
                (i)(A) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the package being reconciled, the maximum recommended treatment level, the potential contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that might result when the additive package is used at its maximum recommended treatment level, the intended treatment level, and the contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that would result when the additive package is used at its intended treatment level. The intended treatment level is the treatment level that the additive injection equipment is set to.
                (B) The maximum recommended treatment level and the intended treatment level must be expressed in terms of gallons of the additive package per thousand gallons of MVNRLM diesel fuel, and expressed to four significant figures. If the additive package storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.
                (ii) The total volume of the additive package blended into MVNRLM diesel fuel, in accordance with one of the following methods, as applicable.
                (A) For a facility which uses in-line meters to measure usage, the total volume of additive package measured, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter readings for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.

                (B) For a facility which uses a gauge to measure the inventory of the additive package storage tank, the total volume of additive package shall be calculated from the following equation:
                
                Additive package volume = (A) − (B) + (C) − (D)
                
                
                  Where:
                  
                  A = Initial additive package inventory of the tank
                  B = Final additive package inventory of the tank
                  C = Sum of any additions to additive package inventory
                  D = Sum of any withdrawals from additive package inventory for purposes other than the additization of MVNRLM diesel fuel.
                
                
                (C) The value of each variable in the equation in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section must be separately recorded on the VAR formula record. In addition, a list of each additive package addition included in variable C and a list of each additive package withdrawal included in variable D must be provided, either on the formula record or as VAR supporting documentation.
                (iii) The total volume of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package has been added, together with supporting data which includes one of the following: the beginning and ending meter measurements for each meter being measured, the metered batch volume measurements for each meter being measured, or other comparable metered measurements. The supporting data may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation.
                (iv) The actual concentration of the additive package, calculated as the total volume of the additive package added (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section), divided by the total volume of MVNRLM diesel fuel (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to 4 significant figures.

                (v) A list of each additive package concentration rate set for the additive package that is the subject of the VAR record, together with the date and description of each adjustment to any initially set concentration. The concentration adjustment information may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in the form of computer printouts or other comparable VAR supporting documentation. No concentration setting is permitted above the maximum recommended concentration supplied by the additive manufacturer, except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section.
                (vi) The dates of the VAR period, which shall be no longer than thirty-one days. If the VAR period is contemporaneous with a calendar month, then specifying the month will fulfill this requirement; if not, then the beginning and ending dates and times of the VAR period must be listed. The times may be supplied on the VAR formula record or in supporting documentation. Any adjustment to any additive package concentration rate initially set in the VAR period shall terminate that VAR period and initiate a new VAR period, except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(vii) of this section.
                (vii) The concentration setting for the additive package injector may be changed from the concentration initially set in the VAR period without terminating that VAR period, provided that:
                (A) The purpose of the change is to correct a batch under-additization prior to the end of the VAR period and prior to the transfer of the batch to another party, or to correct an equipment malfunction where there has been no over-additization of the additive;
                (B) The concentration is immediately returned after the correction to a concentration that fulfills the requirements of this paragraph (f);
                (C) The blender creates and maintains documentation establishing the date and adjustments of the correction; and
                (D) If the correction is initiated only to rectify an equipment malfunction, and the amount of additive package used in this procedure is not added to MVNRLM diesel fuel within the compliance period, then this amount is subtracted from the additive package volume listed on the VAR formula record. In such a case, the addition of this amount of additive must be reflected in the following VAR period.
                (viii) The measured sulfur level for each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package is added during each VAR period. In cases where the storage tank that contains MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to additization contains multiple fuel batches, a measured sulfur level on each batch added to the storage tank during the current and previous VAR periods must be recorded.
                (2) Non-automated facilities. In the case of a facility in which hand blending or any other non-automated method is used to blend the additive packages, for each additive package and for each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package is being added, the following shall be recorded:
                (i) The manufacturer and commercial identifying name of the additive package being reconciled, the maximum recommended treatment level, the potential contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that might result when the additive package is used at its maximum recommended treatment level, the intended treatment level, and the contribution to the sulfur content of the finished fuel that would result when the additive package is used at its intended treatment level.
                (A) The maximum recommended treatment level and the intended treatment level must be expressed in terms of gallons of additive package per thousand gallons of MVNRLM diesel fuel, and expressed to four significant figures.
                (B) If the additive package storage system which is the subject of the VAR formula record is a proprietary system under the control of a customer, this fact must be indicated on the record.
                (ii) The date of the additization that is the subject of the VAR formula record.
                (iii) The volume of added additive package.
                (iv) The volume of the MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package has been added.
                (v) The brand (if known) of MVNRLM diesel fuel.

                (vi) The actual additive package concentration, calculated as the volume of added additive package (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section), divided by the volume of MVNRLM diesel fuel (pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section). The concentration must be calculated and recorded to four significant figures.
                
                (vii) The measured sulfur level for each batch of MVNRLM diesel fuel to which the additive package is added during each VAR period. In cases where the storage tanks that contains MVNRLM diesel fuel prior to additization contains multiple fuel batches, a measured sulfur level on each batch added to the storage tank during the current and previous VAR periods must be recorded.
                (3) VAR formula records. Every VAR formula record created pursuant to paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section shall contain the following:
                (i) The signature of the creator of the VAR record;
                (ii) The date of the creation of the VAR record; and
                (iii) A certification of correctness by the creator of the VAR record.
                (4) Electronically-generated VAR formula and supporting records. (i) Electronically-generated records are acceptable for VAR formula records and supporting documentation (including PTDs), provided that they are complete, accessible, and easily readable. VAR formula records must also be stored with access and audit security, which must restrict to a limited number of specified people those who have the ability to alter or delete the records. In addition, parties maintaining records electronically must make available to EPA the hardware and software necessary to review the records.
                (ii) Electronically-generated VAR formula records may use an electronic user identification code to satisfy the signature requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, provided that:
                (A) The use of the identification is limited to the record creator; and
                (B) A paper record is maintained, which is signed and dated by the VAR formula record creator, acknowledging that the use of that particular user ID on a VAR formula record is equivalent to his/her signature on the document.
                (5) Calibration requirements for automated blending facilities. Automated static dissipater additive package blenders must calibrate their additive package equipment at least once in each calendar half year, with the acceptable calibrations being no less than one hundred twenty days apart, except that calibrations may be closer in time so long as at least two calibrations meet the requirements to be in separate halves of the calendar year and no less than 120 days apart. Equipment recalibration is also required each time the static dissipater additive package is changed, unless written documentation indicates that the new additive package has the same viscosity as the previous additive package. Additive package change calibrations may be used to satisfy the semiannual requirement provided that the calibrations occur in the appropriate half calendar year and are no less than one hundred twenty days apart.
                (6) Additional VAR documentation. The following VAR supporting documentation must also be created and maintained:
                (i) For all automated additive package blending facilities, documentation reflecting performance of the calibrations required by paragraph (f)(5) of this section, and any associated adjustments of the automated additive package injection equipment;
                (ii) For all blending facilities that blend an additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye, product transfer documents for all such additive packages, and MVNRLM diesel fuel transferred into or out of the facility that is additized with an additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye;
                (iii) For all automated additive package blending facilities that use an additive package containing a static dissipater additive and/or red dye, documentation establishing the brands (if known) of the MVNRLM diesel fuel which is the subject of the VAR formula record; and
                (iv) For all hand blenders of an additive package that contains a static dissipater additive and/or red dye, the documentation, if in the party's possession, supporting the volumes of MVNRLM diesel fuel and additive package reported on the VAR formula record.
                (7) Document retention and availability. All blenders of an additive package that contains a static dissipater additive and/or red dye shall retain the documents required under this section for a period of five years from the date the VAR formula records and supporting documentation are created, and shall deliver them upon request to the EPA Administrator or the Administrator's authorized representative.
                (i) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section, automated additive package blender facilities and hand-blender facilities which are terminals, which physically blend an additive packages that contains a static dissipater additive and/or red dye into MVNRLM diesel fuel, must make immediately available to EPA, upon request, the preceding twelve months of VAR formula records plus the preceding two months of VAR supporting documentation.
                (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(7)(iii) of this section, other hand-blending additive package facilities which physically blend additive package that contains a static dissipater additive and/or red dye into MVNRLM diesel fuel must make immediately available to EPA, upon request, the preceding two months of VAR formula records and VAR supporting documentation.
                (iii) Facilities which have centrally maintained records at other locations, or have customers who maintain their own records at other locations for their proprietary additive package injection systems, and which can document this fact to the Agency, may have until the start of the next business day after the EPA request to supply VAR supporting documentation, or longer if approved by the Agency.
                (iv) In this paragraph (f)(7), the term “immediately available” means that the records must be provided, electronically or otherwise, within approximately one hour of EPA's request, or within a longer time frame as approved by EPA.

              Provisions for Foreign Refiners and Importers for Motor Vehicle Diesel Fuel Subject to a Temporary Compliance Option or Hardship Provision
              
                § 80.620
                What are the additional requirements for diesel fuel or distillates produced by foreign refineries subject to a temporary refiner compliance option, hardship provisions, or motor vehicle or NRLM diesel fuel credit provisions?
                (a) Definitions. (1) A foreign refinery is a refinery that is located outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively referred to in this section as “the United States”).
                (2) A foreign refiner is a person who meets the definition of refiner under § 80.2(i) for a foreign refinery.
                (3) A diesel fuel program foreign refiner (“DFR”) is a foreign refiner that has been approved by EPA for participation in any motor vehicle diesel fuel or NRLM diesel fuel provision of § 80.530 through 80.533, or §§ 80.535, 80.536, 80.540, 80.552, 80.553, 80.554, 80.560 or 80.561 (collectively referred to as “diesel foreign refiner program”).
                (4) “DFR-Diesel” means diesel fuel or distillate fuel as applicable under subpart I of this part produced at a DFR refinery that is imported into the United States.
                (5) “Non-DFR-Diesel” means diesel fuel or distillate fuel that is produced at a foreign refinery that has not been approved as a DFR foreign refiner, diesel fuel produced at a DFR foreign refinery that is not imported into the United States, and diesel fuel produced at a DFR foreign refinery during a period when the foreign refiner has opted to not participate in the DFR-Diesel foreign refiner program under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

                (6) “Certified DFR-Diesel” means DFR-Diesel the foreign refiner intends to include in the foreign refinery's compliance calculations under any provisions of § 80.530 through 80.533, or §§ 80.535, 80.536, 80.540, 80.552, 80.553, 80.554, 80.560 or 80.561 and does include in these compliance calculations when reported to EPA.
                (7) “Non-Certified DFR-Diesel” means DFR-Diesel fuel that a DFR foreign refiner imports to the United States that is not Certified DFR-Diesel.
                (b) Baseline. For any foreign refiner to obtain approval under the diesel foreign refiner program of this subpart for any refinery, it must apply for approval under the applicable provisions of this subpart. To obtain approval the refiner is required, as applicable, to demonstrate a volume baseline under subpart I of this part.
                (1) The refiner shall follow the procedures, applicable to volume baselines and using diesel fuel, or if applicable, heating oil, instead of gasoline, in §§ 80.91 through 80.93 to establish the volume of motor vehicle diesel fuel that was produced at the refinery and imported into the United States during the applicable years for purposes of establishing a baseline under Subpart I for applicable fuels produced for use in the United States.
                (2) In making determinations for foreign refinery baselines EPA will consider all information supplied by a foreign refiner, and in addition may rely on any and all appropriate assumptions necessary to make such determinations.
                (3) Where a foreign refiner submits a petition that is incomplete or inadequate to establish an accurate baseline, and the refiner fails to correct this deficiency after a request for more information, EPA will not assign an individual refinery baseline.
                (c) General requirements for DFR foreign refiners. A foreign refiner of a refinery that is approved under the diesel foreign refiner program of this subpart must designate each batch of diesel fuel produced at the foreign refinery that is exported to the United States as either Certified DFR-Diesel or as Non-Certified DFR-Diesel, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. It must further designate all Certified DFR-Diesel as provided in § 80.598, and designate whether the diesel fuel is dyed or undyed, and for heating oil and/or locomotive or marine diesel fuel whether it is marked or unmarked under § 80.510(d) through (f). It must further designate any credits earned as either nonroad diesel credits or motor vehicle diesel credits.
                (1) In the case of Certified DFR-Diesel, the foreign refiner must meet all requirements that apply to refiners under this subpart, except that:
                (i) For purposes of complying with the compliance option requirements of § 80.530, motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by a foreign refinery must comply separately for each Credit Trading Area of import, as defined in § 80.531(a)(5).
                (ii) For purposes of complying with the compliance option requirements of § 80.530, credits obtained from any other refinery or from any importer must have been generated in the same Credit Trading Area as the Credit Trading Area of import of the fuel for which credits are needed to achieve compliance.
                (iii) For purposes of generating credits under § 80.531, credits shall be generated separately by Credit Trading Area of import and shall be designated by Credit Trading Area of importation and by port of importation.
                (2) In the case of Non-Certified DFR-Diesel, the foreign refiner shall meet all the following requirements:
                (i) The designation requirements in this section.
                (ii) The reporting requirements in this section and in §§ 80.593, 80.594, 80.601, and 80.604.

                (iv) The prohibitions in this section and in § 80.610.
                (3)(i) Any foreign refiner that has been approved to produce diesel fuel subject to the diesel foreign refiner program for a foreign refinery under this subpart may elect to classify no diesel fuel imported into the United States as DFR-Diesel provided the foreign refiner notifies EPA of the election no later than 60 calendar days prior to the beginning of the compliance period.

                (ii) An election under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section shall be for a 12 month compliance period and apply to all diesel fuel that is produced by the foreign refinery that is imported into the United States, and shall remain in effect for each succeeding year unless and until the foreign refiner notifies EPA of the termination of the election. The change in election shall take effect at the beginning of the next annual compliance period.
                (d) Designation, product transfer documents, and foreign refiner certification. (1) Any foreign refiner of a foreign refinery that has been approved by EPA to produce motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the diesel foreign refiner program must designate each batch of DFR-Diesel as such at the time the diesel fuel is produced, unless the refiner has elected to classify no diesel fuel exported to the United States as DFR-Diesel under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
                (2) On each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any DFR-Diesel prior to its being imported into the United States, it must include the following information as part of the product transfer document information in this section:
                (i) Designation of the diesel fuel or distillate as Certified DFR-Diesel or as Non-Certified DFR-Diesel, and if it is Certified DFR-Diesel, further designate the fuel pursuant to § 80.598, and whether the diesel fuel or distillate is dyed or undyed, and for heating oil whether it is marked or unmarked under § 80.510(d) through (f), and all other applicable product transfer document information required under § 80.590; and
                (ii) The name and EPA refinery registration number (under § 80.597) of the refinery where the DFR-Diesel was produced.
                (3) On each occasion when DFR-Diesel is loaded onto a vessel or other transportation mode for transport to the United States, the foreign refiner shall prepare a certification for each batch of the DFR-Diesel that meets the following requirements.
                (i) The certification shall include the report of the independent third party under paragraph (f) of this section, and the following additional information:
                (A) The name and EPA registration number of the refinery that produced the DFR-Diesel;
                (B) The identification of the diesel fuel as Certified DFR-Diesel or Non-Certified DFR-Diesel;

                (2) A declaration that the DFR-Diesel is being included in the applicable compliance calculations required by EPA under this subpart.
                (ii) The certification shall be made part of the product transfer documents for the DFR-Diesel.
                (e) Transfers of DFR-Diesel to non-United States markets. The foreign refiner is responsible to ensure that all diesel fuel classified as DFR-Diesel is imported into the United States. A foreign refiner may remove the DFR-Diesel classification, and the diesel fuel need not be imported into the United States, but only if:
                (1)(i) The foreign refiner excludes:
                (A) The volume of diesel from the refinery's compliance report under § 80.593, § 80.601, or § 80.604; and
                (B) In the case of Certified DFR-Diesel, the volume of the diesel fuel from the compliance report under § 80.593, § 80.601, or § 80.604.
                (ii) The exclusions under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall be on the basis of the designations under § 80.598 and this section, and volumes determined under paragraph (f) of this section.
                (2) The foreign refiner obtains sufficient evidence in the form of documentation that the diesel fuel was not imported into the United States.

                (2) Diesel fuel shall be classified as Certified DFR-Diesel or as Non-Certified DFR-Diesel according to the designation by the foreign refiner if this designation is supported by product transfer documents prepared by the foreign refiner as required in paragraph (d) of this section, unless the diesel fuel is classified as Non-Certified DFR-Diesel under paragraph (g) of this section. Additionally, the importer shall comply with all requirements of this subpart applicable to importers.

                (3) For each diesel fuel batch classified as DFR-Diesel, any United States importer shall perform the following procedures.
                (i) In the case of both Certified and Non-Certified DFR-Diesel, have an independent third party:
                (A) Determine the volume of diesel fuel in the vessel;
                (B) Use the foreign refiner's DFR-Diesel certification to determine the name and EPA-assigned registration number of the foreign refinery that produced the DFR-Diesel;
                (C) Determine the name and country of registration of the vessel used to transport the DFR-Diesel to the United States; and
                (D) Determine the date and time the vessel arrives at the United States port of entry.
                (ii) In the case of Certified DFR-Diesel, have an independent third party:
                (A) Collect a representative sample from each vessel compartment subsequent to the vessel's arrival at the United States port of entry and prior to off loading any diesel fuel from the vessel;
                (B) Obtain the compartment samples; and
                (C) Determine the sulfur content value, and if applicable, the marker content, of each compartment sample using an appropriate methodology as specified in §§ 80.580 through 80.586 by the third party analyzing the sample or by the third party observing the importer analyze the sample.
                (4) Any importer shall submit reports within 30 days following the date any vessel transporting DFR-Diesel arrives at the United States port of entry:
                (i) To the Administrator containing the information determined under paragraph (o)(3) of this section; and
                (ii) To the foreign refiner containing the information determined under paragraph (o)(3)(ii) of this section, and including identification of the port and Credit Trading Area at which the product was offloaded.
                (5) Any United States importer shall meet the requirements specified in §§ 80.510 and 80.520 and all other requirements of this subpart, for any imported diesel fuel or heating oil that is not classified as Certified DFR-Diesel under paragraph (o)(2) of this section.
                (p) Truck imports of Certified DFR-Diesel produced at a foreign refinery. (1) Any refiner whose Certified DFR-Diesel is transported into the United States by truck may petition EPA to use alternative procedures to meet the following requirements:

              Gasoline Toxics Performance Requirements
              
                § 80.815
                What are the gasoline toxics performance requirements for refiners and importers?
                (a)(1) The gasoline toxics performance requirements of this subpart require that the annual average toxics value of a refinery or importer be compared to that refinery's or importer's compliance baseline, where compliance has been achieved if—
                (i) For conventional gasoline, the annual average toxics value is less than or equal to the compliance baseline;
                (ii) For reformulated gasoline and RBOB, combined, the annual average toxics value is greater than or equal to the compliance baseline.
                (A) Refineries that only produce RBOB and importers that only import RBOB shall treat RBOB as reformulated gasoline for the purposes of determining compliance with the requirements of this subpart.
                (B) Refineries that produce both RFG and RBOB and importers that import both RFG and RBOB must combine any RFG and RBOB qualities and volumes for the purposes of determining compliance with the requirements of this subpart.
                (2) The requirements under this paragraph (a) shall be met by the importer for all imported gasoline, except gasoline imported as Certified Toxics-FRGAS under § 80.1030.
                (b) The gasoline toxics requirements of this subpart apply separately for each of the following types of gasoline produced at a refinery or imported:
                (1) Reformulated gasoline and RBOB, combined;
                (2) Conventional gasoline.
                (c) Compliance baseline. (1) The compliance baseline of a refinery or importer is determined in accordance with § 80.915 or § 80.855, as applicable.
                (2) Refiners who have chosen, under subpart E of this part, to comply with the requirements of subpart E of this part on an aggregate basis, shall comply with the requirements of this subpart on the same aggregate basis.
                (d) Compliance determination. (1)(i) The gasoline toxics performance requirements of this subpart apply to gasoline produced at a refinery or imported by an importer during each calendar year starting January 1, 2002. The averaging period is January 1 through December 31 of each year.
                (ii)(A) Beginning January 1, 2011, or January 1, 2015 for small refiners approved under § 80.1340, the gasoline toxics performance requirements of this subpart shall apply only to gasoline that is not subject to the benzene standard of § 80.1230, pursuant to the provisions of § 80.1235.
                (B) The gasoline toxics performance requirements of this subpart shall not apply to gasoline produced by a refinery approved under § 80.1334, pursuant to § 80.1334(c).
                (2) The annual average toxics value is calculated in accordance with § 80.825.
                (e) Deficit carryforward. (1) A refinery or importer creates a toxics deficit, separately for reformulated gasoline and conventional gasoline, for a given averaging period, when—
                (i) For conventional gasoline, its annual average toxics value is greater than the compliance baseline;
                (ii) For reformulated gasoline and RBOB, combined, the annual average toxics value is less than the compliance baseline.
                (2) In the calendar year following the year the toxics deficit is created, the refinery or importer shall:

                (i) Achieve compliance with the refinery or importer toxics performance requirement specified in paragraph (a) of this section; and
                
                (ii) Generate additional toxics credits sufficient to offset the toxics deficit of the previous year.
                (f) Credit carryforward. (1) A refinery or importer generates toxics credits, separately for reformulated gasoline and conventional gasoline, for a given averaging period, when—
                (i) For conventional gasoline, its annual average toxics value is less than the compliance baseline;
                (ii) For reformulated gasoline and RBOB, combined, the annual average toxics value is greater than the compliance baseline.
                (2) Toxics credits may be used to offset a toxics deficit in the calendar year following the year the credits are generated, provided the following criteria are met:
                (i) Reformulated gasoline toxics credits are only to be used to offset a reformulated gasoline toxics deficit; conventional gasoline credits are only to be used to offset a conventional gasoline toxics deficit.
                (ii) A refiner only offsets a toxics deficit at a refinery with toxics credits generated by that refinery.
                (iii) Credits generated on an aggregate basis may only be used to offset a deficit calculated on an aggregate basis.
                (iv) Credits used to offset a deficit from the previous year may not also be carried forward to the following year. Credits in excess of those used to offset a deficit from the previous year may be used to offset a deficit in the following year.
                (v) Only toxics credits generated under this subpart may be used to offset a toxics deficit created under this subpart.

                (iv) Any new refiner or importer without a toxics baseline that produces or imports gasoline for use in Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands shall be subject to the applicable toxics default baseline under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless the refiner or importer petitions for and receives approval of use of a seasonal baseline and seasonal Complex Model under § 80.93(d).
                (c)(1) Eligibility to petition. A refiner who has been granted an alternative anti-dumping averaging period under § 80.101(k) may petition the Administrator to have the statutory baseline exhaust toxics emissions, Phase II value specified in § 80.91(c)(5)(iv) as its compliance baseline for the purposes of this subpart J for one or more of the years of the refiner's approved alternative anti-dumping averaging period.
                (2) Application process. Applications must be submitted to the Administrator by January 1, 2004 to the following address: U.S. EPA—Attn: Anti-Dumping Compliance Period (6406J), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460 (certified mail/return receipt) or U.S. EPA—Attn: Anti-Dumping Compliance Period (6406J), Transportation & Regional Programs Division, 501 3rd Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001 (express mail/return receipt).
                (3) Contents of the application petition. Each petition must include:
                (i) A copy of the refinery's approval for an alternative averaging period under section 80.101(k).
                (ii) A description of the hardships that make it infeasible, on a cost and/or technological basis, for the refinery to comply with the compliance baseline specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
                (iii) A quarterly timeline, from the date of the application, indicating the expected exhaust toxics emissions performance of the refinery's conventional gasoline, and the reasons for any expected non-compliance with the compliance baseline specified in paragraph (b) of this section (for example, a particular gasoline blendstock-producing unit not yet installed). The timeline shall include the date by which the refinery will produce conventional gasoline that complies with the baseline specified in paragraph (b) of this section on an annual average basis.
                (4) Approval or disapproval of petitions. (i) The Administrator may approve a petition if it includes information sufficient to demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that cost and/or technological constraints make it infeasible for the refinery to comply with the baseline specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The Administrator will approve or deny a petition in writing within six months of receipt.
                (ii)(A) Each approval will specify the date by which the refinery must comply with the baseline specified in paragraph (b) of this section. No petition approval shall allow for use of the statutory baseline exhaust toxics emissions, Phase II value as a refinery's compliance baseline under this subpart J beyond the last day of a refinery's alternative anti-dumping averaging period under § 80.101(k) or § 80.101(l).

              Provisions for Foreign Refiners With Individual Toxics Baselines
              
                § 80.1030
                What are the requirements for gasoline produced at foreign refineries having individual refiner toxics baselines?
                (a) Definitions. (1) A foreign refinery is a refinery that is located outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively referred to in this section as “the United States”).
                (2) A foreign refiner is a person who meets the definition of refiner under § 80.2(i) for a foreign refinery.
                (3) Toxics-FRGAS means gasoline produced at a foreign refinery that has been assigned an individual refinery toxics baseline under § 80.915 and that is imported into the U.S.
                (4) Non-Toxics-FRGAS means gasoline that is produced at a foreign refinery that has not been assigned an individual refinery toxics baseline, gasoline produced at a foreign refinery with an individual refinery toxics baseline that is not imported into the United States, and gasoline produced at a foreign refinery with an individual toxics baseline during a year when the foreign refiner has opted to not participate in the Toxics-FRGAS program under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
                (5) Certified Toxics-FRGAS means Toxics-FRGAS the foreign refiner intends to include in the foreign refinery's toxics compliance calculations under § 80.825, and does include in these compliance calculations when reported to EPA.
                (6) Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS means Toxics-FRGAS that is not Certified Toxics-FRGAS.
                (b) Baseline establishment. Any foreign refiner may submit a petition to the Administrator for an individual refinery toxics baseline pursuant to § 80.915 for all gasoline that was produced at the foreign refinery and imported into the United States between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000.
                (1) The refiner shall follow the procedures specified in §§ 80.91 through 80.93 to establish an anti-dumping baseline, if it does not already have such a baseline.
                (2) In making determinations for foreign refinery baselines, EPA will consider all information supplied by a foreign refiner, and in addition may rely on any and all appropriate assumptions necessary to make such determinations.
                (3)(i) Where a foreign refiner submits a petition that is incomplete or inadequate to establish an accurate toxics baseline, and the refiner fails to cure this defect after a request for more information, EPA will not assign an individual refinery toxics baseline.
                (ii) If a foreign refiner does not already have an anti-dumping individual baseline per § 80.94, and if pursuant to § 80.94(b)(5) EPA does not assign an individual anti-dumping baseline, EPA will also not assign an individual refinery toxics baseline.
                (c) General requirements for foreign refiners with individual refinery toxics baselines. A foreign refiner of a refinery that has been assigned an individual toxics baseline according to § 80.915 shall designate all gasoline produced at the foreign refinery that is exported to the United States as either Certified Toxics-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
                (1) In the case of Certified Toxics-FRGAS, the foreign refiner shall meet all provisions that apply to refiners under this subpart J.
                (2) In the case of Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS, the foreign refiner shall meet all the following provisions, except the foreign refiner shall use the name Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS instead of the names “reformulated gasoline” or “RBOB” wherever they appear in the following provisions:
                (i) The designation requirements in this section.
                (ii) The recordkeeping requirements under § 80.985.
                (iii) The reporting requirements in § 80.990 and this section.
                (iv) The product transfer document requirements in this section.
                (v) The prohibitions in this section and § 80.1005.

                (vi) The independent audit requirements under § 80.1035, paragraph (h) of this section, §§ 80.125 through 80.127, § 80.128(a), (b), (c), (g) through (i), and § 80.130.
                (3)(i) Any foreign refiner that has been assigned an individual toxics baseline for a foreign refinery under § 80.915 may elect to classify no gasoline imported into the United States as Toxics-FRGAS, provided the foreign refiner notifies EPA of the election no later than November 1 of the prior calendar year.
                (ii) An election under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section shall:
                (A) Apply to an entire calendar year averaging period, and apply to all gasoline produced during the calendar year at the foreign refinery that is used in the United States; and
                (B) Remain in effect for each succeeding calendar year averaging period, unless and until the foreign refiner notifies EPA of a termination of the election. The change in election shall take effect at the beginning of the next calendar year.
                (4) In the case of information required under this section which would duplicate information submitted in accordance with § 80.94, the refiner may indicate that such information is also submitted in accordance with the requirements of this section. Duplicate submissions are not required.
                (d) Designation, product transfer documents, and foreign refiner certification. (1) Any foreign refiner of a foreign refinery that has been assigned an individual toxics baseline shall designate each batch of Toxics-FRGAS as such at the time the gasoline is produced, unless the refiner has elected to classify no gasoline exported to the United States as Toxics-FRGAS under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
                (2) On each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any Toxics-FRGAS prior to its being imported into the United States, it shall include the following information as part of the product transfer document information in this section:
                (i) Identification of the gasoline as Certified Toxics-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS; and
                (ii) The name and EPA refinery registration number of the refinery where the Toxics-FRGAS was produced.
                (3) On each occasion when Toxics-FRGAS is loaded onto a vessel or other transportation mode for transport to the United States, the foreign refiner shall prepare a written verification for each batch of the Toxics-FRGAS that meets the following requirements:
                (i) The verification shall include the report of the independent third party under paragraph (f) of this section, and the following additional information:
                (A) The name and EPA registration number of the refinery that produced the Toxics-FRGAS;
                (B) The identification of the gasoline as Certified Toxics-FRGAS or Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS;
                (C) The volume of Toxics-FRGAS being transported, in gallons;
                (D) In the case of Certified Toxics-FRGAS:
                (1) The toxics value as determined under paragraph (f) of this section; and
                (2) A declaration that the Toxics-FRGAS is being included in the compliance calculations under § 80.825 for the refinery that produced the Toxics-FRGAS.
                (ii) The verification shall be made part of the product transfer documents for the Toxics-FRGAS.
                (e) Transfers of Toxics-FRGAS to non-United States markets. The foreign refiner is responsible to ensure that all gasoline classified as Toxics-FRGAS is imported into the United States. A foreign refiner may remove the Toxics-FRGAS classification, and the gasoline need not be imported into the United States, but only if:
                (1)(i) The foreign refiner excludes:
                (A) The volume of gasoline from the refinery's compliance calculations under § 80.825; and
                (B) In the case of Certified Toxics-FRGAS, the volume and toxics value of the gasoline from the compliance calculations under § 80.825.
                (ii) The exclusions under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section shall be on the basis of the toxics value and volumes determined under paragraph (f) of this section; and
                (2) The foreign refiner obtains sufficient evidence in the form of documentation that the gasoline was not imported into the United States.
                (f) Load port independent sampling, testing and refinery identification. (1) On each occasion Toxics-FRGAS is loaded onto a vessel for transport to the United States a foreign refiner shall have an independent third party:
                (i) Inspect the vessel prior to loading and determine the volume of any tank bottoms;
                (ii) Determine the volume of Toxics-FRGAS loaded onto the vessel (exclusive of any tank bottoms present before vessel loading);
                (iii) Obtain the EPA-assigned registration number of the foreign refinery;
                (iv) Determine the name and country of registration of the vessel used to transport the Toxics-FRGAS to the United States; and
                (v) Determine the date and time the vessel departs the port serving the foreign refinery.
                (2) On each occasion Certified Toxics-FRGAS is loaded onto a vessel for transport to the United States a foreign refiner shall have an independent third party:
                (i) Collect a representative sample of the Certified Toxics-FRGAS from each vessel compartment subsequent to loading on the vessel and prior to departure of the vessel from the port serving the foreign refinery;
                (ii) Prepare a volume-weighted vessel composite sample from the compartment samples, and determine the value for toxics using the methodology specified in § 80.730 by:
                (A) The third party analyzing the sample; or
                (B) The third party observing the foreign refiner analyze the sample;
                (iii) Review original documents that reflect movement and storage of the Certified Toxics-FRGAS from the refinery to the load port, and from this review determine:
                (A) The refinery at which the Toxics-FRGAS was produced; and
                (B) That the Toxics-FRGAS remained segregated from:
                (1) Non-Toxics-FRGAS and Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS; and
                (2) Other Certified Toxics-FRGAS produced at a different refinery.
                (3) The independent third party shall submit a report:
                (i) To the foreign refiner containing the information required under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, to accompany the product transfer documents for the vessel; and
                (ii) To the Administrator containing the information required under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, within thirty days following the date of the independent third party's inspection. This report shall include a description of the method used to determine the identity of the refinery at which the gasoline was produced, assurance that the gasoline remained segregated as specified in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, and a description of the gasoline's movement and storage between production at the source refinery and vessel loading.
                (4) The independent third party shall:
                (i) Be approved in advance by EPA, based on a demonstration of ability to perform the procedures required in this paragraph (f);
                (ii) Be independent under the criteria specified in § 80.65(e)(2)(iii); and
                (iii) Sign a commitment that contains the provisions specified in paragraph (i) of this section with regard to activities, facilities and documents relevant to compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (f).
                (g) Comparison of load port and port of entry testing. (1)(i) Except as described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, any foreign refiner and any United States importer of Certified Toxics-FRGAS shall compare the results from the load port testing under paragraph (f) of this section, with the port of entry testing as reported under paragraph (o) of this section, for the volume of gasoline and the toxics value.
                (ii) Where a vessel transporting Certified Toxics-FRGAS off loads this gasoline at more than one United States port of entry, and the conditions of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section are met at the first United States port of entry, the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section do not apply at subsequent ports of entry if the United States importer obtains a certification from the vessel owner, that meets the requirements of paragraph (s) of this section, that the vessel has not loaded any gasoline or blendstock between the first United States port of entry and the subsequent port of entry.
                (2)(i) The requirements of this paragraph (g)(2) apply if:

                (A) The temperature-corrected volumes determined at the port of entry and at the load port differ by more than one percent; or
                (B) The toxics value determined at the port of entry is higher than the toxics value determined at the load port, and the amount of this difference is greater than the reproducibility amount specified for the port of entry test result by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM).
                (ii) The United States importer and the foreign refiner shall treat the gasoline as Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS, and the foreign refiner shall exclude the gasoline volume and properties from its gasoline toxics compliance calculations under § 80.825.
                (h) Attest requirements. The following additional procedures shall be carried out by any foreign refiner of Toxics-FRGAS as part of the applicable attest engagement for each foreign refinery under § 80.1035:

By submitting a petition for an individual foreign refinery baseline under this section, or by producing and exporting gasoline to the United States under an individual refinery toxics baseline under this section, the foreign refiner, its agents and employees, without exception, become subject to the full operation of the administrative and judicial enforcement powers and provisions of the United States without limitation based on sovereign immunity, with respect to actions instituted against the foreign refiner, its agents and employees in any court or other tribunal in the United States for conduct that violates the requirements applicable to the foreign refiner under this subpart J, including conduct that violates Title 18 U.S.C. section 1001 and Clean Air Act section 113(c)(2).
                (k) Bond posting. Any foreign refiner shall meet the requirements of this paragraph (k) as a condition to being assigned an individual refinery toxics baseline.

                (1) The foreign refiner shall annually post a bond of the amount calculated using the following equation:
                
                Bond = G × $ 0.01 − BondCG
                
                
                
                  Where:
                  

                  Bond = amount of the bond in U. S. dollars.
                  
                  G = the largest volume of gasoline produced at the foreign refinery and exported to the United States, in gallons, during a single calendar year among the five preceding calendar years.
                  BondCG = amount of bond currently posted by the refinery pursuant to § 80.94.
                
                
                (2) Bonds shall be posted by:
                (i) Paying the amount of the bond to the Treasurer of the United States;
                (ii) Obtaining a bond in the proper amount from a third party surety agent that is payable to satisfy United States administrative or judicial judgments against the foreign refiner, provided EPA agrees in advance as to the third party and the nature of the surety agreement; or
                (iii) An alternative commitment that results in assets of an appropriate liquidity and value being readily available to the United States, provided EPA agrees in advance as to the alternative commitment.
                (3) If the bond amount for a foreign refinery increases, the foreign refiner shall increase the bond to cover the shortfall within 90 days of the date the bond amount changes. If the bond amount decreases, the foreign refiner may reduce the amount of the bond beginning 90 days after the date the bond amount changes.
                (4) Bonds posted under this paragraph (k) shall:
                (i) Be used to satisfy any judicial or administrative judgment, order, assessment or payment under a judicial or administrative settlement agreement that results from an administrative or judicial enforcement action for conduct in violation of this subpart J, including where such conduct violates Title 18 U.S.C. section 1001 and Clean Air Act section 113(c)(2);
                (ii) Be provided by a corporate surety that is listed in the United States Department of Treasury Circular 570 “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds'; and
                (iii) Include a commitment that the bond will remain in effect for at least five (5) years following the end of latest averaging period that the foreign refiner produces gasoline pursuant to the requirements of this subpart J.
                (5) On any occasion a foreign refiner bond is used to satisfy any judgment or other obligation, the foreign refiner shall increase the bond to cover the amount used within 90 days of the date the bond is used.
                (6) The bond is used for payment of, not in lieu of, any obligation arising under any judgment, order, assessment or settlement agreement. Nothing herein is intended to waive any portion of any obligation except what portion is actually paid by use of funds from the bond.
                (l) [Reserved]
                (m) English language reports. Any report or other document submitted to EPA by a foreign refiner shall be in English language, or shall include an English language translation.
                (n) Prohibitions. (1) No person may combine Certified Toxics-FRGAS with any Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS or Non-Toxics-FRGAS, and no person may combine Certified Toxics-FRGAS with any Certified Toxics-FRGAS produced at a different refinery, until the importer has met all the requirements of paragraph (o) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
                (2) No foreign refiner or other person may cause another person to commit an action prohibited in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, or that otherwise violates the requirements of this section.
                (o) United States importer requirements. Any United States importer shall meet the following requirements:
                (1) Each batch of imported gasoline shall be classified by the importer as being Toxics-FRGAS or as Non-Toxics-FRGAS, and each batch classified as Toxics-FRGAS shall be further classified as Certified Toxics-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS.
                (2) Gasoline shall be classified as Certified Toxics-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS according to the designation by the foreign refiner if this designation is supported by product transfer documents prepared by the foreign refiner as required in paragraph (d) of this section, unless the gasoline is classified as Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS under paragraph (g) of this section.

                (3) For each gasoline batch classified as Toxics-FRGAS, any United States importer shall perform the following procedures:
                
                (i) In the case of both Certified and Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS, have an independent third party:
                (A) Determine the volume of gasoline in the vessel;
                (B) Use the foreign refiner's Toxics-FRGAS certification to determine the name and EPA-assigned registration number of the foreign refinery that produced the Toxics-FRGAS;
                (C) Determine the name and country of registration of the vessel used to transport the Toxics-FRGAS to the United States; and
                (D) Determine the date and time the vessel arrives at the United States port of entry.
                (ii) In the case of Certified Toxics-FRGAS, have an independent third party:
                (A) Collect a representative sample from each vessel compartment subsequent to the vessel's arrival at the United States port of entry and prior to off loading any gasoline from the vessel;
                (B) Prepare a volume-weighted vessel composite sample from the compartment samples; and
                (C) Determine the toxics value using the methodologies specified in § 80.730, by:
                (1) The third party analyzing the sample; or
                (2) The third party observing the importer analyze the sample.
                (4) Any importer shall submit reports within thirty days following the date any vessel transporting Toxics-FRGAS arrives at the United States port of entry:
                (i) To the Administrator containing the information determined under paragraph (o)(3) of this section; and
                (ii) To the foreign refiner containing the information determined under paragraph (o)(3)(ii) of this section.
                (5) Any United States importer shall meet the requirements specified in § 80.815 for any imported gasoline that is not classified as Certified Toxics-FRGAS under paragraph (o)(2) of this section.
                (p) Truck imports of Certified Toxics-FRGAS produced at a Refinery (1) Any refiner whose Certified Toxics-FRGAS is transported into the United States by truck may petition EPA to use alternative procedures to meet the following requirements:
                (i) Certification under paragraph (d)(5) of this section;
                (ii) Load port and port of entry sampling and testing under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section;
                (iii) Attest under paragraph (h) of this section; and
                (iv) Importer testing under paragraph (o)(3) of this section.
                (2) These alternative procedures shall ensure Certified Toxics-FRGAS remains segregated from Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS and from Non-Toxics-FRGAS until it is imported into the United States. The petition will be evaluated based on whether it adequately addresses the following:
                (i) Provisions for monitoring pipeline shipments, if applicable, from the refinery, that ensure segregation of Certified Toxics-FRGAS from that refinery from all other gasoline;
                (ii) Contracts with any terminals and/or pipelines that receive and/or transport Certified Toxics-FRGAS, that prohibit the commingling of Certified Toxics-FRGAS with any of the following:
                (A) Other Certified Toxics-FRGAS from other refineries.
                (B) All Non-Certified Toxics-FRGAS.
                (C) All Non-Toxics-FRGAS;
                (iii) Procedures for obtaining and reviewing truck loading records and United States import documents for Certified Toxics-FRGAS to ensure that such gasoline is only loaded into trucks making deliveries to the United States;
                (iv) Attest procedures to be conducted annually by an independent third party that review loading records and import documents based on volume reconciliation, or other criteria, to confirm that all Certified Toxics-FRGAS remains segregated throughout the distribution system and is only loaded into trucks for import into the United States.

                (3) The petition required by this section shall be submitted to EPA along with the application for small refiner status and individual refinery toxics baseline and standards under § 80.240 and this section.
                
                (q) Withdrawal or suspension of a foreign refinery's baseline. EPA may withdraw or suspend a baseline that has been assigned to a foreign refinery where:
                (1) A foreign refiner fails to meet any requirement of this section;
                (2) A foreign government fails to allow EPA inspections as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section;
                (3) A foreign refiner asserts a claim of, or a right to claim, sovereign immunity in an action to enforce the requirements in this subpart J; or
                (4) A foreign refiner fails to pay a civil or criminal penalty that is not satisfied using the foreign refiner bond specified in paragraph (k) of this section.
                (r) Early use of a foreign refinery baseline. (1) A foreign refiner may begin using an individual refinery baseline before EPA has approved the baseline, provided that:
                (i) A baseline petition has been submitted as required in paragraph (b) of this section;
                (ii) EPA has made a provisional finding that the baseline petition is complete;
                (iii) The foreign refiner has made the commitments required in paragraph (i) of this section;
                (iv) The persons who will meet the independent third party and independent attest requirements for the foreign refinery have made the commitments required in paragraphs (f)(3)(iii) and (h)(7)(iii) of this section; and
                (v) The foreign refiner has met the bond requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.
                (2) In any case where a foreign refiner uses an individual refinery baseline before final approval under paragraph (r)(1) of this section, and the foreign refinery baseline values that ultimately are approved by EPA are more stringent than the early baseline values used by the foreign refiner, the foreign refiner shall recalculate its compliance, ab initio, using the baseline values approved by EPA, and the foreign refiner shall be liable for any resulting violation of the gasoline toxics requirements.
                (s) Additional requirements for petitions, reports and certificates. Any petition for a refinery baseline under § 80.915, any alternative procedures under paragraph (r) of this section, any report or other submission required by paragraph (c), (f)(2), or (i) of this section, and any certification under paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall be:
                (1) Submitted in accordance with procedures specified by the Administrator, including use of any forms that may be specified by the Administrator.

                (2) Be signed by the president or owner of the foreign refiner company, or by that person's immediate designee, and shall contain the following declaration:
                
                
                  I hereby certify: (1) That I have actual authority to sign on behalf of and to bind [insert name of foreign refiner] with regard to all statements contained herein; (2) that I am aware that the information contained herein is being certified, or submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, under the requirements of 40 CFR Part 80, subpart J, and that the information is material for determining compliance under these regulations; and (3) that I have read and understand the information being certified or submitted, and this information is true, complete and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief after I have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to verify the accuracy thereof.
                  I affirm that I have read and understand the provisions of 40 CFR Part 80, subpart J, including 40 CFR 80.1030 [insert name of foreign refiner]. Pursuant to Clean Air Act section 113(c) and Title 18, United States Code, section 1001, the penalty for furnishing false, incomplete or misleading information in this certification or submission is a fine of up to $10,000, and/or imprisonment for up to five years.

            Subpart K—Renewable Fuel Standard
            
              § 80.1100
              How is the statutory default requirement for 2006 implemented?
              (a) Definitions. For calendar year 2006, the definitions of section 80.2 and the following additional definitions apply to this section.
              (1) Renewable fuel. (i) Renewable fuel means motor vehicle fuel that is used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel present in a fuel mixture used to operate a motor vehicle, and which:
              (A) Is produced from grain, starch, oil seeds, vegetable, animal, or fish materials including fats, greases, and oils, sugarcane, sugar beets, sugar components, tobacco, potatoes, or other biomass; or
              (B) Is natural gas produced from a biogas source, including a landfill, sewage waste treatment plant, feedlot, or other place where decaying organic material is found.
              (ii) The term “renewable fuel” includes cellulosic biomass ethanol, waste derived ethanol, biodiesel, and any blending components derived from renewable fuel.
              (2) Cellulosic biomass ethanol means ethanol derived from any lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter that is available on a renewable or recurring basis, including dedicated energy crops and trees, wood and wood residues, plants, grasses, agricultural residues, fibers, animal wastes and other waste materials, and municipal solid waste. The term also includes any ethanol produced in facilities where animal wastes or other waste materials are digested or otherwise used to displace 90 percent or more of the fossil fuel normally used in the production of ethanol.
              (3) Waste derived ethanol means ethanol derived from animal wastes, including poultry fats and poultry wastes, and other waste materials, or municipal solid waste.
              
              (4) Small refinery means a refinery for which the average aggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year (as determined by dividing the aggregate throughput for the calendar year by the number of days in the calendar year) does not exceed 75,000 barrels.
              (5) Biodiesel means a diesel fuel substitute produced from nonpetroleum renewable resources that meets the registration requirements for fuels and fuel additives established by the Environmental Protection Agency under section 211 of the Clean Air Act. It includes biodiesel derived from animal wastes (including poultry fats and poultry wastes) and other waste materials, or biodiesel derived from municipal solid waste and sludges and oils derived from wastewater and the treatment of wastewater.
              (b) Renewable Fuel Standard for 2006. The percentage of renewable fuel in the total volume of gasoline sold or dispensed to consumers in 2006 in the United States shall be a minimum of 2.78 percent on an annual average volume basis.
              (c) Responsible parties. Parties collectively responsible for attainment of the standard in paragraph (b) of this section are refiners (including blenders) and importers of gasoline. However, a party that is a refiner only because he owns or operates a small refinery is exempt from this responsibility.
              (d) EPA determination of attainment. EPA will determine after the close of 2006 whether or not the requirement in paragraph (b) of this section has been met. EPA will base this determination on information routinely published by the Energy Information Administration on the annual domestic volume of gasoline sold or dispensed to U.S. consumers and of ethanol produced for use in such gasoline, supplemented by readily available information concerning the use in motor fuel of other renewable fuels such as cellulosic biomass ethanol, waste derived ethanol, biodiesel, and other non-ethanol renewable fuels.
              (1) The renewable fuel volume will equal the sum of all renewable fuel volumes used in motor fuel, provided that:
              (i) One gallon of cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste derived ethanol shall be considered to be the equivalent of 2.5 gallons of renewable fuel; and
              (ii) Only the renewable fuel portion of blending components derived from renewable fuel shall be counted towards the renewable fuel volume.
              (2) If the nationwide average volume percent of renewable fuel in gasoline in 2006 is equal to or greater than the standard in paragraph (b) of this section, the standard has been met.
              (e) Consequence of nonattainment in 2006. In the event that EPA determines that the requirement in paragraph (b) of this section has not been attained in 2006, a deficit carryover volume shall be added to the renewable fuel volume obligation for 2007 for use in calculating the standard applicable to gasoline in 2007.

              (1) The deficit carryover volume shall be calculated as follows:
              
              DC = Vgas * (Rs−Ra)
              
              
                Where:
                
                DC = Deficit carryover, in gallons, of renewable fuel.
                Vgas = Volume of gasoline sold or dispensed to U.S. consumers in 2006, in gallons.
                Rs = 0.0278.
                Ra = Ratio of renewable fuel volume divided by total gasoline volume determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
              
              
              (2) There shall be no other consequence of failure to attain the standard in paragraph (b) of this section in 2006 for any of the parties in paragraph (c) of this section.

              To whom does the Renewable Volume Obligation apply?
              (a) (1) An obligated party is a refiner that produces gasoline within the 48 contiguous states, or an importer that imports gasoline into the 48 contiguous states. A party that simply adds renewable fuel to gasoline, as defined in § 80.1107(c), is not an obligated party.
              (2) If the Administrator approves a petition of Alaska, Hawaii, or a United States territory to opt-in to the renewable fuel program under the provisions in § 80.1143, then “obligated party” shall also include any refiner that produces gasoline within that state or territory, or any importer that imports gasoline into that state or territory.

              (3) For the purposes of this section, “gasoline” refers to any and all of the products specified at § 80.1107(c).
              
              (b) For each compliance period starting with 2007, any obligated party is required to demonstrate, pursuant to § 80.1127, that it has satisfied the Renewable Volume Obligation for that compliance period, as specified in § 80.1107(a).
              (c) An obligated party may comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for all of its refineries in the aggregate, or for each refinery individually.
              (d) An obligated party must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for all of its imported gasoline in the aggregate.
              (e) An obligated party that is both a refiner and importer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for its imported gasoline separately from gasoline produced by its refinery or refineries.
              (f) Where a refinery or importer is jointly owned by two or more parties, the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section may be met by one of the joint owners for all of the gasoline produced at the refinery, or all of the imported gasoline, in the aggregate, or each party may meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for the portion of the gasoline that it owns, as long as all of the gasoline produced at the refinery, or all of the imported gasoline, is accounted for in determining the renewable fuels obligation under § 80.1107.
              (g) The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section apply to the following compliance periods:
              (1) For 2007, the compliance period is September 1 through December 31.
              (2) Beginning in 2008, and every year thereafter, the compliance period is January 1 through December 31.

              (1) Cellulosic biomass ethanol and waste derived ethanol produced on or before December 31, 2012 which is denatured shall have an equivalence value of 2.5.
              (2) Ethanol other than cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste-derived ethanol which is denatured shall have an equivalence value of 1.0.
              (3) Biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) shall have an equivalence value of 1.5.
              (4) Butanol shall have an equivalence value of 1.3.
              (5) Non-ester renewable diesel, including that produced from coprocessing a renewable crude with fossil fuels in a hydrotreater, shall have an equivalence value of 1.7.
              (6) All other renewable crude-based renewable fuels shall have an equivalence value of 1.0.
              (c)(1) For renewable fuels not listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a producer or importer shall submit an application to the Agency for an equivalence value following the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) A producer or importer may also submit an application for an alternative equivalence value pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section if the renewable fuel is listed in paragraph (b) of this section, but the producer or importer has reason to believe that a different equivalence value than that listed in paragraph (b) of this section is warranted.
              (d) Determination of equivalence values. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the equivalence value for renewable fuels described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be calculated using the following formula:
              
              EV = (R / 0.931) * (EC / 77,550)
              
              
                Where:
                
                EV = Equivalence Value for the renewable fuel, rounded to the nearest tenth.

                R = Renewable content of the renewable fuel. This is a measure of the portion of a renewable fuel that came from a renewable source, expressed as a percent, on an energy basis.
                EC = Energy content of the renewable fuel, in Btu per gallon (lower heating value).
              
              
              (2) The application for an equivalence value shall include a technical justification that includes a description of the renewable fuel, feedstock(s) used to make it, and the production process.
              (3) The Agency will review the technical justification and assign an appropriate Equivalence Value to the renewable fuel based on the procedure in this paragraph (d).
              (4) For biogas, the Equivalence Value is 1.0, and 77,550 Btu of biogas is equivalent to 1 gallon of renewable fuel.

              § 80.1126
              How are RINs generated and assigned to batches of renewable fuel by renewable fuel producers or importers?
              (a) Regional applicability. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a batch RIN must be generated by a renewable fuel producer or importer for every batch of renewable fuel produced by a facility located in the contiguous 48 states of the United States, or imported into the contiguous 48 states.
              (2) If the Administrator approves a petition of Alaska, Hawaii, or a United States territory to opt-in to the renewable fuel program under the provisions in § 80.1143, then the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall also apply to renewable fuel produced or imported into that state or territory beginning in the next calendar year.
              (b) Volume threshold. Renewable fuel producers located within the United States that produce less than 10,000 gallons of renewable fuel each year, and importers that import less than 10,000 gallons of renewable fuel each year, are not required to generate and assign RINs to batches of renewable fuel. Such producers and importers are also exempt from the registration, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements of §§ 80.1150-80.1152, and the attest engagement requirements of § 80.1164. However, for such producers and importers that voluntarily generate and assign RINs, all the requirements of this subpart apply.
              (c) Definition of batch. For the purposes of this section and § 80.1125, a “batch of renewable fuel” is a volume of renewable fuel that has been assigned a unique RIN code BBBBB within a calendar year by the producer or importer of the renewable fuel in accordance with the provisions of this section and § 80.1125.
              (1) The number of gallon-RINs generated for a batch of renewable fuel may not exceed 99,999,999.
              (2) A batch of renewable fuel cannot represent renewable fuel produced or imported in excess of one calendar month.
              (d) Generation of RINs. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the producer or importer of a batch of renewable fuel must generate a batch-RIN for that batch, including any renewable fuel contained in imported gasoline.
              (2) A producer or importer of renewable fuel may generate RINs for volumes of renewable fuel that it owns on September 1, 2007.
              (3) A party generating a RIN shall specify the appropriate numerical values for each component of the RIN in accordance with the provisions of § 80.1125 and this paragraph (d).

              (4) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated for a given batch of renewable fuel shall be equal to a volume calculated according to the following formula:
              
              VRIN = EV * Vs
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                VRIN = RIN volume, in gallons, for use determining the number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated.
                EV = Equivalence value for the renewable fuel per § 80.1115.
                Vs = Standardized volume of the batch of renewable fuel at 60 °F, in gallons, calculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
              
              
              (5) Multiple gallon-RINs generated to represent a given volume of renewable fuel can be represented by a single batch-RIN through the appropriate designation of the RIN volume codes SSSSSSSS and EEEEEEEE.
              (i) The value of SSSSSSSS in the batch-RIN shall be 00000001 to represent the first gallon-RIN associated with the volume of renewable fuel.
              (ii) The value of EEEEEEEE in the batch-RIN shall represent the last gallon-RIN associated with the volume of renewable fuel, based on the RIN volume determined pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
              (6) (i) For renewable crude-based renewable fuels produced in a facility or unit that coprocesses renewable crudes and fossil fuels, the number of gallon-RINs that shall be generated for a given batch of renewable fuel shall be equal to the gallons of renewable crude used rather than the gallons of renewable fuel produced.
              (ii) Parties that produce renewable crude-based renewable fuels in a facility or unit that coprocesses renewable crudes and fossil fuels may submit a petition to the Agency requesting the use of volumes of renewable fuel produced as the basis for the number of gallon-RINs, pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
              (7) Standardization of volumes. In determining the standardized volume of a batch of renewable fuel for purposes of generating RINs under this paragraph (d), the batch volumes shall be adjusted to a standard temperature of 60 °F.
              (i) For ethanol, the following formula shall be used:
              
              Vs,e = Va,e * (−0.0006301 * T + 1.0378)
              
              
                Where:
                
                Vs,e = Standardized volume of ethanol at 60 °F, in gallons.
                Va,e = Actual volume of ethanol, in gallons.
                T = Actual temperature of the batch, in °F.
              
              

              (ii) For biodiesel (mono alkyl esters), the following formula shall be used:
              
              Vs,b = Va,b * (−0.0008008 * T + 1.0480)
              
              
                Where:
                
                Vs,b = Standardized volume of biodiesel at 60 °F, in gallons.
                Va,b = Actual volume of biodiesel, in gallons.
                T = Actual temperature of the batch, in °F.
              
              

              (iii) For other renewable fuels, an appropriate formula commonly accepted by the industry shall be used to standardize the actual volume to 60 °F. Formulas used must be reported to the Agency, and may be reviewed for appropriateness.
              
              (8) (i) A party is prohibited from generating RINs for a volume of renewable fuel that it produces if:
              (A) The renewable fuel has been produced from a chemical conversion process that uses another renewable fuel as a feedstock; and
              (B) The renewable fuel used as a feedstock was produced by another party.
              (ii) Any RINs that the party acquired with renewable fuel used as a feedstock shall be assigned to the new renewable fuel that was made with that feedstock.
              (e) Assignment of RINs to batches. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the producer or importer of renewable fuel must assign all RINs generated to volumes of renewable fuel.
              (2) A RIN is assigned to a volume of renewable fuel when ownership of the RIN is transferred along with the transfer of ownership of the volume of renewable fuel, pursuant to § 80.1128(a).
              (3) All assigned RINs shall have a K code value of 1.
              (4) RINs not assigned to batches. (i) If a party produces or imports a batch of cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste-derived ethanol having an equivalence value of 2.5, that party must assign at least one gallon-RIN to each gallon of cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste-derived ethanol, representing the first 1.0 portion of the Equivalence Value.
              (ii) Any remaining gallon-RINs generated for the cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste-derived ethanol which represent the remaining 1.5 portion of the Equivalence Value may remain unassigned.
              (iii) The producer or importer of cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste-derived ethanol shall designate the K code as 2 for all unassigned RINs.

              § 80.1127
              How are RINs used to demonstrate compliance?
              (a) Renewable volume obligations. (1) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, each party that is obligated to meet the Renewable Volume Obligation under § 80.1107, or each party that is an exporter of renewable fuels that is obligated to meet a Renewable Volume Obligation under § 80.1130, must demonstrate pursuant to § 80.1152(a)(1) that it has taken ownership of sufficient RINs to satisfy the following equation:
              
              (∑RINNUM)i + (∑RINNUM)i−1 = RVOi
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                (∑RINNUM)i = Sum of all owned gallon-RINs that were generated in year i and are being applied towards the RVOi, in gallons.
                (∑RINNUM)i−1 = Sum of all owned gallon-RINs that were generated in year i−1 and are being applied towards the RVOi, in gallons.
                RVOi = The Renewable Volume Obligation for the obligated party or renewable fuel exporter for calendar year i, in gallons, pursuant to § 80.1107 or § 80.1130.
              
              

              (2) For compliance for calendar years 2008 and later, the value of (∑RINNUM)i−1 may not exceed a value determined by the following inequality:
              
              (∑RINNUM)i−1 ≤0.20 × RVOi
              
              
              (3) RINs may only be used to demonstrate compliance with the RVO for the calendar year in which they were generated or the following calendar year. RINs used to demonstrate compliance in one year cannot be used to demonstrate compliance in any other year.
              (4) A party may only use a RIN for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if that RIN is an unassigned RIN with a K code of 2 obtained in accordance with §§ 80.1126(e)(4), 80.1128, and 80.1129.

              (5) The number of gallon-RINs associated with a given batch-RIN that can be used for compliance with the RVO shall be calculated from the following formula:
              
              RINNUM = EEEEEEEE−SSSSSSSS + 1
              
              
                Where:
                
                RINNUM = Number of gallon-RINs associated with a batch-RIN, where each gallon-RIN represents one gallon of renewable fuel for compliance purposes.
                EEEEEEEE = Batch-RIN component identifying the last gallon-RIN associated with the batch-RIN.
                SSSSSSSS = Batch-RIN component identifying the first gallon-RIN associated with the batch-RIN.
              
              
              
              (b) Deficit carryovers. (1) An obligated party or an exporter of renewable fuel that fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section for calendar year i is permitted to carry a deficit into year i + 1 under the following conditions:
              (i) The party did not carry a deficit into calendar year i from calendar year i−1.
              (ii) The party subsequently meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section for calendar year i + 1 and carries no deficit into year i + 2.

              (2) A deficit is calculated according to the following formula:
              
              Di = RVOi - [(ΣRINNUM)i + (ΣRINNUM)i-1]
              
              
                Where:
                
                Di = The deficit, in gallons, generated in calendar year i that must be carried over to year i + 1 if allowed to do so pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
                RVOi = The Renewable Volume Obligation for the obligated party or renewable fuel exporter for calendar year i, in gallons.
                (ΣRINNUM)i = Sum of all acquired gallon-RINs that were generated in year i and are being applied towards the RVOi, in gallons.
                (ΣRINNUM)i-1 = Sum of all acquired gallon-RINs that were generated in year i-1 and are being applied towards the RVOi, in gallons.

              (3) An assigned RIN cannot be transferred to another party without simultaneously transferring a volume of renewable fuel to that same party.
              (4) No more than 2.5 assigned gallon-RINs with a K code of 1 can be transferred to another party with every gallon of renewable fuel transferred to that same party.

              (5)(i) On each of the dates listed in paragraph (a)(5)(v) of this section in any calendar year, the following equation must be satisfied for assigned RINs and volumes of renewable fuel owned by a party:
              
              ∑(RIN)D ≤∑(Vsi × EVi)D
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                D = Applicable date.
                ∑(RIN)D = Sum of all assigned gallon-RINs with a K code of 1 that are owned on date D.
                (Vsi)D = Volume i of renewable fuel owned on date D, standardized to 60 °F, in gallons.
                EVi = Equivalence value representing volume i.
                ∑(Vsi × EVi)D = Sum of all volumes of renewable fuel owned on date D, multiplied by their respective equivalence values.
              
              
              (ii) The equivalence value EVi for use in the equation in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section for any volume of renewable fuel shall be 2.5.
              (iii) The applicable dates are March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. For 2007 only, the applicable dates are September 30 and December 31.
              (6) Any transfer of ownership of assigned RINs must be documented on product transfer documents generated pursuant to § 80.1153.
              (i) The RIN must be recorded on the product transfer document used to transfer ownership of the RIN and the volume to another party; or
              (ii) The RIN must be recorded on a separate product transfer document transferred to the same party on the same day as the product transfer document used to transfer ownership of the volume of renewable fuel.
              (b) RINs not assigned to volumes of renewable fuel. (1) Unassigned RIN, for the purposes of this subpart, means a RIN with a K code of 2 that has been separated from a volume of renewable fuel pursuant to § 80.1126(e)(4) or § 80.1129.
              (2) Any party that has registered pursuant to § 80.1150 can hold title to an unassigned RIN.
              (3) Unassigned RINs can be transferred from one party to another any number of times.

              (4) An unassigned batch-RIN can be divided by its holder into multiple batch-RINs, each representing a smaller number of gallon-RINs, if all of the following conditions are met:
              
              (i) All RIN components other than SSSSSSSS and EEEEEEEE are identical for the original parent and newly formed daughter RINs.
              (ii) The sum of the gallon-RINs associated with the multiple daughter batch-RINs is equal to the gallon-RINs associated with the parent batch-RIN.

              § 80.1129
              Requirements for separating RINs from volumes of renewable fuel.
              (a)(1) Separation of a RIN from a volume of renewable fuel means termination of the assignment of the RIN to a volume of renewable fuel.
              (2) RINs that have been separated from volumes of renewable fuel become unassigned RINs subject to the provisions of § 80.1128(b).
              (b) A RIN that is assigned to a volume of renewable fuel is separated from that volume only under one of the following conditions:
              (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(6) and (b)(8) of this section, a party that is an obligated party according to § 80.1106 must separate any RINs that have been assigned to a volume of renewable fuel if they own that volume.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, any party that owns a volume of renewable fuel must separate any RINs that have been assigned to that volume once the volume is blended with gasoline or diesel to produce a motor vehicle fuel. A party may separate up to 2.5 RINs per gallon of fuel that is blended.
              (3) Any party that exports a volume of renewable fuel must separate any RINs that have been assigned to the exported volume.
              (4) Any party that produces, imports, owns, sells or uses a volume of neat renewable fuel may separate any RINs that have been assigned to that volume of neat renewable fuel if the party designates the neat renewable fuel as motor vehicle fuel, and the neat renewable fuel is used as a motor vehicle fuel.
              (5) RINs assigned to a volume of biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) can only be separated from that volume pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section if such biodiesel is blended into diesel fuel at a concentration of 80 volume percent biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) or less.
              (i) This paragraph (b)(5) shall not apply to obligated parties or exporters of renewable fuel.
              (ii) This paragraph (b)(5) shall not apply to any party meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (6) For RINs that an obligated party generates from renewable fuel that has not been blended into gasoline, the obligated party can only separate such RINs from volumes of renewable fuel if the number of gallon-RINs separated is less than or equal to its annual RVO.
              (7) A producer or importer of cellulosic biomass ethanol or waste-derived ethanol can separate a portion of the RINs that it generates pursuant to § 80.1126(e)(4).
              (8) For a party that has received a small refinery exemption under § 80.1141 or a small refiner exemption under § 80.1142, and who is not otherwise an obligated party, during the period of time that the small refinery or small refiner exemption is in effect the party may only separate RINs that have been assigned to volumes of renewable fuel that the party blends into motor vehicle fuel in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
              (c) The party responsible for separating a RIN from a volume of renewable fuel shall change the K code in the RIN from a value of 1 to a value of 2 prior to transferring the RIN to any other party.
              (d) Upon and after separation of a RIN from its associated volume, product transfer documents used to transfer ownership of the volume must continue to meet the requirements of § 80.1153(a)(5)(iii).
              (e) Any obligated party that uses a renewable fuel in a boiler or heater must retire any RINs associated with that volume of renewable fuel and report the retired RINs in the applicable reports under § 80.1152.

              Requirements for exporters of renewable fuels.
              (a) Any party that owns any amount of renewable fuel (in its neat form or blended with gasoline or diesel) that is exported from the region described in § 80.1126(a) shall acquire sufficient RINs to offset a Renewable Volume Obligation representing the exported renewable fuel.
              (b) Renewable Volume Obligations. An exporter of renewable fuel shall determine its Renewable Volume Obligation from the volumes of the renewable fuel exported.

              (1) A renewable fuel exporter's total Renewable Volume Obligation shall be calculated according to the following formula:
              
              RVOi = (VOLk * EVk)i + Di-1
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                RVOi = The Renewable Volume Obligation for the exporter for calendar year i, in gallons of renewable fuel.
                k = A discrete volume of renewable fuel.
                VOLk = The standardized volume of discrete volume k of exported renewable fuel, in gallons, calculated in accordance with § 80.1126(d)(7).
                EVk = The equivalence value associated with discrete volume k.
                 = Sum involving all volumes of renewable fuel exported.
                Di-1 = Renewable fuel deficit carryover from the previous year, in gallons.
              
              
              (2)(i) If the equivalence value for a volume of renewable fuel can be determined pursuant to § 80.1115 based on its composition, then the appropriate equivalence value shall be used in the calculation of the exporter's Renewable Volume Obligation.

              (ii) If the equivalence value for a volume of renewable fuel cannot be determined, the value of EVk shall be 1.0.
              (c) Each exporter of renewable fuel must demonstrate compliance with its RVO using RINs it has acquired pursuant to § 80.1127.

              Treatment of invalid RINs.
              (a) Invalid RINs. An invalid RIN is a RIN that is any of the following:
              (1) Is a duplicate of a valid RIN.
              (2) Was based on volumes that have not been standardized to 60 °F.
              (3) Has expired.
              (4) Was based on an incorrect equivalence value.
              (5) Is deemed invalid under § 80.1167(g).
              (6) Does not represent renewable fuel as it is defined in § 80.1101.
              (7) Was otherwise improperly generated.
              (8) In the event that the same RIN is transferred to two or more parties, all such RINs will be deemed to be invalid, unless EPA in its sole discretion determines that some portion of these RINs is valid.
              (b) In the case of RINs that are invalid, the following provisions apply:
              (1) Invalid RINs cannot be used to achieve compliance with the Renewable Volume Obligation of an obligated party or exporter, regardless of the party's good faith belief that the RINs were valid at the time they were acquired.
              (2) Upon determination by any party that RINs owned are invalid, the party must adjust their records, reports, and compliance calculations as necessary to reflect the deletion of the invalid RINs.
              (3) Any valid RINs remaining after deleting invalid RINs must first be applied to correct the transfer of invalid RINs to another party before applying the valid RINs to meet the party's Renewable Volume Obligation at the end of the compliance year.

              § 80.1132
              Reported spillage or disposal of renewable fuel.
              (a) A reported spillage or disposal under this subpart means a spillage or disposal of renewable fuel associated with a requirement by a federal, state or local authority to report the spillage or disposal.

              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in the event of a reported spillage or disposal of any volume of renewable fuel, the owner of the renewable fuel must retire a number of gallon-RINs corresponding to the volume of spilled or disposed of renewable fuel multiplied by the lesser of its equivalence value or the number of RINs received with the spilled or disposed fuel, not to exceed 2.5 RINs per gallon.
              
              (1) If the equivalence value for the spilled volume may be determined pursuant to § 80.1115 based on its composition, then the appropriate equivalence value shall be used.
              (2) If the equivalence value for a spilled volume of renewable fuel cannot be determined, the equivalence value shall be 1.0.
              (c) If the owner of a volume of renewable fuel that is spilled or disposed of and reported establishes that no RINs were generated to represent the volume, then no gallon-RINs shall be retired.
              (d) A RIN that is retired under paragraph (b) of this section:
              (1) Must be reported as a retired RIN in the applicable reports under § 80.1152.
              (2) May not be transferred to another party or used by any obligated party to demonstrate compliance with the party's Renewable Volume Obligation.

              § 80.1141
              Small refinery exemption.
              (a)(1) Gasoline produced at a refinery by a refiner, or foreign refiner (as defined at § 80.1165(a)), is exempt from the renewable fuel standards of § 80.1105 and the requirements that apply to obligated parties under this subpart if that refinery meets the definition of a small refinery under § 80.1101(g) for calendar year 2004.
              (2) This exemption shall apply through December 31, 2010, unless a refiner chooses to waive this exemption (as described in paragraph (f) of this section), or the exemption is extended (as described in paragraph (e) of this section).
              (3) For the purposes of this section, the term “refiner” shall include foreign refiners.
              (4) This exemption shall only apply to refineries that process crude oil, or feedstocks derived from crude oil, through refinery processing units.
              (b)(1) The small refinery exemption is effective immediately, except as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (2) A refiner owning a small refinery must submit a verification letter to EPA containing all of the following information:

The application must contain all of the elements required for small refinery verification letters (as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), must satisfy the provisions of § 80.1165(f) through (h) and (o), and must be submitted by August 31, 2007 to one of the addresses listed in paragraph (h) of this section.
              (c) If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information regarding a refinery's crude throughput (pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) in its small refinery verification letter, the exemption will be void as of the effective date of these regulations.
              (d) If a refiner is complying on an aggregate basis for multiple refineries, any such refiner may exclude from the calculation of its Renewable Volume Obligation (under § 80.1107(a)) gasoline from any refinery receiving the small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (e)(1) The exemption period in paragraph (a) of this section shall be extended by the Administrator for a period of not less than two additional years if a study by the Secretary of Energy determines that compliance with the requirements of this subpart would impose a disproportionate economic hardship on the small refinery.

              (i) A refiner may at any time petition the Administrator for an extension of its small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section for the reason of disproportionate economic hardship.
              (ii) A petition for an extension of the small refinery exemption must specify the factors that demonstrate a disproportionate economic hardship and must provide a detailed discussion regarding the inability of the refinery to produce gasoline meeting the requirements of § 80.1105 and the date the refiner anticipates that compliance with the requirements can be achieved at the small refinery.
              (2) The Administrator shall act on such a petition not later than 90 days after the date of receipt of the petition.

              (e) Bond posting. Any foreign entity shall meet the requirements of this paragraph (e) as a condition to approval as a foreign RIN owner under this subpart.
              

              (1) The foreign entity shall post a bond of the amount calculated using the following equation:
              
              Bond = G * $0.01
              
              
                Where:
                
                Bond = amount of the bond in U.S. dollars.
                G = The total of the number of gallon-RINs the foreign entity expects to sell or transfer during the first calendar year that the foreign entity is a RIN owner, plus the number of gallon-RINs the foreign entity expects to sell or transfer during the next four calendar years. After the first calendar year, the bond amount shall be based on the actual number of gallon-RINs sold or transferred during the current calendar year and the number held at the conclusion of the current averaging year, plus the number of gallon-RINs sold or transferred during the four most recent calendar years preceding the current calendar year. For any year for which there were fewer than four preceding years in which the foreign entity sold or transferred RINs, the bond shall be based on the total of the number of gallon-RINs sold or transferred during the current calendar year and the number held at the end of the current calendar year, plus the number of gallon-RINs sold or transferred during any calendar year preceding the current calendar year, plus the number of gallon-RINs expected to be sold or transferred during subsequent calendar years, the total number of years not to exceed four calendar years in addition to the current calendar year.
              
              
              (2) Bonds shall be posted by doing any of the following:
              (i) Paying the amount of the bond to the Treasurer of the United States.
              (ii) Obtaining a bond in the proper amount from a third party surety agent that is payable to satisfy United States administrative or judicial judgments against the foreign RIN owner, provided EPA agrees in advance as to the third party and the nature of the surety agreement.
              (iii) An alternative commitment that results in assets of an appropriate liquidity and value being readily available to the United States, provided EPA agrees in advance as to the alternative commitment.
              (3) Bonds posted under this paragraph (e) shall:
              (i) Be used to satisfy any judicial judgment that results from an administrative or judicial enforcement action for conduct in violation of this subpart, including where such conduct violates the False Statements Accountability Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 1001) and section 113(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7413);
              (ii) Be provided by a corporate surety that is listed in the United States Department of Treasury Circular 570 “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds”; and
              (iii) Include a commitment that the bond will remain in effect for at least five years following the end of latest reporting period in which the foreign RIN owner obtains, sells, transfers or holds RINs.
              (4) On any occasion a foreign RIN owner bond is used to satisfy any judgment, the foreign RIN owner shall increase the bond to cover the amount used within 90 days of the date the bond is used.
              (f) English language reports. Any document submitted to EPA by a foreign RIN owner shall be in English language, or shall include an English language translation.
              (g) Prohibitions. (1) A foreign RIN owner is prohibited from obtaining, selling, transferring or holding any RIN that is in excess of the number for which the bond requirements of this section have been satisfied.
              (2) Any RIN that is sold, transferred or held that is in excess of the number for which the bond requirements of this section have been satisfied is an invalid RIN under § 80.1131.
              (3) Any RIN that is obtained from a person located outside the United States that is not an approved foreign RIN owner under this section is an invalid RIN under § 80.1131.
              (4) No foreign RIN owner or other person may cause another person to commit an action prohibited in this paragraph (g), or that otherwise violates the requirements of this section.
              (h) Additional attest requirements for foreign RIN owners. The following additional requirements apply to any foreign RIN owner as part of the attest engagement required for RIN owners under this subpart K.

                (ii) The recordkeeping requirements for gasoline benzene credits under § 80.1350 are met.
                (iii) The gasoline benzene credits are correctly reported according to §§ 80.1352 and 80.1354.
                (iv) The conditions of this section are met.
                (2) Gasoline benzene credits generated under §§ 80.1275 and 80.1290 may be used interchangeably in all credit use scenarios, subject to the credit life provisions specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
                (3) Gasoline benzene credits may be used by a refiner or importer to comply with the gasoline benzene content standard of § 80.1230(a), may be banked by a refiner or importer for future use or transfer, may be transferred to another refinery or importer within a company (intracompany trading), or may be transferred to another refiner or importer outside of the company.
                (b) Credit transfers. (1) Gasoline benzene credits obtained from another refinery or importer may be used to comply with the gasoline benzene content requirement of § 80.1230(a) provided the following conditions are met:
                (i) The credits are generated and reported according to the requirements of this subpart, and the transferred credits have not expired, per paragraph (c) of this section.
                (ii) Any credit transfer takes place no later than March 31 following the calendar year averaging period when the credits are used.
                (iii) The credit has not been transferred more than twice. The first transfer by the refinery or importer that generated the credit may only be made to a refiner or importer that intends to use the credit; if the transferee cannot use the credit, it may make the second, and final, transfer only to a refiner or importer that intends to use or to terminate the credit. In no case may a credit be transferred more than twice before being used or terminated.
                (iv) The credit transferor has applied any gasoline benzene credits necessary to meet its own annual compliance requirements (including any deficit carried forward, pursuant to § 80.1230(c), if applicable) before transferring any gasoline benzene credits to any other refiner or importer.
                (v) The credit transferor does not create a deficit as a result of a credit transfer.

                (vi) The transferor supplies records to the transferee indicating the year the gasoline benzene credits were generated, the identity of the refiner (and refinery) or importer that generated the gasoline benzene credits, and the identity of the transferring entity if it is not the same entity that generated the gasoline benzene credits.
                (2) In the case of gasoline benzene credits that have been calculated or created improperly, or that EPA has otherwise determined to be invalid, the following provisions apply:
                (i) Invalid gasoline benzene credits cannot be used to achieve compliance with the gasoline benzene content requirement of § 80.1230(a), regardless of the transferee's good-faith belief that the gasoline benzene credits were valid.
                (ii) The refiner or importer that used the gasoline benzene credits and any transferor of the gasoline benzene credits must adjust their credit records, reports, and compliance calculations as necessary to reflect the proper gasoline benzene credits.
                (iii) Any properly created gasoline benzene credits existing in the transferor's credit balance following the corrections and adjustments specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section must first be applied to correct the invalid transfers to the transferee, before the transferor uses, trades or banks the gasoline benzene credits.
                (c) Credit life. (1)(i) Early credits, per § 80.1275, may be used for compliance purposes under § 80.1240(a) for any of the following annual averaging periods: 2011, 2102, 2013.
                (ii) Early credits, per § 80.1275, may be used for compliance purposes under § 80.1240(a) by small refiners approved under § 80.1340 for any of the following averaging periods: 2015, 2016, 2017.
                (2)(i) Standard credits, per § 80.1290, may be used for compliance purposes under § 80.1240(a) within five years from the year they were generated, except as noted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Example: Standard credits generated during 2011 may be used to achieve compliance under § 80.1240(a) for any calendar year averaging period prior to the 2017 averaging period.
                (ii) Standard credits, per § 80.1290, may be used for compliance purposes under § 80.1240(a) within seven years from the year they were generated if traded to and ultimately used by a small refiner approved under § 80.1340. Example: Standard credits generated in 2011 may be used to achieve compliance under § 80.1240(a) for any calendar year averaging period prior to the 2019 averaging period if traded to and ultimately used by a small refiner approved under § 80.1340.
                (d) Deficit provision limitation. A refiner or importer possessing gasoline benzene credits must use all gasoline benzene credits in its possession before applying the benzene deficit provisions of § 80.1230(c).

              Small Refiner Provisions
              
                § 80.1338
                What criteria must be met to qualify as a small refiner for the gasoline benzene requirements of this subpart?
                (a) A small refiner is any person that demonstrates that it—
                (1) Produced gasoline at a refinery by processing crude oil through refinery processing units from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005.
                (2) Employed an average of no more than 1,500 people, based on the average number of employees for all pay periods from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005.
                (3) Had a corporate average crude oil capacity less than or equal to 155,000 barrels per calendar day (bpcd) for 2005.
                (4) Following the submission of a small refiner application, pursuant to § 80.1340, has been approved as a small refiner for this subpart.
                (b) For the purpose of determining the number of employees and the crude oil capacity under paragraph (a) of this section, the following determinations shall be observed:

                (1) The refiner shall include the employees and crude oil capacity of any subsidiary companies, any parent company, subsidiaries of the parent company in which the parent has a controlling interest, and any joint venture partners.
                (2) For any refiner owned by a governmental entity, the number of employees and total crude oil capacity as specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall include all employees and crude oil production of the government to which the governmental entity is a part.
                (3) Any refiner owned and controlled by an Alaska Regional or Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601) is not considered an affiliate of such entity, or with other concerns owned by such entity, solely because of their common ownership.
                (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, a refiner that reactivates a refinery that it had previously operated, and that was shut down or non-operational for the entire period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2005, may apply for small refiner status in accordance with the provisions of § 80.1340.
              
              
                § 80.1339
                Who is not eligible for the provisions for small refiners?
                The following are not eligible for the hardship provisions for small refiners:
                (a) A refiner with one or more refineries built after December 31, 2005.
                (b) A refiner that exceeds the employee or crude oil capacity criteria under § 80.1338 but that meets these criteria after December 31, 2005, regardless of whether the reduction in employees or crude capacity is due to operational changes at the refinery or a company sale or reorganization.
                (c) Importers.
                (d) A refiner that produce gasoline other than by processing crude oil through refinery processing units.
                (e)(1) A small refiner approved under § 80.1340 that subsequently ceases production of gasoline from processing crude oil through refinery processing units, employs more than 1,500 people, or exceeds the 155,000 bpcd crude oil capacity limit after December 31, 2005 as a result of merger with or acquisition of or by another entity, is disqualified as a small refiner, except that this shall not apply in the case of a merger between two previously approved small refiners. If disqualification occurs, the refiner shall notify EPA in writing no later than 20 days following this disqualifying event.
                (2) Except as provided under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, any refiner whose status changes as specified in paragraph (e)(1) under this paragraph (b) shall meet the applicable standards of § 80.1230 within 30 months of the disqualifying event for all its refineries. However, such period shall not extend beyond December 31, 2014.
                (3) A refiner may apply to EPA for an additional six months to comply with the standards of § 80.1230 if it believes that more than 30 months will be required for the necessary engineering, permitting, construction, and start-up work to be completed. Such applications must include detailed technical information supporting the need for additional time. EPA will base its decision to approve additional time on the information provided by the refiner and on other relevant information. In no case will EPA extend the compliance date beyond December 31, 2014.
                (4) During the period provided under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and any extension provided under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the refiner may not generate gasoline benzene credits under § 80.1275(b)(3) for any of its refineries where under § 80.1342 the refiner was previously allowed to defer compliance with the standards in §§ 80.1230(a) and 80.1230(b).
                (f) A small refiner approved under § 80.1340 which notifies EPA that it wishes to withdraw its small refiner status pursuant to § 80.1340(g).

                What are the sampling and testing requirements for refiners and importers?
                (a) Sample and test each batch of gasoline. (1) The sampling and testing requirements specified in subpart D for reformulated gasoline shall continue to apply to reformulated gasoline and shall be extended to conventional gasoline (CG) for the purpose of complying with the benzene requirements of this subpart, except as modified by paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section.
                (2) Refiners and importers shall collect a representative sample from each batch of gasoline produced or imported, according to the earliest applicable date in the following schedule:
                (i) Beginning January 1, 2011;
                (ii) Beginning January 1, 2015 for small refiners approved under § 80.1340;
                (iii) Beginning January 1 of the year prior to 2015 in which a small refiner approved under § 80.1340 has opted, per § 80.1342(a), to begin meeting the standards at § 80.1230;
                (iv) Beginning June 1, 2007, for any refinery planning to generate early credits for the averaging period specified at § 80.1275(b)(1);
                (v) Beginning January 1 of each averaging period specified at § 80.1275(b)(2) or (b)(3) for which the refinery plans to generate early credits;
                (vi) Beginning January 1 of the year, per § 80.1334(c)(1), in which a refinery approved for early compliance under § 80.1334 opts to begin early compliance. The provisions shall only apply to the type of gasoline, RFG or CG, for which early compliance was approved.
                (3)(i) Each sample shall be tested in accordance with the methodology specified at § 80.46(e) through December 31, 2015, to determine its benzene concentration for compliance with the requirements of this subpart. Beginning January 1, 2016, each sample shall be tested in accordance with the methodology specified at § 80.47 to determine its benzene concentration for compliance with the requirements of this subpart. Any negative test result must be reported as zero.
                (ii) Independent sample analysis, under § 80.65(f), is not required for conventional gasoline.
                (4) Any refiner or importer may release CG prior to obtaining the test results for benzene required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
                (5) Previously certified gasoline (PCG) may be excluded as follows:
                (i) Any refiner who uses PCG to produce gasoline at a refinery, must exclude the PCG for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the benzene standards at § 80.1230.
                (ii) To accomplish the exclusion required in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the refiner must determine the volume and benzene content of the PCG used at the refinery and the volume and benzene content of gasoline produced at the refinery, and use the compliance calculation procedures in paragraphs (a)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
                (iii) For each batch of PCG that is used to produce gasoline the refiner must include the volume and benzene content of the PCG as a negative volume and a positive benzene content in the refiner's compliance calculations in accordance with the requirements at § 80.1238.
                (iv) For each batch of gasoline produced at the refinery using PCG and blendstock, the refiner must determine the volume and benzene content of the combined product and include each batch for purposes of benzene compliance in the refinery's compliance calculations at § 80.1240 without regard to the presence of previously certified gasoline in the batch.
                (v) The refiner must use any PCG that it includes as a negative batch in its compliance calculations pursuant to § 80.1240 as a component in gasoline production during the annual averaging period in which the PCG was included as a negative batch in the refiner's compliance calculations.
                (vi) Any negative annual average value must be reported as zero.
                (vii) The refiner must also comply with § 80.65(i) when producing RBOB or RFG and § 80.101(g)(9) when producing conventional gasoline.
                (6) As an alternative to the sampling and testing requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a refiner who produces gasoline by blending one or more blendstocks into PCG may sample and test each batch of blendstock when received at the refinery to determine the volume and benzene content, and treat each blendstock receipt as a separate batch for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the benzene standards in § 80.1230, and for benzene reporting.
                (b) Batch numbering. The batch numbering convention of § 80.365(b) shall apply to batches of conventional gasoline beginning with earliest applicable date specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

              Foreign Refiners
              
                § 80.1363
                What are the additional requirements under this subpart for gasoline produced at foreign refineries?
                (a) Definitions. (1) A foreign refinery is a refinery that is located outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively referred to in this section as “the United States”).
                (2) A foreign refiner is a person that meets the definition of refiner under § 80.2(i) for a foreign refinery.
                (3) Benzene-FRGAS means gasoline produced at a foreign refinery that has been assigned an individual refinery benzene baseline under § 80.1285, has been approved as a small refiner under § 80.1340, or has been granted temporary relief under § 80.1335, and that is imported into the United States.
                (4) Non-Benzene-FRGAS means
                (i) Gasoline meeting any of the conditions specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section that is not imported into the United States.
                (ii) Gasoline meeting any of the conditions specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section during a year when the foreign refiner has opted to not participate in the Benzene-FRGAS program under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
                (iii) Gasoline produced at a foreign refinery that has not been assigned an individual refinery benzene baseline under § 80.1285, or that has not been approved as a small refiner under § 80.1340, or that has not been granted temporary relief under § 80.1335.
                (5) Certified Benzene-FRGAS means Benzene-FRGAS the foreign refiner intends to include in the foreign refinery's benzene compliance calculations under § 80.1240 or credit calculations under § 80.1275 and does include in these calculations when reported to EPA.
                (6) Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS means Benzene-FRGAS that is not Certified Benzene-FRGAS.
                (b) Baseline for Early Credits. For any foreign refiner to obtain approval under the benzene foreign refiner program of this subpart for any refinery in order to generate early credits under § 80.1275, it must apply for approval under the applicable provisions of this subpart.
                (1) The refiner shall follow the procedures specified in §§ 80.1280 and 80.1285 to establish a baseline of the volume of gasoline that was produced at the refinery and imported into the United States during the applicable years.

                (2) In making determinations for foreign refinery baselines EPA will consider all information supplied by a foreign refiner, and in addition may rely on any and all appropriate assumptions necessary to make such determinations.
                
                (3) Where a foreign refiner submits a petition that is incomplete or inadequate to establish an accurate baseline, and the refiner fails to correct this deficiency after a request for more information, EPA will not assign an individual refinery baseline.
                (c) General requirements for Benzene-FRGAS foreign refiners. A foreign refiner of a refinery that is approved under the benzene foreign refiner program of this subpart must designate each batch of gasoline produced at the foreign refinery that is exported to the United States as either Certified Benzene-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
                (1) In the case of Certified Benzene-FRGAS, the foreign refiner must meet all requirements that apply to refiners under this subpart.
                (2) In the case of Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS, the foreign refiner shall meet all the following requirements:

                (vi) The independent audit requirements in this section and in § 80.1356.
                (3)(i) Any foreign refiner that generates early benzene credits under § 80.1275 shall designate all Benzene-FRGAS as Certified Benzene-FRGAS for any year that such credits are generated.
                (ii) Any foreign refiner that has been approved to produce gasoline subject to the benzene foreign refiner program for a foreign refinery under this subpart may elect to classify no gasoline imported into the United States as Benzene-FRGAS provided the foreign refiner notifies EPA of the election no later than November 1 preceding the beginning of the next compliance period.
                (iii) An election under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section shall be for a 12 month compliance period and apply to all gasoline that is produced by the foreign refinery that is imported into the United States, and shall remain in effect for each succeeding year unless and until the foreign refiner notifies EPA of the termination of the election. The change in election shall take effect at the beginning of the next annual compliance period.
                (d) Designation, product transfer documents, and foreign refiner certification. (1) Any foreign refiner of a foreign refinery that has been approved by EPA to produce gasoline subject to the benzene foreign refiner program must designate each batch of Benzene-FRGAS as such at the time the gasoline is produced, unless the refiner has elected to classify no gasoline exported to the United States as Benzene-FRGAS under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
                (2) On each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to any Benzene-FRGAS prior to its being imported into the United States, it must include the following information as part of the product transfer document information:

                (ii) The name and EPA refinery registration number of the refinery where the Benzene-FRGAS was produced.
                (3) On each occasion when Benzene-FRGAS is loaded onto a vessel or other transportation mode for transport to the United States, the foreign refiner shall prepare a certification for each batch of the Benzene-FRGAS that meets the following requirements.
                (i) The certification shall include the report of the independent third party under paragraph (f) of this section, and the following additional information:
                (A) The name and EPA registration number of the refinery that produced the Benzene-FRGAS;
                (B) The identification of the gasoline as Certified Benzene-FRGAS or Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS;
                (C) The volume of Benzene-FRGAS being transported, in gallons;
                (D) In the case of Certified Benzene-FRGAS:
                (1) The benzene content as determined under paragraph (f) of this section, and the applicable designations stated in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; and
                
                (2) A declaration that the Benzene-FRGAS is being included in the applicable compliance calculations required by EPA under this subpart.
                (ii) The certification shall be made part of the product transfer documents for the Benzene-FRGAS.
                (e) Transfers of Benzene-FRGAS to non-United States markets. The foreign refiner is responsible to ensure that all gasoline classified as Benzene-FRGAS is imported into the United States. A foreign refiner may remove the Benzene-FRGAS classification, and the gasoline need not be imported into the United States, but only if:
                (1) The foreign refiner excludes:
                (i) The volume of gasoline from the refinery's compliance report under § 80.1354; and

                (i) Be used to satisfy any judicial judgment that results from an administrative or judicial enforcement action for conduct in violation of this subpart, including where such conduct violates the False Statements Accountability Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 1001) and section 113(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7413);
                (ii) Be provided by a corporate surety that is listed in the United States Department of Treasury Circular 570 “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds”; and
                (iii) Include a commitment that the bond will remain in effect for at least five years following the end of latest annual reporting period that the foreign refiner produces gasoline pursuant to the requirements of this subpart.
                (4) On any occasion a foreign refiner bond is used to satisfy any judgment, the foreign refiner shall increase the bond to cover the amount used within 90 days of the date the bond is used.
                (5) If the bond amount for a foreign refiner increases, the foreign refiner shall increase the bond to cover the shortfall within 90 days of the date the bond amount changes. If the bond amount decreases, the foreign refiner may reduce the amount of the bond beginning 90 days after the date the bond amount changes.
                (l) [Reserved]
                (m) English language reports. Any report or other document submitted to EPA by a foreign refiner shall be in English language, or shall include an English language translation.

(1) No person may combine Certified Benzene-FRGAS with any Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS or Non-Benzene-FRGAS, and no person may combine Certified Benzene-FRGAS with any Certified Benzene-FRGAS produced at a different refinery, until the importer has met all the requirements of paragraph (o) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
                
                (2) No foreign refiner or other person may cause another person to commit an action prohibited in paragraph (n)(1) of this section, or that otherwise violates the requirements of this section.
                (o) United States importer requirements. Any United States importer shall meet the following requirements:
                (1) Each batch of imported gasoline shall be classified by the importer as being Benzene-FRGAS or as Non-Benzene-FRGAS, and each batch classified as Benzene-FRGAS shall be further classified as Certified Benzene-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS.
                (2) Gasoline shall be classified as Certified Benzene-FRGAS or as Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS according to the designation by the foreign refiner if this designation is supported by product transfer documents prepared by the foreign refiner as required in paragraph (d) of this section, unless the gasoline is classified as Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS under paragraph (g) of this section. Additionally, the importer shall comply with all requirements of this subpart applicable to importers.
                (3) For each gasoline batch classified as Benzene-FRGAS, any United States importer shall perform the following procedures.
                (i) In the case of both Certified and Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS, have an independent third party:
                (A) Determine the volume of gasoline in the vessel;
                (B) Use the foreign refiner's Benzene-FRGAS certification to determine the name and EPA-assigned registration number of the foreign refinery that produced the Benzene-FRGAS;
                (C) Determine the name and country of registration of the vessel used to transport the Benzene-FRGAS to the United States; and
                (D) Determine the date and time the vessel arrives at the United States port of entry.
                (ii) In the case of Certified Benzene-FRGAS, have an independent third party:
                (A) Collect a representative sample from each vessel compartment subsequent to the vessel's arrival at the United States port of entry and prior to off loading any gasoline from the vessel;
                (B) Obtain the compartment samples; and
                (C) Determine the benzene content value of each compartment sample using the methodology specified at § 80.46(e) by the third party analyzing the sample or by the third party observing the importer analyze the sample.
                (4) Any importer shall submit reports within 30 days following the date any vessel transporting Benzene-FRGAS arrives at the United States port of entry:
                (i) To the Administrator containing the information determined under paragraph (o)(3) of this section; and
                (ii) To the foreign refiner containing the information determined under paragraph (o)(3)(ii) of this section, and including identification of the port at which the product was offloaded.
                (5) Any United States importer shall meet all other requirements of this subpart for any imported gasoline that is not classified as Certified Benzene-FRGAS under paragraph (o)(2) of this section.
                (p) Truck imports of Certified Benzene-FRGAS produced at a foreign refinery. (1) Any refiner whose Certified Benzene-FRGAS is transported into the United States by truck may petition EPA to use alternative procedures to meet the following requirements:
                (i) Certification under paragraph (d)(5) of this section;

                (iv) Importer testing under paragraph (o)(3) of this section.
                (2) These alternative procedures must ensure Certified Benzene-FRGAS remains segregated from Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS and from Non-Benzene-FRGAS until it is imported into the United States. The petition will be evaluated based on whether it adequately addresses the following:
                (i) Provisions for monitoring pipeline shipments, if applicable, from the refinery, that ensure segregation of Certified Benzene-FRGAS from that refinery from all other gasoline;

                (ii) Contracts with any terminals and/or pipelines that receive and/or transport Certified Benzene-FRGAS, that prohibit the commingling of Certified Benzene-FRGAS with any of the following:
                (A) Other Certified Benzene-FRGAS from other refineries.
                (B) All Non-Certified Benzene-FRGAS.
                (C) All Non-Benzene-FRGAS;
                (iii) Procedures for obtaining and reviewing truck loading records and United States import documents for Certified Benzene-FRGAS to ensure that such gasoline is only loaded into trucks making deliveries to the United States;
                (iv) Attest procedures to be conducted annually by an independent third party that review loading records and import documents based on volume reconciliation, or other criteria, to confirm that all Certified Benzene-FRGAS remains segregated throughout the distribution system and is only loaded into trucks for import into the United States.
                (3) The petition required by this section must be submitted to EPA along with the application for temporary refiner relief individual refinery benzene standard under this subpart.
                (q) Withdrawal or suspension of foreign refiner status. EPA may withdraw or suspend a foreign refiner's benzene baseline or standard approval for a foreign refinery where—
                (1) A foreign refiner fails to meet any requirement of this section;
                (2) A foreign government fails to allow EPA inspections as provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section;
                (3) A foreign refiner asserts a claim of, or a right to claim, sovereign immunity in an action to enforce the requirements in this subpart; or
                (4) A foreign refiner fails to pay a civil or criminal penalty that is not satisfied using the foreign refiner bond specified in paragraph (k) of this section.
                (r) Early use of a foreign refiner benzene baseline. (1) A foreign refiner may begin using an individual refinery benzene baseline under this subpart before EPA has approved the baseline, provided that:
                (i) A baseline petition has been submitted as required in paragraph (b) of this section;
                (ii) EPA has made a provisional finding that the baseline petition is complete;

                (v) The foreign refiner has met the bond requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.

                (2) In any case where a foreign refiner uses an individual refinery baseline before final approval under paragraph (r)(1) of this section, and the foreign refinery baseline values that ultimately are approved by EPA are more stringent than the early baseline values used by the foreign refiner, the foreign refiner shall recalculate its compliance, ab initio, using the baseline values approved by the EPA, and the foreign refiner shall be liable for any resulting violation of the requirements of this subpart.
                (s) Additional requirements for petitions, reports and certificates. Any petition for approval to produce gasoline subject to the benzene foreign refiner program, any alternative procedures under paragraph (p) of this section, any report or other submission required by paragraph (c), (f)(2), or (i) of this section, and any certification under paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall be—
                (1) Submitted in accordance with procedures specified by the Administrator, including use of any forms that may be specified by the Administrator.

                (2) Be signed by the president or owner of the foreign refiner company, or by that person's immediate designee, and shall contain the following declaration:

              (a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
              (1) Commence construction, as applied to facilities that produce renewable fuel, means that:
              (i) The owner or operator has all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits (as defined at 40 CFR 52.21(b)(10)), and has satisfied either of the following:
              (A) Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual construction on-site (as defined in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(11)).
              (B) Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the facility.
              (ii) For multi-phased projects, the commencement of construction of one phase does not constitute commencement of construction of any later phase, unless each phase is mutually dependent for physical and chemical reasons only.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (b) The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuels must be at least 20 percent less than baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, with the exception of the baseline volumes of renewable fuel produced from facilities described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
              (c) The baseline volume of renewable fuel that is produced from facilities and any expansions, all of which commenced construction on or before December 19, 2007, shall not be subject to the requirement that lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions be at least 20 percent less than baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions if the owner or operator:
              (1) Did not discontinue construction for a period of 18 months after commencement of construction; and
              (2) Completed construction by December 19, 2010.
              (d) The baseline volume of ethanol that is produced from facilities and any expansions all of which commenced construction after December 19, 2007 and on or before December 31, 2009, shall not be subject to the requirement that lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions be at least 20 percent less than baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions if such facilities are fired with natural gas, biomass, or a combination thereof at all times the facility operated between December 19, 2007 and December 31, 2009 and if:
              (1) The owner or operator did not discontinue construction for a period of 18 months after commencement of construction;
              (2) The owner or operator completed construction within 36 months of commencement of construction; and
              (3) The baseline volume continues to be produced through processes fired with natural gas, biomass, or any combination thereof.
              (e) The annual volume of renewable fuel during a calendar year from facilities described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section that exceeds the baseline volume shall be subject to the requirement that lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions be at least 20 percent less than baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.
              (f) If there are any changes in the mix of renewable fuels produced by those facilities described in paragraph (d) of this section, only the ethanol volume (to the extent it is less than or equal to baseline volume) will not be subject to the requirement that lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions be at least 20 percent less than baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Any party that changes the fuel mix must update their registration as specified in § 80.1450(d).

              Who is an obligated party under the RFS program?
              (a)(1) An obligated party is any refiner that produces gasoline or diesel fuel within the 48 contiguous states or Hawaii, or any importer that imports gasoline or diesel fuel into the 48 contiguous states or Hawaii during a compliance period. A party that simply blends renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel fuel, as defined in § 80.1407(c) or (e), is not an obligated party.
              (2) If the Administrator approves a petition of Alaska or a United States territory to opt-in to the renewable fuel program under the provisions in § 80.1443, then “obligated party” shall also include any refiner that produces gasoline or diesel fuel within that state or territory, or any importer that imports gasoline or diesel fuel into that state or territory.
              (b) For each compliance period starting with 2010, an obligated party is required to demonstrate, pursuant to § 80.1427, that it has satisfied the Renewable Volume Obligations for that compliance period, as specified in § 80.1407(a).
              (c) Aggregation of facilities—(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2), (d) and (e) of this section, an obligated party may comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section in the aggregate for all of the refineries that it operates, or for each refinery individually.
              (2) An obligated party that carries a deficit into year i + 1 must use the same approach to aggregation of facilities in year i + 1 as it did in year i.
              (d) An obligated party must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for all of its imported gasoline or diesel fuel in the aggregate.
              (e) An obligated party that is both a refiner and importer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for its imported gasoline or diesel fuel separately from gasoline or diesel fuel produced by its domestic refinery or refineries.
              (f) Where a refinery or import facility is jointly owned by two or more parties, the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section may be met by one of the joint owners for all of the gasoline or diesel fuel produced/imported at the facility, or each party may meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for the portion of the gasoline or diesel fuel that it produces or imports, as long as all of the gasoline or diesel fuel produced/imported at the facility is accounted for in determining the Renewable Volume Obligations under § 80.1407. In either case, all joint owners are subject to the liability provisions of § 80.1461(d).
              (g) The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section apply to the following compliance periods: Beginning in 2010, and every year thereafter, the compliance period is January 1 through December 31.

              § 80.1415
              How are equivalence values assigned to renewable fuel?

              (a)(1) Each gallon of a renewable fuel, or gallon equivalent pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this section, shall be assigned an equivalence value by the producer or importer pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
              
              (2) The equivalence value is a number that is used to determine how many gallon-RINs can be generated for a gallon of renewable fuel according to § 80.1426.
              (b) Equivalence values shall be assigned for certain renewable fuels as follows:
              (1) Ethanol which is denatured shall have an equivalence value of 1.0.
              (2) Biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) shall have an equivalence value of 1.5.
              (3) Butanol shall have an equivalence value of 1.3.
              (4) Non-ester renewable diesel with a lower heating value of at least 123,500 Btu/gal shall have an equivalence value of 1.7.
              (5) 77,000 Btu (lower heating value) of compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) shall represent one gallon of renewable fuel with an equivalence value of 1.0.
              (6) 22.6 kW-hr of electricity shall represent one gallon of renewable fuel with an equivalence value of 1.0.
              (7) For all other renewable fuels, a producer or importer shall submit an application to the Agency for an equivalence value following the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. A producer or importer may also submit an application for an alternative equivalence value pursuant to paragraph (c) if the renewable fuel is listed in this paragraph (b), but the producer or importer has reason to believe that a different equivalence value than that listed in this paragraph (b) is warranted.
              (c) Calculation of new equivalence values. (1) The equivalence value for renewable fuels described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be calculated using the following formula:
              
              EV = (R/0.972) * (EC/77,000)
              
              
                Where:
                
                EV = Equivalence Value for the renewable fuel, rounded to the nearest tenth.
                R = Renewable content of the renewable fuel. This is a measure of the portion of a renewable fuel that came from renewable biomass, expressed as a fraction, on an energy basis.
                EC = Energy content of the renewable fuel, in Btu per gallon (lower heating value).
              
              
              (2) The application for an equivalence value shall include a technical justification that includes all the following:
              (i) A calculation for the requested equivalence value according to the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including supporting documentation for the value of EC used in the calculation such as a certificate of analysis from a laboratory that verifies the lower heating value in Btu per gallon of the renewable fuel produced.
              (ii) For each feedstock, component, or additive that is used to make the renewable fuel, provide a description, the percent input, and identify whether or not it is renewable biomass or is derived from renewable biomass.
              (iii) For each feedstock that also qualifies as a renewable fuel, state whether or not RINs have been previously generated for such feedstock.
              (iv) A description of the renewable fuel and the production process, including a block diagram that shows all inputs and outputs at each step of the production process with a sample quantity of all inputs and outputs for one batch of renewable fuel produced.
              (3) The Agency will review the technical justification and assign an appropriate equivalence value to the renewable fuel based on the procedure in this paragraph (c).
              (4) Applications for equivalence values must be sent to one of the following addresses:
              (i) For U.S. Mail: U.S. EPA, Attn: RFS2 Program Equivalence Value Application, 6406J, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460.

              (iv) The renewable fuel is designated on a product transfer document (PTD) for use as transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel in accordance with § 80.1453(a)(12).

              (2) To generate RINs for imported renewable fuel, including any renewable fuel contained in imported transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel, importers must obtain information from a foreign producer that is registered pursuant to § 80.1450 sufficient to make the appropriate determination regarding the applicable D code and compliance with the renewable biomass definition for each imported batch for which RINs are generated.
              (3) A party generating a RIN shall specify the appropriate numerical values for each component of the RIN in accordance with the provisions of § 80.1425(a) and paragraph (f) of this section.
              (b) Regional applicability. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a RIN must be generated by a renewable fuel producer or importer for a batch of renewable fuel that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it is produced or imported for use as transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel in the 48 contiguous states or Hawaii.
              (2) If the Administrator approves a petition of Alaska or a United States territory to opt-in to the renewable fuel program under the provisions in § 80.1443, then the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall also apply to renewable fuel produced or imported for use as transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel in that state or territory beginning in the next calendar year.
              (c) Cases in which RINs are not generated.(1) Fuel producers and importers may not generate RINs for fuel that does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (2) Small producer/importer threshold. Pursuant to § 80.1455(a) and (b), renewable fuel producers that produce less than 10,000 gallons a year of renewable fuel, and importers that import less than 10,000 gallons a year of renewable fuel, are not required to generate and assign RINs to batches of renewable fuel that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section that they produce or import.
              (3) Temporary new producer threshold. Pursuant to § 80.1455(c) and (d), new renewable fuel producers that produce less than 125,000 gallons of renewable fuel a year are not required to generate and assign RINs to batches of renewable fuel to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
              (i) The provisions of this paragraph (c)(3) apply only to new facilities, for a maximum of three years beginning with the calendar year in which the production facility produces its first gallon of renewable fuel.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (4) Importers shall not generate RINs for renewable fuel imported from a foreign renewable fuel producer, or for renewable fuel made with ethanol produced by a foreign ethanol producer, unless the foreign renewable fuel producer or foreign ethanol producer is registered with EPA as required in § 80.1450.
              (5) Importers shall not generate RINs for renewable fuel that has already been assigned RINs by a registered foreign producer.
              (6) A party is prohibited from generating RINs for a volume of fuel that it produces if the fuel has been produced by a process that uses a renewable fuel as a feedstock, and the renewable fuel that is used as a feedstock was produced by another party, except that RINs may be generated for such fuel if allowed by the EPA in response to a petition submitted pursuant to § 80.1416 and the petition approval specifies a mechanism to prevent double counting of RINs.

              (7) For renewable fuel oil that is heating oil as defined in paragraph (2) of the definition of heating oil in § 80.1401, renewable fuel producers and importers shall not generate RINs unless they have received affidavits from the final end user or users of the fuel oil as specified in § 80.1451(b)(1)(ii)(T)(2).
              (d)(1) Definition of batch. For the purposes of this section and § 80.1425, a “batch of renewable fuel” is a volume of renewable fuel that has been assigned a unique identifier within a calendar year by the producer or importer of the renewable fuel in accordance with the provisions of this section and § 80.1425.
              (i) The number of gallon-RINs generated for a batch of renewable fuel may not exceed 99,999,999.

              (ii) A batch of renewable fuel cannot represent renewable fuel produced or imported in excess of one calendar month.
              
              (2) Multiple gallon-RINs generated to represent a given volume of renewable fuel can be represented by a single batch-RIN through the appropriate designation of the RIN volume codes SSSSSSSS and EEEEEEEE.
              (i) The value of SSSSSSSS in the batch-RIN shall be 00000001 to represent the first gallon-RIN associated with the volume of renewable fuel.

              (ii) The value of EEEEEEEE in the batch-RIN shall represent the last gallon-RIN associated with the volume of renewable fuel, based on the RIN volume VRIN determined pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.
              (iii) Under § 80.1452, RIN volumes will be managed by EMTS. RIN codes SSSSSSSS and EEEEEEEE do not have a role in EMTS.
              (e) Assignment of RINs to batches—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section for delayed RINs, the producer or importer of renewable fuel must assign all RINs generated to volumes of renewable fuel.
              (2) A RIN is assigned to a volume of renewable fuel when ownership of the RIN is transferred along with the transfer of ownership of the volume of renewable fuel, pursuant to § 80.1428(a).
              (3) All assigned RINs shall have a K code value of 1.

              (7) Biomass-based diesel in 2010.
              

              (i) Prior to determining compliance with the 2010 biomass-based diesel RVO, obligated parties may reduce the value of RVOBBD,2010 by an amount equal to the sum of all 2008 and 2009 RINs that they used for compliance purposes for calendar year 2009 which have a D code of 2 and an RR code of 15, 16, or 17.

              (ii) For calendar year 2010 only, the following equation shall be used to determine compliance with the biomass-based diesel RVO instead of the equation in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section
              
              (ΣRINNUM)BBD,2010 + (ΣRINNUM)BBD,2009 + (ΣRINNUM)BBD,2008 = RVOBBD,2010
              
              
              
                Where
                
                (ΣRINNUM)BBD,2010 = Sum of all owned gallon-RINs that are valid for use in complying with the biomass-based diesel RVO, were generated in year 2010, and are being applied towards the RVOBBD,2010, in gallons.
                (ΣRINNUM)BBD,2009 = Sum of all owned gallon-RINs that are valid for use in complying with the biomass-based diesel RVO, were generated in year 2009, have not previously been used for compliance purposes, and are being applied towards the RVOBBD,2010, in gallons.
                (ΣRINNUM)BBD,2008 = Sum of all owned gallon-RINs that are valid for use in complying with the biomass-based diesel RVO, were generated in year 2008, have not previously been used for compliance purposes, and are being applied towards the RVOBBD,2010, in gallons.
                RVOBBD,2010 = The Renewable Volume Obligation for biomass-based diesel for the obligated party for calendar year 2010, in gallons, pursuant to § 80.1407 or § 80.1430, as adjusted by paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section.
              
              
              (iii) The values of (ΣRINNUM)2008 and (ΣRINNUM)2009 may not exceed values determined by both of the following inequalities
              
              (ΣRINNUM)BBD,2008 ≤0.087 * RVOBBD,2010

              (8) A party may only use a RIN for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(7) of this section if that RIN is a separated RIN with a K code of 2 obtained in accordance with §§ 80.1428 and 80.1429.

              (9) The number of gallon-RINs associated with a given batch-RIN that can be used for compliance with the RVOs shall be calculated from the following formula:
              
              RINNUM = EEEEEEEE − SSSSSSSS + 1
              
              
                Where:
                
                RINNUM = Number of gallon-RINs associated with a batch-RIN, where each gallon-RIN represents one gallon of renewable fuel for compliance purposes.
                EEEEEEEE = Batch-RIN component identifying the last gallon-RIN associated with the batch-RIN.
                SSSSSSSS = Batch-RIN component identifying the first gallon-RIN associated with the batch-RIN.
              
              
              (b) Deficit carryovers. (1) An obligated party that fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(7) of this section for calendar year i is permitted to carry a deficit into year i + 1 under the following conditions:
              (i) The party did not carry a deficit into calendar year i from calendar year i-1 for the same RVO.

              (ii) The party subsequently meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section for calendar year i + 1 and carries no deficit into year i + 2 for the same RVO.
              
              (iii) For compliance with the biomass-based diesel RVO in calendar year 2011, the deficit which is carried over from 2010 is no larger than 57% of the party's 2010 biomass-based diesel RVO as determined prior to any adjustment applied pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section.
              (iv) The party uses the same compliance approach in year i + 1 as it did in year i, as provided in § 80.1406(c)(2).

              (2) A deficit is calculated according to the following formula:
              
              Di = RVOi − [(ΣRINNUM)i + (ΣRINNUM)i-1]
              
              
                Where:
                
                Di = The deficit, in gallons, generated in calendar year i that must be carried over to year i + 1 if allowed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
                RVOi = The Renewable Volume Obligation for the obligated party or renewable fuel exporter for calendar year i, in gallons.
                (ΣRINNUM)i = Sum of all acquired gallon-RINs that were generated in year i and are being applied towards the RVOi, in gallons.
                (ΣRINNUM)i-1 = Sum of all acquired gallon-RINs that were generated in year i-1 and are being applied towards the RVOi, in gallons.
              
              (c) Exporter Renewable Volume Obligations (ERVOs). (1) Each exporter of renewable fuel that is obligated to meet Exporter Renewable Volume Obligations under § 80.1430 must demonstrate pursuant to § 80.1451(a)(1) that is has retired for compliance purposes a sufficient number of RINs to meet its ERVOs by the deadline specified in § 80.1430(f).
              (2) In fulfillment of its ERVOs, each exporter is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(6), and (a)(8) of this section.
              (3) No more than 20 percent of the ERVO calculated according to a formula at § 80.1430(b) may be fulfilled using RINs generated in the year prior to the year in which the RVO was incurred.

              (2) Except as provided in § 80.1429, no person can separate a RIN that has been assigned to a batch pursuant to § 80.1426(e).
              (3) An assigned RIN cannot be transferred to another person without simultaneously transferring a volume of renewable fuel to that same person.
              (4) No more than 2.5 assigned gallon-RINs with a K code of 1 can be transferred to another person with every gallon of renewable fuel transferred to that same person.

              (5)(i) On each of the dates listed in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section in any calendar year, the following equation must be satisfied for assigned RINs and volumes of renewable fuel owned by a person:
              
              Σ(RIN)D ≤Σ(Vsi * 2.5)D
              
              
              
                Where:
                
                D = Applicable date.
                Σ(RIN)D = Sum of all assigned gallon-RINs with a K code of 1 that are owned on date D.

              (ii) The applicable dates are March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.
              (6) Any transfer of ownership of assigned RINs must be documented on product transfer documents generated pursuant to § 80.1453.
              (i) The RIN must be recorded on the product transfer document used to transfer ownership of the volume of renewable fuel to another person; or
              (ii) The RIN must be recorded on a separate product transfer document transferred to the same person on the same day as the product transfer document used to transfer ownership of the volume of renewable fuel.
              (b) RINs separated from volumes of renewable fuel—(1) Separated RIN, for the purposes of this subpart, means a RIN with a K code of 2 that has been separated from a volume of renewable fuel pursuant to § 80.1429.
              (2) Any person that has registered pursuant to § 80.1450 can own a separated RIN.

              (3) Separated RINs can be transferred any number of times.
              
              (c) RIN expiration. Except as provided in § 80.1427(a)(7), a RIN is valid for compliance during the calendar year in which it was generated, or the following calendar year. Any RIN that is not used for compliance purposes for the calendar year in which it was generated, or for the following calendar year, will be considered an expired RIN. Pursuant to § 80.1431(a), an expired RIN will be considered an invalid RIN and cannot be used for compliance purposes.
              (d) Any batch-RIN can be divided into multiple batch-RINs, each representing a smaller number of gallon-RINs, if all of the following conditions are met:
              (1) All RIN components other than SSSSSSSS and EEEEEEEE are identical for the original parent and newly formed daughter RINs.
              (2) The sum of the gallon-RINs associated with the multiple daughter batch-RINs is equal to the gallon-RINs associated with the parent batch-RIN.

              (b) A RIN that is assigned to a volume of renewable fuel can be separated from that volume only under one of the following conditions:
              (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(9) of this section, a party that is an obligated party according to § 80.1406 must separate any RINs that have been assigned to a volume of renewable fuel if that party owns that volume.
              (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, any party that owns a volume of renewable fuel must separate any RINs that have been assigned to that volume once the volume is blended with gasoline or fossil-based diesel to produce a transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel. A party may separate up to 2.5 RINs per gallon of blended renewable fuel.
              (3) Any party that exports a volume of renewable fuel must separate any RINs that have been assigned to the exported volume. A party may separate up to 2.5 RINs per gallon of exported renewable fuel.
              (4) Any party that produces, imports, owns, sells, or uses a volume of neat renewable fuel, or a blend of renewable fuel and diesel fuel, must separate any RINs that have been assigned to that volume of neat renewable fuel or that blend if:
              (i) The party designates the neat renewable fuel or blend as transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel; and
              (ii) The neat renewable fuel or blend is used without further blending, in the designated form, as transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel.
              (5) Any party that produces, imports, owns, sells, or uses a volume of electricity or biogas for which RINs have been generated in accordance with § 80.1426(f) must separate any RINs that have been assigned to that volume of renewable electricity or biogas if:
              (i) The party designates the electricity or biogas as transportation fuel; and
              (ii) The electricity or biogas is used as transportation fuel.
              (6) RINs assigned to a volume of biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) can only be separated from that volume pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section if such biodiesel is blended into diesel fuel at a concentration of 80 volume percent biodiesel (mono-alkyl ester) or less.

              (10) Any party that produces a volume of renewable fuel may separate any RINs that have been generated to represent that volume of renewable fuel or that blend if that party retires the separated RINs to replace invalid RINs according to § 80.1474.
              (c) The party responsible for separating a RIN from a volume of renewable fuel shall change the K code in the RIN from a value of 1 to a value of 2 prior to transferring the RIN to any other party.
              (d) Upon and after separation of a RIN from its associated volume of renewable fuel, the separated RIN must be accompanied by a PTD pursuant to § 80.1453 when transferred to another party.
              (e) Upon and after separation of a RIN from its associated volume of renewable fuel, product transfer documents used to transfer ownership of the volume must meet the requirements of § 80.1453.
              (f) [Reserved]
              (g) Any 2009 or 2010 RINs retired pursuant to § 80.1129 because renewable fuel was used in a nonroad vehicle or nonroad engine (except for ocean-going vessels), or as heating oil or jet fuel may be reinstated by the retiring party for sale or use to demonstrate compliance with a 2010 RVO.

              (i) A duplicate of a valid RIN.
              (ii) Was based on incorrect volumes or volumes that have not been standardized to 60 °F.
              (iii) Has expired, as provided in § 80.1428(c).
              (iv) Was based on an incorrect equivalence value.
              (v) Deemed invalid under § 80.1467(g).
              (vi) Does not represent renewable fuel as defined in § 80.1401.
              (vii) Was assigned an incorrect “D” code value under § 80.1426(f) for the associated volume of fuel.
              (viii) [Reserved]
              (ix) Was otherwise improperly generated.
              (2) In the event that the same RIN is transferred to two or more parties, all such RINs are deemed invalid, unless EPA in its sole discretion determines that some portion of these RINs is valid.
              (b) Except as provided in § 80.1473, the following provisions apply in the case of RINs that are invalid:
              (1) Upon determination by any party that RINs owned are invalid, the party must keep copies and adjust its records, reports, and compliance calculations in which the invalid RINs were used. The party must retire the invalid RINs in the applicable RIN transaction reports under § 80.1451(c)(2) for the quarter in which the RINs were determined to be invalid.
              (2) Invalid RINs cannot be used to achieve compliance with the Renewable Volume Obligations of an obligated party or exporter, regardless of the party's good faith belief that the RINs were valid at the time they were acquired.
              (3) Any valid RINs remaining after invalid RINs are retired must first be applied to correct the transfer of invalid RINs to another party before applying the valid RINs to meet the party's Renewable Volume Obligations at the end of the compliance year.
              (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, improperly generated RINs may be used for compliance provided that all of the following conditions and requirements are satisfied and the renewable fuel producer or importer who improperly generated the RINs demonstrates that the conditions and requirements are satisfied through the reporting and recordkeeping requirements set forth below, that:
              (1) The number of RINs generated for a batch exceeds the number of RINs that should have been properly generated.
              (2) The RINs were improperly generated as a result of a broken meter, an inadvertent temperature correction error, or an inadvertent administrative error.
              (3) The renewable fuel producer or importer had in place at the time the RINs were improperly generated a quality assurance/quality control plan designed to ensure that process measuring equipment such as meters and temperature probes are properly maintained and to prevent inadvertent administrative errors.
              (4) The renewable fuel producer or importer has taken any appropriate additional steps to prevent similar violations from occurring in the future.
              (5) The improperly generated RINs have been transferred to another party.
              (6) The renewable fuel producer or importer has not improperly generated RINs for the reasons described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section on more than five batches during any calendar year.
              (7) All of the following remedial actions have been implemented within 30 days of the EMTS submission date of the improper RIN generation:
              (i) The renewable fuel producer or importer retires an equal number of valid RINs with the same D Code and RIN year as the properly generated RINs, using an EMTS retire code of 110.
              (ii) The renewable fuel producer or importer reports all the following information to EPA via EMTS, which EPA may make publicly available:
              (A) Company name.
              (B) Company ID.

              (L) EMTS Transaction ID of the original generation.
              (M) An explanation of how the violation occurred, and why the improperly generated RINs meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (N) Steps taken to prevent similar violations from occurring in the future.
              (O) Information under paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section.
              (P) Any additional information the Administrator may require.
              (8) The renewable fuel producer or importer maintains all records relating to the improper RIN generation and the associated remedial actions taken, including but not limited to any of the following:
              (i) All information regarding the generation of invalid RINs, including information that is sufficient to demonstrate that the improperly generated RINs meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (ii) Documents demonstrating that the renewable fuel producer or importer has implemented the quality control/quality assurance plan required in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and has taken all appropriate additional steps to prevent similar violations from occurring in the future.

Any party or corporate affiliate group required to calculate a holdings-to-obligation percentage under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and that has a holdings-to-obligation percentage greater than 130.00 percent for any calendar day in a compliance period, as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, has exceeded the secondary threshold.
              (d) Alternative gasoline and diesel production volume allowance. Parties that must calculate the secondary threshold under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may use alternative gasoline and diesel production volumes if all the following requirements are met:

              (1) The party must have a reasonable basis for using the alternative production numbers (e.g., selling or acquiring a refinery or a shutdown of a refinery).
              (2) When substituting the alternative production volume for the conventional RVO volume, the party must use actual production numbers for any completed quarter in the compliance period and extrapolated production numbers for any future quarters.
              (3) The party must meet the applicable recordkeeping requirements of § 80.1454.
              (4) The party must retain documentation of the reasonable basis and the calculations used and must provide these to the auditor conducting the attest engagement under § 80.1464.
              (e) Exemption from aggregation requirements. (1) A party may claim exemption from the requirement to aggregate D6 RIN holdings for any affiliate where one or more of the following apply:
              (i) There is an absence of common trading-level control and information sharing with the affiliate.
              (ii) The sharing of information regarding aggregation with the affiliate could lead either party to violate state or Federal law, or the law of a foreign jurisdiction.
              (iii) The affiliate is exempt from the regulations regarding commodities and securities exchanges under 17 CFR 150.4(b)(7).
              (2) A party must retain detailed, explanatory documentation supporting its exemption and must provide this documentation to the attest auditor under § 80.1464, and to EPA upon request. Such records include, but are not limited to, the following:

              § 80.1441
              Small refinery exemption.
              (a)(1) Transportation fuel produced at a refinery by a refiner, or foreign refiner (as defined at § 80.1465(a)), is exempt from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 from the renewable fuel standards of § 80.1405, and the owner or operator of the refinery, or foreign refinery, is exempt from the requirements that apply to obligated parties under this subpart M for fuel produced at the refinery if the refinery meets the definition of a small refinery under § 80.1401 for calendar year 2006.
              (2) The exemption of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall apply unless a refiner chooses to waive this exemption (as described in paragraph (f) of this section), or the exemption is extended (as described in paragraph (e) of this section).
              (3) For the purposes of this section, the term “refiner” shall include foreign refiners.
              (4) This exemption shall only apply to refineries that process crude oil through refinery processing units.
              (5) The small refinery exemption is effective immediately, except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
              (6) Refiners who own refineries that qualified as small under 40 CFR 80.1141 do not need to resubmit a small refinery verification letter under this subpart M. This paragraph (a) does not supersede § 80.1141.
              (b)(1) A refiner owning a small refinery must submit a verification letter to EPA containing all of the following information:
              (i) The annual average aggregate daily crude oil throughput for the period January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006 (as determined by dividing the aggregate throughput for the calendar year by the number 365).
              (ii) A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the letter is true to the best of his/her knowledge, and that the refinery was small as of December 31, 2006.
              (iii) Name, address, phone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address of a corporate contact person.
              (2) Verification letters must be submitted by July 1, 2010 to one of the addresses listed in paragraph (h) of this section.
              (3) For foreign refiners the small refinery exemption shall be effective upon approval, by EPA, of a small refinery application. The application must contain all of the elements required for small refinery verification letters (as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), must satisfy the provisions of § 80.1465(f) through (i) and (o), and must be submitted by July 1, 2010 to one of the addresses listed in paragraph (h) of this section.

              (4) Small refinery verification letters are not required for those refiners who have already submitted a complete verification letter under subpart K of this part 80. Verification letters submitted under subpart K prior to July 1, 2010 that satisfy the requirements of subpart K shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements for verification letters under this subpart M.
              (c) If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information regarding a refinery's crude throughput (pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) in its small refinery verification letter, the exemption will be void as of the effective date of these regulations.
              (d) If a refiner is complying on an aggregate basis for multiple refineries, any such refiner may exclude from the calculation of its Renewable Volume Obligations (under § 80.1407) transportation fuel from any refinery receiving the small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section.
              (e)(1) The exemption period in paragraph (a) of this section shall be extended by the Administrator for a period of not less than two additional years if a study by the Secretary of Energy determines that compliance with the requirements of this subpart would impose a disproportionate economic hardship on a small refinery.
              (2) A refiner may petition the Administrator for an extension of its small refinery exemption, based on disproportionate economic hardship, at any time.
              (i) A petition for an extension of the small refinery exemption must specify the factors that demonstrate a disproportionate economic hardship and must provide a detailed discussion regarding the hardship the refinery would face in producing transportation fuel meeting the requirements of § 80.1405 and the date the refiner anticipates that compliance with the requirements can reasonably be achieved at the small refinery.
              (ii) The Administrator shall act on such a petition not later than 90 days after the date of receipt of the petition.
              (iii) In order to qualify for an extension of its small refinery exemption, a refinery must meet the definition of “small refinery” in § 80.1401 for the most recent full calendar year prior to seeking an extension and must be projected to meet the definition of “small refinery” in § 80.1401 for the year or years for which an exemption is sought. Failure to meet the definition of small refinery for any calendar year for which an exemption was granted would invalidate the exemption for that calendar year.
              (f) At any time, a refiner with a small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section may waive that exemption upon notification to EPA.
              (1) A refiner's notice to EPA that it intends to waive its small refinery exemption must be received by November 1 to be effective in the next compliance year.
              (2) The waiver will be effective beginning on January 1 of the following calendar year, at which point the transportation fuel produced at that refinery will be subject to the renewable fuels standard of § 80.1405 and the owner or operator of the refinery shall be subject to all other requirements that apply to obligated parties under this Subpart M.
              (3) The waiver notice must be sent to EPA at one of the addresses listed in paragraph (h) of this section.
              (g) A refiner that acquires a refinery from either an approved small refiner (as defined under § 80.1442(a)) or another refiner with an approved small refinery exemption under paragraph (a) of this section shall notify EPA in writing no later than 20 days following the acquisition.
              (h) Verification letters under paragraph (b) of this section, petitions for small refinery hardship extensions under paragraph (e) of this section, and small refinery exemption waiver notices under paragraph (f) of this section shall be sent to one of the following addresses:

                Pennisetum purpureum per § 80.1426(f)(14)(i):
              (1) A Risk Mitigation Plan (Plan) that demonstrates the growth of Arundo donax or Pennisetum purpureum will not pose a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel. The Plan must identify and incorporate best management practices (BMPs) into the production, management, transport, collection, monitoring, and processing of the feedstock. To the extent practicable, the Risk Mitigation Plan should utilize a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach to examine each phase of the pathway to identify spread reduction steps. BMPs should include the development of mitigation strategies and plans to minimize escape and other impacts (e.g., minimize soil disturbance), incorporate desirable traits (e.g., sterility or reduced seed production), develop and implement dispersal mitigation protocols prior to cultivation, develop multiple year eradication controls. Eradication controls should follow an approach of early detection and rapid response (EDRR) to unintended spread. EDRR efforts should demonstrate the likelihood that invasions will be halted while still localized and identify and employ cooperative networks, communication forums, and consultation processes with federal, state, and local agencies. The Risk Mitigation Plan must provide for the following:
              (i) Monitoring and reporting data for a period prior to planting that is sufficient to establish a baseline, through crop production, and extending beyond crop production for a sufficient period after the field is no longer used for feedstock production to ensure no remnants of giant reed or napier grass survive or spread.
              (ii) Monitoring must include the area encompassing the feedstock growing areas, the transportation corridor between the growing areas and the renewable fuel production facility, and the renewable fuel production facility, extending to the distance of potential propagation of the feedstock species, or further if necessary.
              (iii) Monitoring must reflect the likelihood of spread specific to the feedstock.
              (iv) A closure plan providing for the destruction and removal of feedstock from the growing area upon abandonment by the feedstock grower or end of production.
              (v) A plan providing for an independent third party who will audit the monitoring and reporting conducted in accordance with the Plan on an annual basis, subject to approval of a different frequency by EPA.
              (2) A letter from the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to the renewable fuel producer stating USDA's conclusions and the bases therefore regarding whether the Arundo donax or Pennisetum purpureum does or does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel as proposed by the producer. This letter shall also include USDA's recommendation of whether it is appropriate to require the use of a financial mechanism to ensure the availability of financial resources sufficient to cover reasonable potential remediation costs associated with the invasive spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas. In coordination with USDA, EPA shall identify for the producer the appropriate USDA office from which the letter should originate.
              (3) Identification of all federal, state, regional, and local requirements related to invasive species that are applicable for the feedstock at the growing site and at all points between the growing site and the fuel production site.
              (4) A copy of all state and local growing permits held by the feedstock grower.
              (5) A communication plan for notifying EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, USDA, adjacent federal land management agencies, and any relevant state, tribal, regional, and local authorities as soon as possible after identification of the issue if the feedstock is detected outside planted area.
              (6) A copy of the agreement between the feedstock grower and fuel producer establishing all rights and duties of the parties related to the Risk Mitigation Plan and any other activities and liability associated with the prevention of the spread of Arundo donax and/or Pennisetum purpureum outside of the intended planting area.
              (7) A copy of the agreement between the fuel producer and an independent third party describing how the third party will audit the monitoring and reporting conducted in accordance with the Risk Mitigation Plan on an annual basis, subject to approval of a different timeframe by EPA.
              (8) Information on the financial resources or other financial mechanism (such as a state-administered fund, bond, or certificate of deposit) that would be available to finance reasonable remediation activities associated with the potential spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas, and information on whether it is necessary to have any further such resources or mechanism. EPA may require a demonstration that there is an adequate financial mechanism (such as a state-administered fund, bond, or certificate of deposit) to ensure the availability of financial resources sufficient to cover reasonable potential remediation costs associated with the spread of giant reed or napier grass beyond the intended planting areas.
              (9) EPA may require additional information as appropriate.
              (B) For a producer of renewable fuel made from Arundo donax or Pennisetum purpureum per § 80.1426(f)(14)(ii):
              (1) Clear and compelling evidence, including information and supporting data, demonstrating that Arundo donax or Pennisetum purpureum does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel. Evidence must include data collected from similar environments (soils, temperatures, precipitation, USDA Hardiness Zones) as the proposed feedstock production project site and accepted by the scientific community. Such a demonstration should include consideration of the elements of a Risk Mitigation Plan set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(x)(A) of this section, fully disclose the potential invasiveness of the feedstock, provide a closure plan for the destruction and removal of feedstock from the growing area upon abandonment by the feedstock grower or end of production, and explain why a Risk Mitigation Plan is not needed to make the required determination.
              (2) A letter from the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to the renewable fuel producer stating USDA's conclusions and the bases therefore regarding whether the Arundo donax or Pennisetum purpureum does or does not present a significant likelihood of spread beyond the planting area of the feedstock used for production of the renewable fuel as proposed by the producer or importer. In coordination with USDA, EPA shall identify for the producer the appropriate USDA office from which the letter should originate.

              (C) EPA may suspend a producer's registration for purposes of generating RINs for renewable fuel using Arundo donax or Pennisetum purpureum as a feedstock if such feedstock has spread beyond the intended planting area.
              (xi) For a producer of fuel oil meeting paragraph (2) of the definition of heating oil in § 80.1401:
              (A) An affidavit from the producer of the fuel oil stating that the fuel oil for which RINs have been generated will be sold for the purposes of heating interior spaces of homes or buildings to control ambient climate for human comfort, and no other purpose.

              § 80.1456
              What are the provisions for cellulosic biofuel waiver credits?
              (a) If EPA reduces the applicable volume of cellulosic biofuel pursuant to section 211(o)(7)(D)(i) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(7)(D)(i)) for any given compliance year, then EPA will provide cellulosic biofuel waiver credits for purchase for that compliance year.
              (1) The price of these cellulosic biofuel waiver credits will be set by EPA on an annual basis in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) The total cellulosic biofuel waiver credits available will be equal to the reduced cellulosic biofuel volume established by EPA for the compliance year.
              (b) Use of cellulosic biofuel waiver credits. (1) Cellulosic biofuel waiver credits are only valid for use in the compliance year that they are made available.
              (2) Cellulosic biofuel waiver credits are nonrefundable.
              (3) Cellulosic biofuel waiver credits are nontransferable.
              (4) Cellulosic biofuel waiver credits may only be used for an obligated party's current year cellulosic biofuel RVO and not towards any prior year deficit cellulosic biofuel volume obligations.
              (c) Purchase of cellulosic biofuel waiver credits. (1) Only parties with an RVO for cellulosic biofuel may purchase cellulosic biofuel waiver credits.
              (2) Cellulosic biofuel waiver credits shall be purchased from EPA at the time that a party submits its annual compliance report to EPA pursuant to § 80.1451(a)(1).

              (3) Parties may not purchase more cellulosic biofuel waiver credits than their current year cellulosic biofuel RVO minus cellulosic biofuel RINs with a D code of 3 that they own.
              
              (4) Cellulosic biofuel waiver credits may only be used to meet an obligated party's cellulosic biofuel RVO.
              (d) Setting the price of cellulosic biofuel waiver credits. (1) The price for cellulosic biofuel waiver credits shall be set equal to the greater of:
              (i) $0.25 per cellulosic biofuel waiver credit, adjusted for inflation in comparison to calendar year 2008; or
              (ii) $3.00 less the wholesale price of gasoline per cellulosic biofuel waiver credit, adjusted for inflation in comparison to calendar year 2008.
              (2) The wholesale price of gasoline will be calculated by averaging the most recent twelve monthly values for U.S. Total Gasoline Bulk Sales (Price) by Refiners as provided by the Energy Information Administration that are available as of September 30 of the year preceding the compliance period.
              (3) The inflation adjustment will be calculated by comparing the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. City Average, Unadjusted Index for All Items expenditure category as provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for June of the year preceding the compliance period to the comparable value reported for January 2009.
              (e) Cellulosic biofuel waiver credits under this section will only be able to be purchased on forms and following procedures prescribed by EPA.

              § 80.1457
              Petition process for aggregate compliance approach for foreign countries.
              (a) EPA may approve a petition for application of the aggregate compliance approach to planted crops and crop residue from existing agricultural land in a foreign country if EPA determines that an aggregate compliance approach will provide reasonable assurance that planted crops and crop residue from the country in question meet the definition of renewable biomass and will continue to meet the definition of renewable biomass, based on the submission of credible, reliable, and verifiable data.
              (1) As part of its evaluation, EPA will consider all of the following:
              (i) Whether there has been a reasonable identification of the “2007 baseline area of land,” defined as the total amount of cropland, pastureland, and land that is equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land in the country in question that was actively managed or fallow and nonforested on December 19, 2007.
              (ii) Whether information on the total amount of cropland, pastureland, and land that is equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land in the country in question for years preceding and following calendar year 2007 shows that the 2007 baseline area of land identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is not likely to be exceeded in the future.
              (iii) Whether economic considerations, legal constraints, historical land use and agricultural practices and other factors show that it is likely that producers of planted crops and crop residue will continue to use agricultural land within the 2007 baseline area of land identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section into the future, as opposed to clearing and cultivating land not included in the 2007 baseline area of land.
              (iv) Whether there is a reliable method to evaluate on an annual basis whether the 2007 baseline area of land identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is being or has been exceeded.
              (v) Whether a credible and reliable entity has been identified to conduct data gathering and analysis, including annual identification of the aggregate amount of cropland, pastureland, and land that is equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land, needed for the annual EPA evaluation specified in § 80.1454(g)(1), and whether the data, analyses, and methodologies are publicly available.
              (2) [Reserved]
              (b) Any petition and all supporting materials submitted under paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted both in English and its original language (if other than English), and must include all of the following or an explanation of why it is not needed for EPA to consider the petition:

              (1) Maps or electronic data identifying the boundaries of the land for which the petitioner seeks approval of an aggregate compliance approach.
              (2) The total amount of land that is cropland, pastureland, or land equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land within the geographic boundaries specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that was cleared or cultivated prior to December 19, 2007 and that was actively managed or fallow and nonforested on that date, and
              (3) Land use data that demonstrates that the land identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is cropland, pastureland or land equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land that was cleared or cultivated prior to December 19, 2007, and that was actively managed or fallow and nonforested on that date, which may include any of the following:
              (i) Satellite imagery or data.
              (ii) Aerial photography.
              (iii) Census data.

              (6) A plan describing how the petitioner will identify a credible and reliable entity who will, on a continuing basis, conduct data gathering, analysis, and submittal to assist EPA in making an annual determination of whether the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section remains satisfied.
              (7) A letter, signed by a national government representative at the ministerial level or equivalent, confirming that the petition and all supporting data have been reviewed and verified by the ministry (or ministries) or department(s) of the national government with primary expertise in agricultural land use patterns, practices, data, and statistics, that the data support a finding that planted crops and crop residue from the specified country meet the definition of renewable biomass and will continue to meet the definition of renewable biomass, and that the responsible national government ministry (or ministries) or department(s) will review and verify the data submitted on an annual basis to facilitate EPA's annual evaluation of the 2007 baseline area of land specified in § 80.1454(g)(1) for the country in question.
              (8) Any additional information the Administrator may require.
              (c) EPA will issue a Federal Register notice informing the public of receipt of any petition submitted pursuant to this section and will provide a 60-day period for public comment. If EPA approves a petition it will issue a Federal Register notice announcing its decision and specifying an effective date for the application of the aggregate compliance approach to planted crops and crop residue from the country. Thereafter, the planted crops and crop residue from the country will be covered by the aggregate compliance approach set forth in § 80.1454(g), or as otherwise specified pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) If EPA grants a petition to establish an aggregate compliance approach for planted crops and crop residue from a foreign country, it may include any conditions that EPA considers appropriate in light of the conditions and circumstances involved.
              (e)(1) EPA may withdraw its approval of the aggregate compliance approach for the planted crops and crop residue from the country in question if:

              (i) EPA determines that the data submitted pursuant to the plan described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section does not demonstrate that the amount of cropland, pastureland and land equivalent to U.S. Conservation Reserve Program land within the geographic boundaries covered by the approved petition does not exceed the 2007 baseline area of land;
              (ii) EPA determines based on other information that the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section is no longer satisfied; or
              (iii) EPA determines that the data needed for its annual evaluation has not been collected and submitted in a timely and appropriate manner.
              (2) If EPA withdraws its approval for a given country, then producers using planted crops or crop residue from that country will be subject to the individual recordkeeping and reporting requirements of § 80.1454(b) through (d) in accordance with the schedule specified in § 80.1454(g).

              (i) Designation of the renewable fuel as RFS-FRRF.
              (ii) The certification required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (d) Load port independent testing and producer identification. (1) On each occasion that RFS-FRRF is loaded onto a vessel for transport to the United States the RIN-generating foreign producer shall have an independent third party do all the following:
              (i) Inspect the vessel prior to loading and determine the volume of any tank bottoms.
              (ii) Determine the volume of RFS-FRRF, standardized per § 80.1426(f)(8), loaded onto the vessel (exclusive of any tank bottoms before loading).
              (iii) Obtain the EPA-assigned registration number of the foreign producer.
              (iv) Determine the name and country of registration of the vessel used to transport the RFS-FRRF to the United States.
              (v) Determine the date and time the vessel departs the port serving the foreign producer.
              (vi) Review original documents that reflect movement and storage of the RFS-FRRF from the RIN-generating foreign producer to the load port, and from this review determine all the following:
              (A) The facility at which the RFS-FRRF was produced.
              (B) That the RFS-FRRF remained segregated from Non-RFS-FRRF and other RFS-FRRF produced by a different foreign producer.

              (4) United States substantive and procedural laws shall apply to any civil or criminal enforcement action against the foreign producer or any employee of the foreign producer related to the provisions of this section.
              (5) Applying to be an approved foreign producer under this section, or producing or exporting renewable fuel under such approval, and all other actions to comply with the requirements of this subpart relating to such approval constitute actions or activities covered by and within the meaning of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(2), but solely with respect to actions instituted against the foreign producer, its agents and employees in any court or other tribunal in the United States for conduct that violates the requirements applicable to the foreign producer under this subpart, including conduct that violates the False Statements Accountability Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 1001) and section 113(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7413).
              (6) The foreign producer, or its agents or employees, will not seek to detain or to impose civil or criminal remedies against EPA inspectors or auditors for actions performed within the scope of EPA employment or contract related to the provisions of this section.

              (1) The RIN-generating foreign producer shall post a bond of the amount calculated using the following equation
              
              Bond = G * $0.01
              
              
                Where
                
                Bond = amount of the bond in U.S. dollars.

                G = the greater of: the largest volume of renewable fuel produced by the foreign producer and exported to the United States, in gallons, during a single calendar year among the five preceding calendar years, or the largest volume of renewable fuel that the foreign producers expects to export to the Unites States during any calendar year identified in the Production Outlook Report required by § 80.1449. If the volume of renewable fuel exported to the United States increases above the largest volume identified in the Production Outlook Report during any calendar year, the foreign producer shall increase the bond to cover the shortfall within 90 days.
              
              
              (2) Bonds shall be posted by any of the following methods:
              (i) Paying the amount of the bond to the Treasurer of the United States.
              (ii) Obtaining a bond in the proper amount from a third party surety agent that is payable to satisfy United States administrative or judicial judgments against the foreign producer, provided EPA agrees in advance as to the third party and the nature of the surety agreement.

              (i) Be used to satisfy any judicial judgment that results from an administrative or judicial enforcement action for conduct in violation of this subpart, including where such conduct violates the False Statements Accountability Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 1001) and section 113(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7413);
              (ii) Be provided by a corporate surety that is listed in the United States Department of Treasury Circular 570 “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds”; and
              (iii) Include a commitment that the bond will remain in effect for at least five years following the end of latest annual reporting period that the foreign producer produces renewable fuel pursuant to the requirements of this subpart.
              (4) On any occasion a foreign producer bond is used to satisfy any judgment, the foreign producer shall increase the bond to cover the amount used within 90 days of the date the bond is used.
              (i) English language reports. Any document submitted to EPA by a foreign producer shall be in English, or shall include an English language translation.
              (j) Prohibitions. (1) No person may combine RFS-FRRF with any Non-RFS-FRRF, and no person may combine RFS-FRRF with any RFS-FRRF produced at a different production facility, until the importer has met all the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.
              (2) No foreign producer or other person may cause another person to commit an action prohibited in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, or that otherwise violates the requirements of this section.
              (3) No foreign producer and importer may generate RINs for the same volume of renewable fuel.
              (4) A foreign producer of renewable fuel is prohibited from generating RINs in excess of the number for which the bond requirements of this section have been satisfied.
              (k) Requirements for United States importers of RFS-FRRF. Any United States importers of RFS-FRRF shall meet all the following requirements:
              (1) Renewable fuel shall be classified as RFS-FRRF according to the designation by the foreign producer if this designation is supported by product transfer documents prepared by the foreign producer as required in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (2) For each renewable fuel batch classified as RFS-FRRF, any United States importer shall have an independent third party do all the following:
              (i) Determine the volume of renewable fuel, standardized per § 80.1426(f)(8), in the vessel.
              (ii) Use the foreign producer's RFS-FRRF certification to determine the name and EPA-assigned registration number of the foreign producer that produced the RFS-FRRF.

              (ii) The foreign producer, containing the information determined under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, and including identification of the port at which the product was offloaded, and any RINs retired under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
              (5) Any United States importer shall meet all other requirements of this subpart for any imported renewable fuel that is not classified as RFS-FRRF under paragraph (k)(1) of this section.
              (l) Truck imports of RFS-FRRF produced by a foreign producer. (1) Any foreign producer whose RFS-FRRF is transported into the United States by truck may petition EPA to use alternative procedures to meet all the following requirements:
              (i) Certification under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (ii) Load port and port of entry testing under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

              (2) These alternative procedures must ensure RFS-FRRF remains segregated from Non-RFS-FRRF until it is imported into the United States. The petition will be evaluated based on whether it adequately addresses all of the following:
              (i) Contracts with any facilities that receive and/or transport RFS-FRRF that prohibit the commingling of RFS-FRRF with Non-RFS-FRRF or RFS-FRRF from other foreign producers.
              (ii) Attest procedures to be conducted annually by an independent third party that review loading records and import documents based on volume reconciliation to confirm that all RFS-FRRF remains segregated.
              (3) The petition described in this section must be submitted to EPA along with the application for approval as a foreign producer under this subpart.
              (m) Additional attest requirements for producers of RFS-FRRF. The following additional procedures shall be carried out by any producer of RFS-FRRF as part of the attest engagement required for renewable fuel producers under this subpart M.
              (1) Obtain listings of all tenders of RFS-FRRF. Agree the total volume of tenders from the listings to the volumes determined by the third party under paragraph (d) of this section.
              (2) For each tender under paragraph (m)(1) of this section, where the renewable fuel is loaded onto a marine vessel, report as a finding the name and country of registration of each vessel, and the volumes of RFS-FRRF loaded onto each vessel.
              (3) Select a sample from the list of vessels identified in paragraph (m)(2) of this section used to transport RFS-FRRF, in accordance with the guidelines in § 80.127, and for each vessel selected perform all the following:
              (i) Obtain the report of the independent third party, under paragraph (d) of this section, and of the United States importer under paragraph (k) of this section.
              (A) Agree the information in these reports with regard to vessel identification and renewable fuel volume.
              (B) Identify, and report as a finding, each occasion the load port and port of entry volume results differ by more than the amount allowed in paragraph (e) of this section, and determine whether the importer retired the appropriate amount of RINs as required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and submitted the applicable reports under § 80.1451 in accordance with paragraph (k)(4) of this section.
              (ii) Obtain the documents used by the independent third party to determine transportation and storage of the RFS-FRRF from the foreign producer's facility to the load port, under paragraph (d) of this section. Obtain tank activity records for any storage tank where the RFS-FRRF is stored, and activity records for any mode of transportation used to transport the RFS-FRRF prior to being loaded onto the vessel. Use these records to determine whether the RFS-FRRF was produced at the foreign producer's facility that is the subject of the attest engagement, and whether the RFS-FRRF was mixed with any Non-RFS-FRRF or any RFS-FRRF produced at a different facility.

              (4) Select a sample from the list of vessels identified in paragraph (m)(2) of this section used to transport RFS-FRRF, in accordance with the guidelines in § 80.127, and for each vessel selected perform the following:
              (i) Obtain a commercial document of general circulation that lists vessel arrivals and departures, and that includes the port and date of departure of the vessel, and the port of entry and date of arrival of the vessel.
              (ii) Agree the vessel's departure and arrival locations and dates from the independent third party and United States importer reports to the information contained in the commercial document.
              (5) Obtain a separate listing of the tenders under this paragraph (m)(5) where the RFS-FRRF is loaded onto a marine vessel. Select a sample from this listing in accordance with the guidelines in § 80.127, and obtain a commercial document of general circulation that lists vessel arrivals and departures, and that includes the port and date of departure and the ports and dates where the renewable fuel was offloaded for the selected vessels. Determine and report as a finding the country where the renewable fuel was offloaded for each vessel selected.
              (6) In order to complete the requirements of this paragraph (m) an auditor shall:
              (i) Be independent of the foreign producer;
              (ii) Be licensed as a Certified Public Accountant in the United States and a citizen of the United States, or be approved in advance by EPA based on a demonstration of ability to perform the procedures required in §§ 80.125 through 80.127, 80.130, 80.1464, and this paragraph (m); and
              (iii) Sign a commitment that contains the provisions specified in paragraph (f) of this section with regard to activities and documents relevant to compliance with the requirements of §§ 80.125 through 80.127, 80.130, 80.1464, and this paragraph (m).
              (n) Withdrawal or suspension of foreign producer approval. EPA may withdraw or suspend a foreign producer's approval where any of the following occur:

              (o) Additional requirements for applications, reports and certificates. Any application for approval as a foreign producer, alternative procedures under paragraph (l) of this section, any report, certification, or other submission required under this section shall be:
              (1) Submitted in accordance with procedures specified by the Administrator, including use of any forms that may be specified by the Administrator.
              (2) Signed by the president or owner of the foreign producer company, or by that person's immediate designee, and shall contain the following declaration: “I hereby certify: (1) That I have actual authority to sign on behalf of and to bind [INSERT NAME OF FOREIGN PRODUCER] with regard to all statements contained herein; (2) that I am aware that the information contained herein is being Certified, or submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, under the requirements of 40 CFR part 80, subpart M, and that the information is material for determining compliance under these regulations; and (3) that I have read and understand the information being Certified or submitted, and this information is true, complete and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief after I have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to verify the accuracy thereof.

              (2) Any RIN that is obtained, sold, transferred, or held that is in excess of the number for which the bond requirements of this section have been satisfied is an invalid RIN under § 80.1431.
              (3) Any RIN that is obtained from a person located outside the United States that is not an approved foreign RIN owner under this section is an invalid RIN under § 80.1431.
              (4) No foreign RIN owner or other person may cause another person to commit an action prohibited in this paragraph (g), or that otherwise violates the requirements of this section.
              (h) Additional attest requirements for foreign RIN owners. The following additional requirements apply to any foreign RIN owner as part of the attest engagement required for RIN owners under this subpart M.

              § 80.1474
              Replacement requirements for invalidly generated RINs.
              (a) Responsibility for replacement of invalid verified RINs. (1) The generator of the A-RIN and the independent third-party auditor that verified the A-RIN are required to replace invalidly generated A-RINs with valid RINs pursuant to the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (2) The generator of the B-RIN and the obligated party that owns the B-RIN are required to replace invalidly generated B-RINs with valid RINs pursuant to the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (3) The generator of the Q-RIN and the obligated party that owns the Q-RIN are required to replace invalidly generated Q-RINs with valid RINs pursuant to the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (4) The generator of an unverified RIN and the obligated party that owns an unverified RIN are required to replace invalidly generated and unverified RINs pursuant to the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
              (b) Identification and treatment of potentially invalid RINs (PIRs). (1) Any RIN can be identified as a PIR by the RIN generator, an independent third-party auditor that verified the RIN, or the EPA.

              (2) For PIRs identified by the RIN generator, the generator is required to notify the EPA via the EMTS support line (support@epamts-support.com) within five business days of the identification, including an initial explanation of why the RIN is believed to be invalid, and is required to take any of the following corrective actions within 30 days:
              (i) Retire the PIR.
              
              (ii) Retire a valid RIN meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

              (3) For PIRs identified by the independent third-party auditor that verified the RIN, the independent third-party auditor is required to notify the EPA via the EMTS support line (support@epamts-support.com) and the RIN generator in writing within five business days of the identification, including an initial explanation of why the RIN is believed to be invalid.
              (4) Within 30 days of being notified by the EPA or the independent third-party auditor that verified the RIN that a RIN is a PIR, the RIN generator is required to take one of the following actions:
              (i) In the event that the EPA identifies a RIN as a PIR, do one of the following:
              (A) Retire the PIR.
              (B) Retire a valid RIN following the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

              (C) Submit a demonstration in writing to the EPA via the EMTS support line (support@epamts-support.com) that the PIR is valid.
              (1) If the EPA determines that the demonstration is satisfactory, the RIN will no longer be considered a PIR.
              (2) If the EPA determines that the demonstration is not satisfactory, the PIR will be deemed invalid and the PIR generator must retire the PIR or a valid RIN following the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section within 30 days of notification by the EPA.
              (ii) In the event that the independent third-party auditor identifies a RIN as a PIR, do one of the following:
              (A) Retire the PIR.
              (B) Retire a valid RIN following the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

              (C) Submit a demonstration in writing to the independent third-party auditor and the EPA via the EMTS support line (support@epamts-support.com) that the PIR is valid.
              (1) If the independent third-party auditor determines that the demonstration is satisfactory, the PIR will be deemed to be a valid RIN; however, the EPA reserves the right to make a determination regarding the validity of the RIN.
              (2) If the independent third-party auditor determines that the demonstration is not satisfactory, the EPA will then make a determination whether the demonstration is not satisfactory, and if so, the PIR will be deemed invalid and the PIR generator must retire the PIR or a valid RIN following the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section within 30 days of notification by the EPA.
              (5) Within 60 days of receiving a notification from the EPA that a PIR generator has failed to perform a corrective action required pursuant to this section:
              (i) For A-RINs, the independent third-party auditor that verified the PIR is required to retire valid RINs meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
              (ii) For Q-RINs, B-RINs, and unverified RINs, the party that owns the invalid RIN is required to do one of the following:
              (A) Retire the invalid RIN.
              (B) If the invalid RIN has already been used for compliance with an obligated party's RVO, correct the RVO to subtract the invalid RIN.
              (c) Failure to take corrective action. Any person who fails to meet a requirement under paragraph (b)(4) or (b)(5) of this section shall be liable for full performance of such requirement, and each day of non-compliance shall be deemed a separate violation pursuant to § 80.1460(f). The administrative process for replacement of invalid RINs does not, in any way, limit the ability of the United States to exercise any other authority to bring an enforcement action under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, the fuels regulations at 40 CFR part 80, or any other applicable law.
              (d) The following specifications apply when retiring valid RINs to replace PIRs or invalid RINs:
              (1) When a RIN is retired to replace a PIR or invalid RIN, the D code of the retired RIN must be eligible to be used towards meeting all the renewable volume obligations as the PIR or invalid RIN it is replacing, as specified in § 80.1427(a)(2).

              (2) The number of RINs retired must be equal to the number of PIRs or invalid RINs being replaced, subject to paragraph (e) or (f) of this section if applicable, and § 80.1470(c).
              (e) Limited exemption for invalid B-RINs verified during the interim period.

                Where:
                
                LECB,i = Limited exemption for cellulosic biofuel for year i.
                LEBBD,i = Limited exemption for biomass-based diesel for year i.
                LEAB,i = Limited exemption for advanced biofuel for year i.

              (3) If the number of invalidly generated B-RINs required to be retired or replaced in a calendar year is less than or equal to LE as calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the entire RIN retirement obligation is excused.
              (4) If the number of invalidly generated B-RINs required to be retired or replaced in a calendar year is greater than LE as calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the retirement of a number of B-RINs equal to two percent of the obligated party's RVO is excused.
              (5) The limited exemption for B-RINs applies only in calendar years 2013 and 2014 during the interim period.
              (f) Limited exemption for invalid Q-RINs. (1) In the event that an obligated party is required to retire or replace an invalid RIN that is a Q-RIN pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the obligated party will be afforded a “limited exemption” (LE) equal to two percent of its annual Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) for calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016.
              (2) Limited exemptions are calculated as follows:
              
              LECB,i = 0.02 × RVOCB,i
              
              LEBBD,i = 0.02 × RVOBBD,i

              § 80.1502
              What are the survey requirements related to gasoline-ethanol blends?
              Any gasoline refiner, gasoline importer, ethanol blender, ethanol producer, or ethanol importer who manufactures, introduces into commerce, sells or offers for sale E15, gasoline, blendstock for oxygenate blending, ethanol, or gasoline-ethanol blend that is intended for use in or as E15 shall comply with the survey program requirements in either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section. These same parties are also subject to paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this section regardless of whether they choose the survey program requirements in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section. In the case of ethanol producers and ethanol importers, the ethanol that is produced or imported shall be deemed as intended for use in E15 unless an ethanol producer or an ethanol importer demonstrates that it was not intended for such use.
              (a) Survey option 1. In order to satisfy the survey program requirements, any gasoline refiner, gasoline importer, ethanol blender, ethanol producer, or ethanol importer who manufactures, introduces into commerce, sells or offers for sale E15, gasoline, blendstock for oxygenate blending, ethanol, or gasoline-ethanol blend intended for use in or as E15 shall properly conduct a program of compliance surveys in accordance with a survey program plan which has been approved by EPA in all areas which may be reasonably expected to be supplied with their gasoline, blendstock for oxygenate blending, ethanol, or gasoline-ethanol blend if these may be used to manufacture E15 or as E15 at any time during the year. Such approval shall be based upon the survey program plan meeting the following criteria:
              (1) The survey program shall consist of at least quarterly surveys which shall occur during the following time periods in every year during which the gasoline refiner, gasoline importer, ethanol blender, ethanol producer, or ethanol importer introduces E15 into commerce:
              (i) One survey during the period January 1 through March 31;
              (ii) One survey during the period April 1 through June 30;
              (iii) One survey during the period July 1 through September 30; and
              (iv) One survey during the period October 1 through December 31.
              (2) The survey program plan shall meet all of the requirements of paragraph (b), except paragraphs (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(v) of this section. The survey program plan shall specify the sampling strata, clusters and area, and number of samples to be included. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in order to comply with this paragraph the survey plan need not be conducted by a consortium.
              (b) Survey option 2. (1) To comply with the requirements under this paragraph (b), any gasoline refiner, gasoline importer, ethanol blender, ethanol producer, or ethanol importer who manufactures, introduces into commerce, sells or offers for sale E15, gasoline, blendstock for oxygenate blending, ethanol, or gasoline-ethanol blend intended for use in or as E15 must participate in a consortium which arranges to have an independent survey association conduct a statistically valid program of compliance surveys pursuant to a survey program plan which has been approved by EPA, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section.
              (2) The consortium survey program under this paragraph (b) must be:
              (i) Planned and conducted by a survey association that is independent of the ethanol blenders, ethanol producers, ethanol importers, gasoline refiners, and/or gasoline importers that arrange to have the survey conducted. In order to be considered independent:
              (A) Representatives of the survey association shall not be an employee of any ethanol blender, ethanol producer, ethanol importer, gasoline refiner, or gasoline importer;

              (B) The survey association shall be free from any obligation to or interest in any ethanol blender, ethanol producer, ethanol importer, gasoline refiner, or gasoline importer; and
              (C) The ethanol blenders, ethanol producers, ethanol importers, gasoline refiners, and/or gasoline importers that arrange to have the survey conducted shall be free from any obligation to or interest in the survey association.
              (ii) Conducted at retail outlets that sell gasoline; and
              (iii) Represent all gasoline dispensed nationwide.
              (3) Independent Survey Association Requirements. The consortium described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall require the independent survey association conducting the surveys to:
              (i) Submit to EPA for approval each calendar year a proposed survey program plan in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
              (ii) Obtain samples of gasoline offered for sale at gasoline retail outlets in accordance with the survey program plan approved under this paragraph (b), or immediately notify EPA of any refusal of retail outlets to allow samples to be taken.
              (iii) Test, or arrange to be tested, the samples required under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for Reid vapor pressure (RVP), and oxygenate content as follows:
              (A) Samples collected at retail outlets shall be shipped the same day the samples are collected via ground service to the laboratory and analyzed for oxygenate content. Samples collected at a dispenser labeled E15 in any manner, or at a tank serving such a dispenser, shall also be analyzed for RVP during the high ozone season defined in § 80.27(a)(2)(ii) or any SIP approved or promulgated under sections 110 or 172 of the Clean Air Act. Such analysis shall be completed within 10 days after receipt of the sample in the laboratory. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require RVP testing of a sample from any dispenser or tank serving it unless the dispenser is labeled E15 in any manner.
              (B) Any laboratory to be used by the independent survey association for oxygenate or RVP testing shall be approved by EPA and its test method for determining oxygenate content shall be a method permitted under § 80.46(g), and its test method for determining RVP shall be the method permitted under § 80.46(b).
              (iv) In the case of any test that yields a result that does not match the label affixed to the product (e.g., a sample greater than 15 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser labeled as “E15” or a sample containing greater than 10 volume percent ethanol and not more than 15 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser not labeled as “E15”), or the RVP standard of § 80.27(a)(2) or any SIP approved or promulgated under sections 110 or 172 of the Clean Air Act, the independent survey association shall, within 24 hours after the laboratory has completed analysis of the sample, send notification of the test result as follows:
              (A) In the case of a sample collected at a retail outlet at which the brand name of a gasoline refiner or gasoline importer is displayed, to the gasoline refiner or gasoline importer, and EPA. This initial notification to a gasoline refiner or gasoline importer shall include specific information concerning the name and address of the retail outlet, contact information, the brand, and the ethanol content, and the RVP if required, of the sample.
              (B) In the case of a sample collected at other retail outlets, to the retailer and EPA, and such notice shall contain the same information as in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(A) of this section.
              (C) The independent survey association shall provide notice to the identified contact person or persons for each party in writing (which includes e-mail or facsimile) and, if requested by the identified contact person, by telephone.
              (v) Confirm that each fuel dispenser sampled is labeled as required in § 80.1501 by confirming that:
              (A) The label meets the appearance and content requirements of § 80.1501.
              (B) The label is located on the fuel dispenser according to the requirements in § 80.1501.

              (vi) In the case of a fuel dispenser that is improperly labeled, or whose fuel does not meet the RVP standards of § 80.27(a)(2) the survey association shall provide notice as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section.
              (vii) Provide to EPA quarterly and annual summary survey reports which include the information specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
              (viii) Maintain all records relating to the surveys conducted under this paragraph (b) for a period of at least five (5) years.
              (ix) Permit any representative of EPA to monitor at any time the conducting of the surveys, including sample collection, transportation, storage, and analysis.
              (4) Survey Plan Design Requirements. The proposed survey program plan required under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall, at a minimum, include the following:
              (i) Number of Surveys. The survey program plan shall include four quarterly surveys each calendar year. The four quarterly surveys collectively are called the survey series as defined in § 80.1500.
              (ii) Sampling Areas. The survey program plan shall include sampling in all sampling strata, as defined in § 80.1500, during each survey. These sampling strata shall be further divided into discrete sampling areas or clusters. Each survey shall include sampling in at least 40 sampling areas in each stratum which are randomly selected.
              (iii) No advance notice of surveys. The survey plan shall include procedures to keep the identification of the sampling areas that are included in any survey plan confidential from any regulated party prior to the beginning of a survey in an area. However, this information shall not be kept confidential from EPA.
              (iv) Retail outlet selection. (A) The retail outlets to be sampled in a sampling area shall be selected from among all retail outlets in the sampling area that sell gasoline, with the probability of selection proportionate to the volume of gasoline sold at the retail outlets; the sample should also include retail outlets with different brand names as well as those retail outlets that are unbranded.
              (B) In the case of any retail outlet from which a sample of gasoline was collected during a survey and determined to have an ethanol content that does not match the fuel dispenser label (e.g., a sample greater than 15 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser labeled as “E15” or a sample with greater than 10 volume percent ethanol and not more than 15 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser not labeled as “E15”) or determined to have a dispenser containing fuel whose RVP does not comply with § 80.27(a)(2) or any SIP approved or promulgated under sections 110 or 172 of the Clean Air Act, that retail outlet shall be included in the subsequent survey.
              (C) One sample of each product dispensed as gasoline shall be collected at each retail outlet, and separate samples shall be taken that represent the gasoline contained in each gasoline storage tank unless collection of separate samples is not practicable.
              (v) Number of samples. (A) The minimum number of samples to be included in the survey plan for each calendar year shall be calculated as follows:
              
                ER18JY14.003
              
              
                Where:
                
                  n = Minimum number of samples in a year-long survey series.
                However, in no case shall n be smaller than 7,500.
                Zα = Upper percentile point from the normal distribution to achieve a one-tailed 95% confidence level (5% α-level). Thus, Zα equals 1.645.
                Zβ = Upper percentile point to achieve 95% power. Thus, Zβ equals 1.645.
                φ1 = The maximum proportion of non-compliant stations for a region to be deemed compliant. In this test, the parameter needs to be 5% or greater, i.e., 5% or more of the stations, within a stratum such that the region is considered non-compliant. For this survey, φ1 will be 5%.
                
                φo = The underlying proportion of non-compliant stations in a sample. For the first survey plan, φo will be 2.3%. For subsequent survey plans, φo will be the average of the proportion of stations found to be non-compliant over the previous four surveys.
                Stn = Number of sampling strata. For purposes of this survey program, Stn equals 3.
                Fa = Adjustment factor for the number of extra samples required to compensate for collected samples that cannot be included in the survey, based on the number of additional samples required during the previous four surveys. However, in no case shall the value of Fa be smaller than 1.1.
                Fb = Adjustment factor for the number of samples required to resample each retail outlet with test results exceeding the labeled amount (e.g., a sample greater than 15 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser labeled as “E15”, a sample with greater than 10 volume percent ethanol and not more than 15 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser not labeled as “E15”), or a sample dispensed from a fuel dispenser labeled as “E15” with greater than the applicable seasonal and geographic RVP pursuant to § 80.27, based on the rate of resampling required during the previous four surveys. However, in no case shall the value of Fb be smaller than 1.1.
                Sun = Number of surveys per year. For purposes of this survey program, Sun equals 4.
              
              
              (B) The number of samples determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section, after being incremented as necessary to allocate whole numbers of samples to each cluster, shall be distributed approximately equally for the quarterly surveys conducted during the calendar year.
              (5) Summary survey reports. The quarterly and annual summary survey reports required under paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section shall include the following information:
              (i) An identification of the parties that are participating in the survey.
              (ii) The identification of each sampling area included in a survey and the dates that the samples were collected in that area.
              (iii) For each retail outlet sampled:
              (A) The identification of the retail outlet;
              (B) The gasoline refiner or gasoline importer brand name displayed, if any;
              (C) The fuel dispenser labeling (e.g., “E15”);
              (D) The sample test result for oxygenate content, and RVP result, if any;
              (E) The test method used to determine oxygenate content under § 80.46(g); and
              (F) The test method used to determine RVP under § 80.46(b).
              (iv) Ethanol level summary statistics by brand and unbranded for each sampling area, strata, and survey series. These summary statistics shall:
              (A) Include the number of samples, the average, median and range of ethanol content, expressed in volume percent.
              (B) [Reserved]
              (v) The quarterly reports required under this paragraph (b)(5) are due 60 days following the end of the quarter. The annual reports required under this paragraph (b)(5) are due 60 days following the end of the calendar year.
              (vi) The reports required under this paragraph (b)(5) shall be submitted to EPA in an electronic spreadsheet.
              (c) Procedures for obtaining approval of survey plan and providing required notices. The first year in which a survey program is conducted may consist of only a portion of a calendar year ending on December 31 (i.e., in the initial year, a survey program may begin on a date after January 1, but would still end on December 31). Subsequent survey programs shall be conducted on a calendar year basis.

                ER28AP14.141
              
              
                Where:
                
                Sa = The refinery or importer annual average sulfur level, in ppm (mg/kg).
                Vi = The volume of gasoline produced or imported in batch i, in gallons.
                Si = The sulfur content of batch i determined under § 80.1630, in ppm (mg/kg).
                n = The number of batches of gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period.
                i = Individual batch of gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period.
              
              
              (2) The annual average sulfur level calculation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be conducted to two decimal places using the rounding procedure specified in § 80.9.
              (d) Oxygenate added downstream from the refinery or import facility. A refiner or importer may include oxygenate added downstream from the refinery or import facility when calculating the sulfur content of a batch, provided that the following requirements are met:
              (1) For oxygenate added to reformulated gasoline, RBOB, conventional gasoline, or CBOB, the refiner or importer shall calculate the sulfur content of the batch by volume weighting the sulfur content of the conventional gasoline or CBOB and the sulfur content of the added oxygenate pursuant to the following requirements:
              (i) The sulfur content of any reformulated gasoline, RBOB, conventional gasoline, or CBOB shall be determined by sampling and testing each batch pursuant to § 80.46 or § 80.47 as applicable.
              (ii) For each complete annual compliance period, the sulfur content of all the oxygenate added downstream of the refinery or import facility shall be determined by one of the following methods:
              (A) Testing the sulfur content of a sample of the oxygenate pursuant to § 80.46 or § 80.47, as applicable. The refiner or importer must demonstrate through records relating to sampling, testing, and blending that the test result was derived from a representative sample of the oxygenate that was blended with the batch of gasoline or BOB.
              (B) If the oxygenate is denatured fuel ethanol, the sulfur content may be assumed to be 5.00 ppm.
              (iii) For denatured fuel ethanol, the refiner or importer may assume that the denatured fuel ethanol was blended with gasoline or BOB at a concentration of 10 volume percent, unless the refiner or importer can demonstrate that a different amount of denatured fuel ethanol was actually blended with a batch of gasoline or BOB.
              (iv) The refiner or importer of conventional gasoline or CBOB must comply with the requirements of § 80.101(d)(4)(ii).
              (v) The refiner or importer of reformulated gasoline or RBOB must comply with the requirements of § 80.69(a).
              (vi) Any reformulated gasoline, RBOB, conventional gasoline, or CBOB must meet the per-gallon sulfur standard of paragraph (a)(2) of this section prior to calculating any dilution from the oxygenate added downstream.
              (vii) The reported volume of the batch is the combined volume of the reformulated gasoline, RBOB, conventional gasoline, or CBOB and the downstream added oxygenate.
              (2) The refiner or importer who first certifies the gasoline, CBOB, or RBOB is the only person who may account for the downstream addition of oxygenate pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. On any occasion where any person downstream of the refinery or importer that produced or imported previously certified gasoline, CBOB or RBOB adds oxygenate to such product, it shall not include the volume and sulfur content of the oxygenate in any compliance calculations or for credit generation under this subpart O.
              (e) Exclusions. Refiners and importers must exclude from compliance calculations all the following:
              (1) Gasoline that was not produced at the refinery or imported by the importer.

              (2) In the case of an importer, gasoline that was imported as Certified Sulfur-FRGAS.
              
              (3) Blendstocks transferred to others, except RBOB and CBOB as provided in this subpart O.
              (4) Previously certified gasoline (PCG).
              (5) Gasoline exempted from standards under § 80.1601(b).
              (f) Compliance calculation for the annual average sulfur standard. (1) Compliance by a refinery or importer with the gasoline sulfur annual average standard at paragraph (a)(1) of this section is achieved if, for calendar year y, the compliance sulfur value is less than or equal to 10 times the total gasoline volume produced or imported, as determined by the following equation:
              
              CSVy = (Vy × Sa) + D(y-1) − OC
              
              
                Where:
                
                CSVy = Compliance sulfur value for year y, in ppm-gallons.
                Vy = Total gasoline volume produced or imported in year y, in gallons.
                Sa = Annual average sulfur level calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, in ppm (mg/kg).
                D(y-1) = Sulfur deficit from the previous reporting period, per § 80.1605, in ppm-gallons.
                OC = Sulfur credits obtained by the refinery or importer, in ppm-gallons.
              
              
              (2) Sulfur credits used in the calculation specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be used in accordance with the requirements at § 80.1616.

              (3) Compliance with the gasoline sulfur annual average standard at paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not achieved, and a deficit is created per § 80.1605, if for calendar year y, the compliance sulfur value is greater than 10 times the total gasoline volume produced or imported. The deficit value to be included in the following year's compliance calculation per paragraph (f) of this section is calculated as follows:
              
              Dy = CSVy − (Vy × 10y)
              
              
                Where:
                
                Dy = Sulfur deficit created in compliance period y, in ppm-gallons.

              § 80.1607
              Gasoline sulfur standards and requirements for transmix processors and transmix blenders.
              Transmix processors and transmix blenders may comply with the following sampling and testing requirements and standards instead of the sampling and testing requirements and standards otherwise applicable to a refiner under this subpart O.
              (a) Any transmix processor who recovers transmix gasoline product (TGP) from transmix through transmix processing under § 80.84(c) must show through sampling and testing (using the methods in § 80.1630) that the TGP meets the applicable sulfur standards under § 80.1604(b), prior to the TGP leaving the transmix processing facility.

              (b) The sampling and testing required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be conducted following each occasion TGP is produced.
              (c) Any transmix processor who produces gasoline by adding blendstock to TGP must, for such blendstock, comply with all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under this subpart O, and must meet the downstream sulfur standards under § 80.1604 for the gasoline produced by blending blendstock and TGP, prior to the gasoline leaving the transmix processing facility.
              (d) Any transmix processor who produces gasoline by blending blendstock into TGP must meet the sampling and testing requirements of this subpart O using one of the following methods:
              (1) Option 1. (i) Sample and test the blendstock that will be added to TGP during the compliance year when received at the transmix processing facility, using the methods specified in § 80.1630, to determine the volume and sulfur content, and treat each volume of blendstock that is blended into a volume of TGP as a separate batch for purposes of calculating and reporting compliance with the applicable annual average and per-gallon cap sulfur standards in § 80.1603.
              (ii) Use sulfur test results of the blendstock supplier provided that all the following requirements are met:
              (A) Sampling and testing by the blendstock supplier is performed using the methods specified in § 80.1630.
              (B) Testing for the sulfur content of the blendstock in the supplier's storage tank must be conducted following the last receipt of blendstock into the supplier's storage tank that supplies the transmix processor.
              (C) The transmix processor must obtain a copy of the blendstock supplier's test results, reflecting the sulfur content of each load of blendstock supplied to the transmix processor, at the time of each transfer of blendstock to the transmix processor.
              (D) The transmix processor must conduct a quality assurance program of sampling and testing for each blendstock supplier. The frequency of blendstock sampling and testing must be one sample for every 500,000 gallons of blendstock received or one sample every 3 months, whichever results in more frequent sampling.
              (iii) If any of the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section are not met, in whole or in part, for any blendstock blended into TGP, the gasoline produced with that blendstock is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur standards of this subpart O.
              (2) Option 2. (i) Sample and test each batch of TGP and determine the volume of the TGP.
              (ii) Sample and test the gasoline produced by blending blendstock into TGP, and determine its volume.
              (iii) Calculate the sulfur content and the volume of the batch by subtracting the volume and sulfur content of the TGP from the volume and sulfur content of the gasoline after blendstock blending. For purposes of compliance and reporting, the sulfur content shall be the calculated volume and sulfur content of the blendstock, and the applicable standards shall be the average and cap standards in § 80.1603. The applicable cap standard of the gasoline blend shall be the cap standard under § 80.1604.
              (iv) Tests shall be performed using the methods specified in § 80.1630, to determine the sulfur content of the batch.
              (v) The sulfur content of each batch of gasoline produced by blending blendstock into TGP must be no greater than the downstream sulfur standard under § 80.1604 applicable to the designation of the TGP.
              (e) Any transmix blender who produces gasoline by blending transmix, or mixtures of gasoline and distillate fuel described in § 80.84(e), into previously certified gasoline under § 80.84(d) must meet the applicable downstream sulfur standards under § 80.1604 for the gasoline produced by blending transmix and previously certified gasoline and the endpoint standard specified in § 80.84.
              (f) Any transmix processor or transmix blender who adds any feedstock to its transmix other than gasoline, distillate fuel, or gasoline blendstocks from pipeline interface must meet all requirements and standards that apply to a refiner under this subpart O for all gasoline it produces during a compliance period.

              (3) Credits may not be generated by transmix processors, producers or blenders of ethanol and other oxygenates, butane blenders using the flexibilities in § 80.82, or pentane blenders using the flexibilities in § 80.85.

              (b) Beginning with the 2014 annual averaging period, the number of credits generated for use in complying with the annual average standards of either subpart H of this part or § 80.1603(a) shall be calculated annually for each applicable averaging period according to the following equation (pursuant to § 80.310):
              
              CRa = Va × (SCredit − Sa)
              
              
                Where:
                
                CRa = Credits generated for the averaging period.
                Va = Total annual volume of gasoline produced at a refinery or imported during the averaging period.
                SCredit = 30.00 ppm.
                Sa = Actual annual average sulfur level, calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 80.205, for gasoline produced at a refinery or imported during the averaging period, exclusive of any credits. The value of Sa must be less than 30.00.
              
              

              (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, beginning with the 2017 annual averaging period, the number of credits generated for use in complying with the annual average standards of § 80.1603(c)(1) shall be calculated annually for each applicable averaging period according to the following equation:
              
              CRa = Va × (10 − Sa)
              
              
                Where:
                
                CRa = Credits generated for the averaging period for use in complying with the annual average standards of § 80.1603(a).
                Va = Total annual volume of gasoline produced at a refinery or imported during the averaging period.
                Sa = Actual annual average sulfur level, calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 80.1603(c)(1), for gasoline produced at a refinery or imported during the averaging period, exclusive of any credits. The value of Sa must be less than 10.00.
              
              
              (d) For approved small refiners and small volume refineries only, the number of credits generated from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019 shall be calculated annually for each applicable averaging period as follows:

              (1) From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, if a small refiner or small volume refinery has an annual average sulfur level (Sa) less than 30.00 ppm but greater than 10.00 ppm, the refiner may generate credits using the equation specified in paragraph (b) of this section for use in complying with the annual average standards of subpart H of this part.

              (2) From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, if a small refiner or small volume refinery has an annual average sulfur level (Sa) less than 10.00 ppm, the refiner may generate credits using the equation specified in paragraph (c) of this section for use in complying with the annual average standards of § 80.1603(c)(1) and the following equation for complying with the annual average standards of subpart H of this part:
              
              CRT2 = Va × (20.00)
              
              
                Where:
                
                CRT2 = Credits generated for the averaging period for use in complying with the annual average standards of subpart H of this part only.
                Va = Total annual volume of gasoline produced at a refinery or imported during the averaging period.
              
              

              (For example: A small refiner with an annual average sulfur level of 8 ppm in 2018 may generate CRa = 2 ppm-volume credits (10-8) for compliance with the annual average standards of § 80.1603(c)(1) plus CRT2 = 20 ppm-volume credits (30-10) for compliance with the annual average sulfur standards of subpart H of this part.)
              (3) Beginning January 1, 2020, small refiners and small volume refineries must follow paragraph (c) of this section for calculating credits under this subpart O.
              (e) No credits shall be generated—

              (1) Under paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section unless the value of CRa is positive.

              (2) Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section unless the value of CRT2 is positive.
              (f) The values of CRa and CRT2 shall be rounded to the nearest ppm-gallon in accordance with the rounding procedure specified in § 80.9.
              (g) A refiner or importer that includes downstream added oxygenates in its RFG or conventional gasoline volume under the provisions of §§ 80.69 and 80.101(d)(4), respectively and §§ 80.340 and 80.1603(d), shall include the downstream added oxygenate for the purpose of generating credits under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

              (b) Credit life. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, credits are valid for use for five years after the year in which they are generated.

              (2) Credits generated under § 80.1615(b) through (d) are valid for use for five years after the year in which they are generated, except that any CRa credits generated in 2015 and 2016 and any remaining CRT2 credits will expire and become invalid after December 31, 2019 (with the 2019 annual compliance report, due March 31, 2020).
              (3) A refiner or importer possessing credits must use all credits prior to falling into a compliance deficit.
              (4) In no case may a credit be transferred more than twice before being used or terminated.
              (c) Credit transfers. (1) Credits obtained from other refiners or importers may be used to meet the annual average standards of this subpart O, if all the following conditions are met:
              (i) The credits are generated and reported according to the requirements of this subpart O.
              (ii) The credits are used in compliance with the limitations regarding the appropriate periods for credit use pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

              (iii) Any credit transfer takes place by March 31 following the calendar year averaging period when the credits are used.
              (iv) The credit has not been transferred between EPA registered companies more than twice. The first transfer by the refiner or importer who generated the credit (“transferor”) may only be made to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit (“transferee”); if the transferee cannot use the credit, it may make the second, and final, transfer only to a refiner or importer who intends to use the credit. Credit transfers that occur within a company are unlimited.
              (v) The credit transferor must apply any credits necessary to meet the transferor's applicable average standard before transferring credits to any other refiner or importer.
              (vi) The credit transferor does not create a negative credit balance as a result of the credit transfer.
              (vii) Each transferor must supply to the transferee records indicating all the following:
              (A) The years the credits were generated.
              (B) The identity of the refiner or importer who generated the credits.
              (C) The identity of the transferring party (if it is not the same party that generated the credits).
              (2) In the case of credits that have been calculated or created improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, all the following provisions apply:
              (i) Invalid credits cannot be used to achieve compliance with the transferee's averaging standard, regardless of the transferee's good faith belief that the credits were valid.
              (ii) The refiner or importer who used the credits, and any transferor of the credits, must adjust their credit records and reports and sulfur calculations as necessary to reflect the proper credits.
              (iii) Any properly created credits existing in the transferor's credit balance after correcting the credit balance, and after the transferor applies credits as needed to meet the average standard at the end of the compliance year, must first be applied to correct the invalid transfers before the transferor trades or banks the credits.
              (3) CRT2 credits generated under § 80.1615(d) from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019 may only be traded to and ultimately used from January 1, 2017 through December 31 by small refiners and small volume refineries approved under § 80.1622.

              § 80.1625
              Hardship provisions.
              EPA may, at its discretion, grant a refiner of gasoline that processes crude oil through refinery processing units, for one or more of its refineries, temporary relief from some or all of the provisions of this subpart.
              (a) Extreme hardship circumstances. (1) EPA may, at its discretion, grant a refiner of gasoline that processes crude oil through refinery processing units, for one or more of its refineries, temporary relief from some or all of the provisions of this subpart. EPA may grant such relief provided that the refiner demonstrates all the following:
              (i) Unusual circumstances exist that impose extreme hardship and significantly affect the refiner's ability to comply by the applicable date.
              (ii) It has made best efforts to comply with the requirements of this subpart.
              (2) The application must specify the factors that demonstrate a significant economic hardship and must provide a detailed discussion regarding the inability of the refinery to produce gasoline meeting the requirements of § 80.1603. Such an application must include, at a minimum, all the following information:
              (i) Documentation of efforts made to obtain necessary financing, including all the following:
              (A) Copies of loan applications for the necessary financing of the construction of appropriate sulfur reduction technology and other equipment procurements or improvements.
              (B) If financing has been disapproved or is otherwise unsuccessful, documents supporting the basis for that disapproval and evidence of efforts to pursue other means of financing.
              (ii) A detailed analysis of the reasons the refinery is unable to produce gasoline meeting the standards of this subpart O in 2017, including costs, specification of equipment still needed, potential equipment suppliers, and efforts already completed to obtain the necessary equipment.

              (iii) If unavailability of equipment is part of the reason for the inability to comply, a discussion of other options considered, and the reasons these other options are not feasible.
              (iv) If relevant, a demonstration that a needed or lower cost technology is immediately unavailable, but will be available in the near future, and full information regarding when and from what sources it will be available.
              (v) Schematic drawings of the refinery configuration as of January 1, 2011, and as of the date of the hardship extension application, and any planned future additions or changes.
              (vi) If relevant, a demonstration that a temporary unavailability exists of engineering or construction resources necessary for design or installation of the needed equipment.
              (vii) A detailed analysis of the reasons the refinery is unable to use credits to meet the gasoline standards of this subpart O, including all avenues pursued to generate and/or procure credits, their cost, and ability to finance them.
              (viii) A discussion of any sulfur reductions that can be achieved from current levels.
              (ix) The date the refiner anticipates compliance with the standards in § 80.1603 can be achieved at its refinery.
              (x) An analysis of the economic impact of compliance on the refiner's business (including financial statements from the last 5 years, or for any time period up to 10 years, at EPA's request).
              (xi) Any other information regarding other strategies considered, including strategies or components of strategies that do not involve installation of equipment, and why meeting the standards in § 80.1603 beginning in 2017 (or 2020 for approved small refiners and small volume refineries) is infeasible.
              (3) Hardship applications under this paragraph (a) must be submitted to EPA by January 1, 2016 to the address listed in paragraph (d) of this section.
              (b) Extreme unforeseen circumstances hardship. (1) In appropriate extreme, unusual, and unforeseen circumstances (for example, natural disaster or refinery fire) which are clearly outside the control of the refiner or importer and which could not have been avoided by the exercise of prudence, diligence, and due care, EPA may permit a refiner or importer, for a brief period, to distribute gasoline which does not meet the requirements of this subpart for all the following reasons:
              (i) It is in the public interest to do so (e.g., distribution of the nonconforming gasoline is necessary to meet projected shortfalls which cannot otherwise be compensated for).
              (ii) The refiner or importer exercised prudent planning and was not able to avoid the violation and has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of the nonconformity.
              (iii) The refiner or importer can show how the requirements for making compliant gasoline, and/or purchasing credits to partially or completely offset the nonconformity, will be expeditiously achieved.
              (iv) The refiner or importer agrees to make up any air quality detriment associated with the nonconforming gasoline, where practicable.
              (v) The refiner or importer pays to the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to the economic benefit of the nonconformity minus the amount expended pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, in making up the air quality detriment.
              (2) The hardship application must meet all other applicable requirements of this section, except paragraph (a) of this section.
              (c) Applications. (1) The hardship extension application must contain a letter signed by the president or the chief operating officer or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the application is true to the best of his/her knowledge.
              (2) Hardship applications under this section must be submitted in writing to the following address: U.S. EPA—Attn: Tier 3 Program (Hardship Application), 6406J, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20460.

              § 80.1630
              Sampling and testing requirements for refiners, gasoline importers and producers and importers of certified ethanol denaturant.
              (a) Sample and test each batch of gasoline and certified ethanol denaturant. (1) Refiners and importers shall collect a representative sample from each batch of gasoline produced or imported and test each sample to determine its sulfur content for compliance with requirements under this subpart prior to the gasoline leaving the refinery or import facility, using the sampling and testing methods provided in this section or §§ 80.8 (sampling) and 80.47 (testing).
              (2) Producers and importers of certified ethanol denaturant shall collect a representative sample from each batch of certified ethanol denaturant produced or imported and test each sample to determine its sulfur content for compliance with requirements under this subpart prior to the certified ethanol denaturant leaving the certified ethanol denaturant production or import facility, using the sampling and testing methods provided in this section or §§ 80.8 (sampling) and 80.47 (testing).
              (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the requirements of this section apply beginning January 1, 2017 for gasoline refiners and importers. For producers and importers of certified ethanol denaturants, the requirements of this section apply beginning January 1, 2017, or the first date that certified ethanol denaturant is introduced into commerce, whichever is earlier.
              (4)(i) Beginning January 1, 2017, any refiner who produces gasoline using computer-controlled in-line blending equipment is exempt from the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section to obtain the test results required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section prior to the gasoline leaving the refinery, provided that the refiner obtains an exemption from this requirement from EPA. To obtain such exemption, the refiner must—
              (A) Have been granted an in-line blending exemption under § 80.65(f)(4); or
              (B) If the refiner has not been granted an exemption under § 80.65(f)(4), submit to EPA all of the information required under § 80.65(f)(4)(i)(A). A letter signed by the president, chief operating officer or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B).
              (ii) Refiners who seek an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section must comply with any EPA request for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption.
              (iii) Within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a submission under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section, EPA will notify the refiner if the exemption is not approved or of any deficiencies in the refiner's submission, or if any additional information is required or other requirements are included in the exemption pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. In the absence of such notification from EPA, the effective date of an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for refiners who do not hold an exemption under § 80.65(f)(4) is 60 days from EPA's receipt of the refiner's submission under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(B) of this section.

              (iv) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the refiner's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the sulfur content of the refinery's gasoline production, or if EPA determines that any other circumstances exist which merit modification of the requirements of an exemption, such as advancements in the state of the art for in-line blending measurement which allow for additional control or more accurate monitoring or documentation of sulfur content. If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the refiner's exemption will be void ab initio.
              
              (b) Sampling methods. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, refiners, gasoline importers, and producers and importers of certified ethanol denaturant shall sample each batch of gasoline by using one of the methods specified in § 80.8. Alternative methods for sampling batches of certified ethanol denaturant may be used as approved by the Administrator.
              
              (c) Test method for measuring sulfur content of gasoline and certified ethanol denaturant. (1) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, refiners, gasoline importers, and producers and importers of certified ethanol denaturant shall use the method provided in § 80.47, as applicable, to measure the sulfur content of gasoline or certified ethanol denaturant they produce or import.
              (2) Sulfur content shall be reported to the nearest ppm.
              (3) Alternative methods for the measurement of the sulfur content of certified ethanol denaturants may be used as approved by the Administrator.
            
            
              § 80.1631
              Gasoline, RBOB, and CBOB sample retention requirements.
              (a) Sample retention requirements. Beginning January 1, 2017, or January 1 of the first year credits are generated under § 80.1615, whichever is earlier, any refiner or importer shall do all the following:
              (1) Collect a representative portion of each sample analyzed under § 80.1630, of at least 330 milliliters in volume.
              (2) Retain sample portions for the most recent 20 samples collected, or for each sample collected during the most recent 21 day period, whichever is greater, not to exceed 90 days for any given sample.
              (3) Comply with the gasoline sample handling and storage procedures under § 80.1630 for each sample portion retained.
              (4) Comply with any request by EPA to—
              (i) Provide a retained sample portion to the Administrator's authorized representative; and
              (ii) Ship a retained sample portion to EPA, within two working days of the date of the request, by an overnight shipping service or comparable means, to the address and following procedures specified by EPA, and accompanied with the sulfur test result for the sample determined under § 80.1630.
              (b) Sample retention requirement for samples subject to independent analysis requirements. (1) Any refiner or importer who meets the independent analysis requirements under § 80.65(f) for any batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB will have met the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, provided the independent laboratory meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the gasoline batch; except that the retained RBOB sample for purposes of this subpart O must be a sample of the RBOB prior to hand blending with oxygenate.
              (2) For samples retained by an independent laboratory under this paragraph (b), the test results required to be submitted under paragraph (a) of this section shall be the test results determined under § 80.65(e).
              (c) Sampling compliance certification. Any refiner or importer shall include with each annual report filed under § 80.1652, the following statement, which must accurately reflect the facts and must be signed and dated by the same person who signs the annual report:
              I certify that I have made inquiries that are sufficient to give me knowledge of the procedures to collect and store gasoline samples, and I further certify that the procedures meet the requirements of the ASTM procedures required under 40 CFR 80.1630.
              (d) Requirements for refiners who analyze composited samples. Prior to January 1, 2017, for purposes of complying with the requirements of this section, refiners who analyze composited samples under § 80.1630 must retain portions of the composited samples. Portions of samples of each batch comprising the composited samples are not required to be retained.
              (e) Requirements for RBOB. For purposes of complying with the requirements of this section for RBOB, a sample of each RBOB batch produced must be retained.

              § 80.1640
              Standards and requirements that apply to refiners producing gasoline by blending blendstocks into previously certified gasoline (PCG).
              (a) Any refiner who produces gasoline by blending blendstock into PCG, as defined at § 80.2(d), must meet the requirements of § 80.1630 to sample and test every batch of gasoline as follows:

              (1) Exclude the PCG for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the sulfur standards of this subpart O.
              
              (2) To accomplish the exclusion required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the refiner must determine the volume and sulfur content of the PCG used at the refinery and the volume and sulfur content of the gasoline produced at the refinery, and use the compliance calculation procedures in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section.
              (3) For each batch of PCG that is used to produce gasoline the refiner must include the volume and sulfur content of the PCG as a negative volume and a positive sulfur content in the refiner's compliance calculations in accord with the requirements at § 80.1603.
              (4) For each batch of gasoline produced at the refinery using PCG and blendstock, the refiner must determine the volume and sulfur content of the combined product and include each batch of combined product for purposes of sulfur compliance in the refinery's compliance calculations at § 80.1603 without regard to the presence of previously certified gasoline in the batch.
              (5) The refiner must use any PCG that it includes as a negative batch in its compliance calculations pursuant to § 80.1603 as a component in gasoline production during the annual averaging period in which the PCG was included as a negative batch in the refiner's compliance calculations.
              (6) The refiner must also comply with § 80.65(i) when producing RBOB or RFG and § 80.101(g)(9) when producing conventional gasoline or CBOB.
              (7) Any negative annual average sulfur value shall be reported as zero and not as a negative result.
              (b) In the alternative, a refiner may sample and test each batch of blendstock when received at the refinery to determine the volume and sulfur content, and treat each blendstock receipt as a separate batch for purposes of compliance calculations for the annual average sulfur standard and for reporting. This alternative applies only if every batch of blendstock used at a refinery during an averaging period has a sulfur content that is equal to, or less than, the applicable per-gallon cap standard under § 80.1603.
              (c) Refiners who blend only butane into PCG may meet the sampling and testing requirements of this subpart O for sulfur by using sulfur test results of the butane supplier, provided that the requirements of § 80.82 are met.
              (d) Refiners who blend only blender grade pentane into PCG may meet the sampling and testing requirements of this subpart O for sulfur by using sulfur test results of the pentane supplier, provided that the requirements of § 80.85 are met.

              § 80.1641
              Alternative sulfur standards and requirements that apply to importers who transport gasoline by truck.
              Importers who import gasoline into the United States by truck may comply with the following requirements instead of the requirements to sample and test every batch of gasoline under § 80.1630, and the annual sulfur average and per-gallon cap standards otherwise applicable to importers under § 80.1603:
              (a) Alternative standards. The imported gasoline must comply with the following standards:
              (1) The annual average standard of 10 ppm and the per-gallon standard of 80 ppm as provided by § 80.1603; or
              (2) A per-gallon standard of 10 ppm.
              (b) Terminal testing. The importer may use test results for sulfur content testing conducted by the terminal operator, for gasoline contained in the storage tank from which trucks used to transport gasoline into the United States are loaded, for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the standards in paragraph (a) of this section, provided all the following conditions are met:
              (1) The sampling and testing shall be performed after each receipt of gasoline into the storage tank, or immediately before each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck.
              (2) The sampling and testing shall be performed using the methods specified in §§ 80.8 and 80.47, respectively.

              (3) At the time of each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck for import to the United States, the importer must obtain a copy of the terminal test result that indicates the sulfur content of the truck load (or each compartment if fuel was loaded from different storage tanks).
              
              (c) Quality assurance program. The importer must conduct a quality assurance program for each truck loading terminal as follows:
              (1) Quality assurance samples must be obtained from the truck-loading terminal and tested by the importer, or by an independent laboratory, and the terminal operator must not know in advance when samples are to be collected.
              (2) The sampling and testing must be performed using the methods specified in §§ 80.8 and 80.47, respectively.

              (3) The quality assurance test results for sulfur must differ from the terminal test result by no more than the ASTM reproducibility of the terminal's test results, as determined by the following equation:
              
              R = 105 × ((S + 2) / 104) 0.4
              
              
                Where:
                
                R = ASTM reproducibility.
                S = Sulfur content based on the terminal's test result.
              
              
              (4) The frequency of the quality assurance sampling and testing must be at least one sample for each fifty of an importer's trucks that are loaded at a terminal, or one sample per month, whichever is more frequent.
              (d) Party required to conduct quality assurance testing. The quality assurance program under paragraph (c) of this section shall be conducted by the importer. In the alternative, this testing may be conducted by an independent laboratory that meets the criteria under § 80.65(f)(2)(iii), provided the importer receives, no later than 21 days after the sample was taken, copies of all results of tests conducted.
              (e) Assignment of batch numbers. The importer must treat each truckload of imported gasoline as a separate batch for purposes of reporting under § 80.1652 and assigning batch numbers and maintaining records under § 80.1653.
              (f) EPA inspections of terminals. EPA inspectors or auditors, and auditors conducting attest engagements under § 80.1667, must be given full and immediate access to the truck-loading terminal and any laboratory at which samples of gasoline collected at the terminal are analyzed, and must be allowed to conduct inspections, review records, collect gasoline samples, and perform audits. These inspections or audits may be either announced or unannounced.
              (g) Certified Sulfur-FRGAS. This section does not apply to Certified Sulfur-FRGAS.
              (h) Reporting requirements. Any importer who elects to comply with the alternative standards in paragraph (a) of this section shall comply with all the following requirements:
              (1) All importer recordkeeping and reporting requirements under §§ 80.1652 and 80.1653, except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
              (2) An importer who elects to comply with the alternative standards in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must certify in the annual report whether it is in compliance with the applicable per-gallon batch standard set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in lieu of providing the information required by § 80.1652 regarding annual average sulfur content and compliance with the average standard under § 80.1603.
              (i) Effect of noncompliance. If any of the requirements of this section are not met, all gasoline imported by the truck importer during the time any requirements are not met is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur average and per-gallon cap standards in § 80.1603. Additionally, if any requirement is not met, EPA may notify the importer of the violation and, if the requirement is not fulfilled within 10 days of notification, the truck importer may not in the future use the sampling and testing provisions in this section in lieu of the provisions in § 80.1630.
            
            
              § 80.1642
              Sampling and testing requirements for producers and importers of denatured fuel ethanol and other oxygenates for use by oxygenate blenders.
              Beginning January 1, 2017, producers and importers of denatured fuel ethanol (DFE) and other oxygenates for use by oxygenate blenders must satisfy the sampling and testing requirements in this section prior to the addition of the oxygenate to gasoline or blendstocks for oxygenate blending.
              (a) Sampling requirements. Producers and importers of oxygenates for use by oxygenate blenders shall collect a representative sample from each batch of oxygenate produced or imported prior to the oxygenate leaving the oxygenate production or import facility, using the sampling methods specified in § 80.8 or § 80.47.
              (b) Determination of oxygenate sulfur content. Producers and importers of oxygenates must test each batch of oxygenate they produce or import to determine its sulfur content to the nearest ppm using a test method provided in § 80.47, or, with respect to DFE may use the alternative means of determining the sulfur content contained in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Alternative means of determining the sulfur content of DFE. As an alternative to testing each batch of DFE pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the sulfur content of batches of DFE produced using certified denaturant meeting the requirements of § 80.1611 may be determined as follows:
              (1) The sulfur content of the batch of DFE shall be calculated by volume weighting the sulfur contribution from the denaturant, and the neat ethanol used.
              (2) The sulfur content of the neat (un-denatured) ethanol used in the calculation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be assumed to be negligible or assumed to be some specific value for the purposes of calculating the sulfur content of the DFE batch provided that the DFE manufacturer or importer conducts production quality control which demonstrates that such an assumption is valid. Otherwise, the sulfur content of the neat ethanol must be determined in accordance with the test requirements of § 80.1630.
              (3) The sulfur content of the certified denaturant used in the calculation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be consistent with the PTD obtained from a registered certified ethanol denaturant producer or importer in accordance with the requirements of § 80.1611. If the PTD from the certified ethanol denaturant states that the sulfur content is 330 ppm, then the sulfur content of the sulfur content of the ethanol denaturant must be assumed to be 330 ppm.
              (4) A sample of each batch of DFE must be retained pursuant to the requirements of § 80.1643.
              (5) The sulfur content of each batch of DFE shall be reported to the nearest ppm.

              5.1 Purity of Reagents—Reagent grade chemicals shall be used in all tests. Unless otherwise indicated, it is intended that all reagents shall conform to the specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society, where such specifications are available. Other grades may be used, provided it is first ascertained that the reagent is of sufficiently high purity to permit its use without lessening the accuracy of the determination.
              5.2 Purity of Water—Unless otherwise indicated, references to water shall be understood to mean distilled water or water of equal purity.

              5.3 Ammonium Molybdate Solution—Using graduated cylinders for measurement add slowly (Note 2), with continuous stirring, 225 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to 500 ml of water contained in a beaker placed in a bath of cold water. Cool to room temperature and add 20 g of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6 Mo7 O24·4H2 O). Stir until solution is complete and transfer to a 1000-ml flask. Dilute to the mark with water.
              
              
                Note 2:
                Wear a face shield, rubber gloves, and a rubber apron when adding concentrated sulfuric acid to water.
              
              

              5.4 Hydrazine Sulfate Solution—Dissolve 1.5 of hydrazine sulfate (H2 NNH2· H2 SO4) in 1 litre of water, measured with a graduated cylinder.
              
              
                Note 3:
                This solution is not stable. Keep it tightly stoppered and in the dark. Prepare a fresh solution after 3 weeks.
              
              

              5.5 Molybdate-Hydrazine Reagent—Pipet 25 ml of ammonium molybdate solution into a 100-ml volumetric flask containing approximately 50 ml of water, add by pipet 10 ml of N2 NNH2· H2 SO4 solution, and dilute to 100 ml with water.
              
              
                Note 4:
                This reagent is unstable and should be used within about 4 h. Prepare it immediately before use. Each determination (including the blank) uses 50 ml.
              
              
              5.6 Phosphorus, Standard Solution (10.0 µg P/ml)—Pipet 10 ml of stock standard phosphorus solution into a 1000-ml volumetric flask and dilute to the mark with water.

              5.7 Phosphorus, Stock Standard Solution (1.00 mg P/ml)—Dry approximately 5 g of potasium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2 PO4 in an oven at 221 to 230 °F (105 to 110 °C) for 3 h. Dissolve 4.393 ±0.002 g of the reagent in 150 ml, measured with a graduated cylinder, of H2 SO4(1 + 10) contained in a 1000-ml volumetric flask. Dilute with water to the mark.

              5.8 Sulfuric Acid (1 + 10)—Using graduated cylinders for measurement add slowly (Note 2), with continuous stirring, 100-ml of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2 SO4, sp gr 1.84) to 1 litre of water contained in a beaker placed in a bath of cold water.
              5.9 Zinc Oxide.
              
              
                Note 5:
                High-bulk density zinc oxide may cause spattering. Density of approximately 0.5 g/cm 3 has been found satisfactory.
              
              6. Calibration.
              6.1 Transfer by buret, or a volumetric transfer pipet, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 ml of phosphorus standard solution into 100-ml volumetric flasks.
              6.2 Pipet 10 ml of H2 SO4 (1 + 10) into each flask. Mix immediately by swirling.
              6.3 Prepare the molybdate-hydrazine solution. Prepare sufficient volume of reagent based on the number of samples being analyzed.
              6.4 Pipet 50 ml of the molybdate-hydrazine solution to each volumetric flask. Mix immediately by swirling.
              6.5 Dilute to 100 ml with water.
              6.6 Mix well and place in the constant-temperature bath so that the contents of the flask are submerged below the level of the bath. Maintain bath temperature at 180 to 190 °F (82.2 to 87.8 °C) for 25 min (Note 1).

              6.7 Transfer the flask to the cooling bath and cool the contents rapidly to room temperature. Do not allow the samples to cool more than 5 °F (2.8 °C) below room temperature.
              
              
                Note 6:
                Place a chemically clean thermometer in one of the flasks to check the temperature.
              
              
              6.8 After cooling the flasks to room temperature, remove them from the cooling water bath and allow them to stand for 10 min. at room temperature.
              6.9 Using the 2.0-ml phosphorus standard in a 5-cm cell, determine the wavelength near 820 nm that gives maximum absorbance. The wavelength giving maximum absorbance should not exceed 830 nm.
              6.9.1 Using a red-sensitive phototube and 5-cm cells, adjust the spectrophotometer to zero absorbance at the wavelength of maximum absorbance using distilled water in both cells. Use the wavelength of maximum absorbance in the determination of calibration readings and future sample readings.
              6.9.2 The use of 1-cm cells for the higher concentrations is permissible.

              6.10 Measure the absorbance of each calibration sample including the blank (0.0 ml phosphorus standard) at the wavelength of maximum absorbance with distilled water in the reference cell.
              
              
                Note 7:
                Great care must be taken to avoid possible contamination. If the absorbance of the blank exceeds 0.04 (for 5-cm cell), check for source of contamination. It is suggested that the results be disregarded and the test be rerun with fresh reagents and clean glassware.
              
              
              6.11 Correct the absorbance of each standard solution by subtracting the absorbance of the blank (0 ml phosphorus standard).
              6.12 Prepare a calibration curve by plotting the corrected absorbance of each standard solution against micrograms of phosphorus. One millilitre of phosphorus standard solution provides 10 µg of phosphorus.
              7. Sampling.

              7.1 Selection of the size of the sample to be tested depends on the expected concentration of phosphorous in the sample. If a concentration of phosphorus is suspected to be less than 0.0038 g/gal (1.0 mg/litre), it will be necessary to use 10 ml of sample.
              
              
                Note 8:
                Two grams of zinc oxide cannot absorb this volume of gasoline. Therefore the 10-ml sample is ignited in aliquots of 2 ml in the presence of 2 g of zinc oxide.
              
              

              7.2 The following table serves as a guide for selecting sample size:
              
              
                
                  Phosphorus, milligrams per liter
                  Equivalent, grams per gallon
                  Sample size, milliliter
                
                
                  2.5 to 40
                  0.01 to 0.15
                  1.00
                
                
                  1.3 to 20
                  0.005 to 0.075
                  2.00
                
                
                  0.9 to 13
                  0.0037 to 0.05
                  3.00
                
                
                  1 or less
                  0.0038 or less
                  10.00
                
              
              8. Procedure.

              8.1 Transfer 2 ±0.2 g of zinc oxide into a conical pile in a clean, dry, unetched ignition dish.
              
              
                Note 9:
                In order to obtain satisfactory accuracy with the small amounts of phosphorus involved, it is necessary to take extensive precautions in handling. The usual precautions of cleanliness, careful manipulation, and avoidance of contamination should be scrupulously observed; also, all glassware should be cleaned before use, with cleaning acid or by some procedure that does not involve use of commercial detergents. These compounds often contain alkali phosphates which are strongly adsorbed by glass surfaces and are not removed by ordinary rinsing. It is desirable to segregate a special stock of glassware for use only in the determination of phosphorus.
              
              
              8.2 Make a deep depression in the center of the zinc oxide pile with a stirring rod.

              8.3 Pipet the gasoline sample (Note 10) (see 7.2 for suggested sample volume) into the depression in the zinc oxide. Record the temperature of the fuel if the phosphorus content is required at 60 °F (15.6 °C) and make correction as directed in 9.2.
              
              
                Note 10:
                For the 10-ml sample use multiple additions and a syringe. Hold the tip of the needle at approximately 2/3 of the depth of the zinc oxide layer and slowly deliver 2 ml of the sample: fast sample delivery may give low results. Give sufficient time for the gasoline to be absorbed by the zinc oxide. Follow step 8.6. Cool the dish to room temperature. Repeat steps 8.3 and 8.6 until all the sample has been burned. Safety—cool the ignition dish before adding the additional aliquots of gasoline to avoid a flash fire.
              
              
              8.4 Cover the sample with a small amount of fresh zinc oxide from reagent bottle (use the tip of a small spatula to deliver approximately 0.2 g). Tap the sides of the ignition dish to pack the zinc oxide.
              8.5 Prepare the blank, using the same amount of zinc oxide in an ignition dish.

              8.6 Ignite the gasoline, using the flame from a bunsen burner. Allow the gasoline to burn to extinction (Note 10).

              8.7 Place the ignition dishes containing the sample and blank in a hot muffle furnace set at a temperature of 1150 to 1300 °F (621 to 704 °C) for 10 min. Remove and cool the ignition dishes. When cool gently tap the sides of the dish to loosen the zinc oxide. Again place the dishes in the muffle furnace for 5 min. Remove and cool the ignition dishes to room temperature. The above treatment is usually sufficient to burn the carbon. If the carbon is not completely burned off place the dish into the oven for further 5-min. periods.
              
              
                Note 11:
                Step 8.7 may also be accomplished by heating the ignition dish with a Meker burner gradually increasing the intensity of heat until the carbon from the sides of the dish has been burned, then cool to room temperature.
              
              
              8.8 Pipet 25 ml of H2 SO4 (1 + 10) to each ignition dish. While pipeting, carefully wash all traces of zinc oxide from the sides of the ignition dish.
              8.9 Cover the ignition dish with a borosilicate watch glass and warm the ignition dish on a hot plate until the zinc oxide is completely dissolved.
              8.10 Transfer the solution through filter paper to a 100-ml volumetric flask. Rinse the watch glass and the dish several times with distilled water (do not exceed 25 ml) and transfer the washings through the filter paper to the volumetric flask.
              8.11 Prepare the molybdate-hydrazine solution.
              8.12 Add 50 ml of the molybdate-hydrazine solution by pipet to each 100-ml volumetric flask. Mix immediately by swirling.
              8.13 Dilute to 100 ml with water and mix well. Remove stoppers from flasks after mixing.

              8.14 Place the 100-ml flasks in the constant-temperature bath for 25 min. so that the contents of the flasks are below the liquid level of the bath. The temperature of the bath should be 180 to 190 °F (82.2 to 87.8 °C) (Note 1).

              8.15 Transfer the 100-ml flasks to the cooling bath and cool the contents rapidly to room temperature (Note 6).

              8.16 Allow the samples to stand at room temperature before measuring the absorbance.
              
              
                Note 12:
                The color developed is stable for at least 4 h.
              
              
              8.17 Set the spectrophotometer to the wavelength of maximum absorbance as determined in 6.9. Adjust the spectrophotometer to zero absorbance, using distilled water in both cells.
              8.18 Measure the absorbance of the samples at the wavelength of maximum absorbance with distilled water in the reference cell.

              8.19 Subtract the absorbance of the blank from the absorbance of each sample (Note 7).
              8.20 Determine the micrograms of phosphorous in the sample, using the calibration curve from 6.12 and the corrected absorbance.
              9. Calculations.

              9.1 Calculate the milligrams of phosphorus per litre of sample as follows:
                
              
              P, mg/litre = P/V
              
              where:
              
              P = micrograms of phosphorus read from calibration curve, and
              V = millilitres of gasoline sample.
              
              To convert to grams of phosphorus per U.S. gallon of sample, multiply mg P/litre by 0.0038.

              9.2 If the gasoline sample was taken at a temperature other than 60 °F (15.6 °C) make the following temperature correction:
              
              mg P/litre at 15.6 °C = [mg P/litre at t] [1 + 0.001 (t−15.6)]
              
              where:
              
              t = observed temperature of the gasoline, °C.
              
              9.3 Concentrations below 2.5 mg/litre or 0.01 g/gal should be reported to the nearest 0.01 mg/litre or 0.0001 g/U.S. gal.
              9.3.1 For higher concentrations, report results to the nearest 1 mg P/litre or 0.005 g P/U.S. gal.
              10. Precision.
              10.1 The following criteria should be used for judging the acceptability of results (95 percent confidence):
              10.2 Repeatability—Duplicate results by the same operator should be considered suspect if they differ by more than the following amounts:
              
                
                  g P/U.S. gal (mg·P/litre)
                  Repeatability
                
                
                  0.0008 to 0.005 (0.2 to 1.3)
                  0.0002 g P/U.S. gal (0.05 mg P/litre).
                
                
                  0.005 to 0.15 (1.3 to 40)
                  7% of the mean.
                
              
              10.3 Reproducibility—The results submitted by each of two laboratories should not be considered suspect unless they differ by more than the following amounts:
              
                
                  g P/U.S. gal (mg·P/litre)

              Appendix B to Part 80—Test Methods for Lead in Gasoline
              Method 1—Standard Method Test for Lead in Gasoline by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry
              1. Scope.
              1.1. This method covers the determination of the total lead content of gasoline. The procedure's calibration range is 0.010 to 0.10 gram of lead/U.S. gal. Samples above this level should be diluted to fall within this range or a higher level calibration standard curve must be prepared. The higher level curve must be shown to be linear and measurement of lead at these levels must be shown to be accurate by the analysis of control samples at a higher level of alkyl lead content. The method compensates for variations in gasoline composition and is independent of lead alkyl type.
              2. Summary of method.
              2.1 The gasoline sample is diluted with methyl isobutyl ketone and the alkyl lead compounds are stabilized by reaction with iodine and a quarternary ammonium salt. The lead content of the sample is determined by atomic absorption flame spectrometry at 2833 A, using standards prepared from reagent grade lead chloride. By the use of this treatment, all alkyl lead compounds give identical response.
              3. Apparatus.
              3.1 Atomic Absorption Spectometer, capable of scale expansion and nebulizer adjustment, and equipped with a slot burner and premix chamber for use with an air-acetylene flame.
              3.2 Volumetric Flasks, 50-ml, 100-ml, 250-ml, and one litre sizes.
              3.3 Pipets, 2-ml, 5-ml, 10-ml, 20-ml, and 50-ml sizes.
              3.4 Micropipet, 100-µl, Eppendorf type or equivalent.
              4. Reagents.
              4.1 Purity of Reagents—Reagent grade chemicals shall be used in all tests. Unless otherwise indicated, it is intended that all reagents shall conform to the specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society, where such specifications are available. Other grades may be used, provided it is first ascertained that the reagent is of sufficiently high purity to permit its use without lessening the accuracy of the determination.
              4.2 Purity of Water—Unless otherwise indicated, references to water shall be understood to mean distilled water or water of equal purity.
              4.3 Aliquat 336 (tricapryl methyl ammonium chloride).
              4.4 Aliquat 336/MIBK Solution (10 percent v/v)—Dissolve and dilute 100 ml (88.0 g) of Aliquat 336 with MIBK to one liter.

              4.9 Lead, Standard Solution (5.0 g Pb/gal)—Dissolve 0.4433 g of lead chloride (PbCl2) previously dried at 105 °C for 3 h in about 200 ml of 10 percent Aliquat 336/MIBK solution in a 250-ml volumetric flask. Dilute to the mark with the 10 percent Aliquat solution, mix, and store in a brown bottle having a polyethylene-lined cap. This solution contains 1,321 µg Pb/ml, which is equivalent to 5.0 g Pb/gal.
              4.10 Lead, Standard Solution (1.0 g Pb/gal)—By means of a pipet, accurately transfer 50.0 ml of the 5.0 g Pb/gal solution to a 250-ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume with 1 percent Aliquat/MIBK solution. Store in a brown bottle having a polyethylene-lined cap.
              4.11 Lead, Standard Solutions (0.02, 0.05, and 0.10 g Pb/gal)—Transfer accurately by means of pipets 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 ml of the 1.0-g Pb/gal solution to 100-ml volumetric flasks; add 5.0 ml of 1 percent Aliquat 336 solution to each flask; dilute to the mark with MIBK. Mix well and store in bottles having polyethylene-lined caps.

              5.1.1 To each of four 50-ml volumetric flasks containing 30 ml of MIBK, add 5.0 ml of low lead standard solution and 5.0 ml of lead-free gasoline. In the case of the blank, add only 5.0 ml of lead-free gasoline.
              5.1.2 Add immediately 0.1 ml of iodine/toluene solution by means of the 100-µl Eppendorf pipet. Mix well. 1
                
              
              
                
                  1 EPA practice will be to mix well by shaking vigorously for approximately one minute.

              5.2 Preparation of Instrument—Optimize the atomic absorption equipment for lead at 2833 A. Using the reagent blank, adjust the gas mixture and the sample aspiration rate to obtain an oxidizing flame.
              5.2.1 Aspirate the 0.1-g Pb/gal working standard and adjust the burner position to give maximum response. Some instruments require the use of scale expansion to produce a reading of 0.150 to 0.170 for this standard.
              5.2.2 Aspirate the reagent blank to zero the instrument and check the absorbances of the three working standards for linearity.
              6. Procedure.
              6.1 To a 50 ml volumetric flask containing 30 ml MIBK, add 5.0 ml of gasoline sample and mix. 2
                
              
              
                
                  2 The gasoline should be allowed to come to room temperature (25 °C).
              
              6.1.1 Add 0.10 ml (100 µl) of iodine/toluene solution and allow the mixture to react about 1 minute. 3
                
              
              
                
                  3 See footnote 1 of section 5.1.2.
              
              6.1.2 Add 5.0 ml of 1 percent Aliquot 336/MIBK solution and mix.
              6.1.3 Dilute to volume with MIBK and mix.
              6.2 Aspirate the samples and working standards and record the absorbance values with frequent checks of the zero.
              6.3 Any sample resulting in a peak greater than 0.05 g Pb/gal will be run in duplicate. Samples registering greater than 0.10 g Pb/gal should be diluted with iso-octane or unleaded fuel to fall within the calibration range or a higher level calibration standard curve must be prepared. The higher level curve must be shown to be linear and measurement of lead at these levels must be shown to be accurate by the analysis of control samples at a higher level of alkyl lead content.
              7. Calculations.
              7.1 Plot the absorbance values versus concentration represented by the working standards and read the concentrations of the samples from the graph.
              8. Precision.
              8.1 The following criteria should be used for judging the acceptability of results (95 percent confidence):
              8.1.1 Repeatability—Duplicate results by the same operator should be considered suspect if they differ by more than 0.005 g/gal.
              8.1.2 Reproductibility—The results submitted by each of two laboratories should not be considered suspect unless the two results differ by more than 0.01 g/gal.
              Method 2—Automated Method Test for Lead in Gasoline by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry
              1. Scope and application.
              1.1 This method covers the determination of the total lead content of gasoline. The procedure's calibration range is 0.010 to 0.10 gram of lead/U.S. gal. Samples above this level should be diluted to fall within this range or a higher level calibration standard curve must be prepared. The higher level curve must be shown to be linear and measurement of lead at these levels must be shown to be accurate by the analysis of control samples at a higher level of alkyl lead content. The method compensates for variations in gasoline composition and is independent of lead alkyl type.

              1.2 This method may be used as an alternative to the Standard Method set forth above.
              
              1.3 Where trade names or specific products are noted in the method, equivalent apparatus and chemical reagents may be used. Mention of trade names or specific products is for the assistance of the user and does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
              2. Summary of method.
              2.1 The gasoline sample is diluted with methly isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and the alkyl lead compounds are stabilized by reacting with iodine and a quarternary ammonium salt. An automated system is used to perform the diluting and the chemical reactions and feed the products to the atomic absorption spectrometer with an air-acetylene flame.
              2.2 The dilution of the gasoline with MIBK compensates for severe non-atomic absorption, scatter from unburned carbon containing species and matrix effects caused in part by the burning characteristics of gasoline.
              2.3 The in-situ reaction of alkyl lead in gasoline with iodine eliminates the problem of variations in response due to different alkyl types by leveling the response of all alkyl lead compounds.
              2.4 The addition of the quarternary ammonium salt improves response and increases the stability of the alkyl iodide complex.
              3. Sample handling and preservation.
              3.1 Samples should be collected and stored in containers which will protect them from changes in the lead content of the gasoline such as from loss of volatile fractions of the gasoline by evaporation or leaching of the lead into the container or cap.
              3.2 If samples have been refrigerated they should be brought to room temperature prior to analysis.

              8.1.1 Assure that instrumental conditions have been optimized and aligned according to Section 7 and the instrument has had substantial time for warm-up.
              8.2 Auto Analyzer start-up [see figure 1].

              8.2.1 Check all pump tubing and replace as necessary. Iodine tubing should be changed daily. All pump tubing should be replaced after one week of use. Place the platen on the pump.
              8.2.2 Withdraw any water from the sample wash cup and fill with certified unleaded gasoline (reagent 5.6).
              8.2.3 Fill the 2-liter MIBK dilution displacement Erlenmeyer flask (reagent 5.5) and the 0.5 liter Aliquat 336/MIBK 1% v/v (reagent 5.2) displacement flask and place the rubber stopper glass tubing assemblies in their respective flasks.
              8.2.4 Fill a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask with distilled water. The water will be used to displace the solvents. Therefore, place the appropriate lines in this flask. This procedure is not relevant if syringe pumps are used.
              8.2.5 Fill the final debubbler reverse displacement 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask with distilled water and place the rubber stopper glass tubing assembly in the flask.
              8.2.6 Place the appropriate lines for the iodine reagent (reagent 5.4) and the wash solution (reagent 5.6) in their respective bottles.
              8.2.7 Start the pump and connect the aspiration line from the manifold to the AAS.
              8.2.8 Some initial checks to assure that the reagents are being added are:
              a. A good uniform bubble pattern.
              b. Yellow color evident due to iodine in the system.
              c. No surging in any tubing.
              8.3 Calibration.
              8.3.1 Turn the chart drive on and obtain a steady baseline.
              8.3.2 Load standards and samples into sample tray.
              8.3.3 Start the sampler and run the standards (Note: first check the sample probe positioning with an empty test tube).
              8.3.4 Check the linearity of calibration standards response and slope by running a least squares fit. Check these results against previously obtained results. They should agree within 10%.
              8.3.5 If the above is in control then start the sample analysis.
              8.4 Sample Analysis.
              8.4.1 To minimize gasoline vapor in the laboratory, load the sample tray about 5-10 test tubes ahead of the sampler.
              8.4.2 Record the sample number on the strip chart corresponding to the appropriate peak.
              8.4.3 Every ten samples run the high calibration standard and a previously analyzed sample (duplicate). Also let the sampler skip to check the baseline.
              8.4.4 After an acceptable peak (within the calibration range) is obtained, pour the excess sample from the test tube into the waste gasoline can.
              8.4.5 Any sample resulting in a peak greater than 0.05 g Pb/gal will be run in duplicate. Samples registering greater than 0.10 g Pb/gal should be diluted with iso-octane or unleaded fuel to fall within the calibration range or a higher level calibration standard curve must be prepared. The higher level curve must be shown to be linear and measurement of lead at these levels must be shown to be accurate by the analysis of control samples at a higher level of alkyl lead content.
              8.5 Shut Down.
              8.5.1 Replace the solvent displacement flask with flasks filled with distilled water. Also place all other lines in a beaker of distilled water. Rinse the system with distilled water for 15 minutes.
              8.5.2 Withdraw the gasoline from the wash cup and fill with water.
              8.5.3 Dispose of all solvent waste in waste glass bottles.
              8.5.4 Turn the AAS off after extinguishing the flame. Also turn the recorder and pump off. Remove the platen and release the pump tubing.
              8.5.5 Shut the acetylene off at the tank and bleed the line.

              10.1 Precision.
              10.1.1 Duplicate analysis for 156 samples in a single laboratory has resulted in an average difference of 0.00011 g Pb/gal with a standard deviation of 0.0023.
              10.1.2 Replicate analysis in a single laboratory (greater than 5 determinations) of samples at concentrations of 0.010, 0.048, and 0.085 g Pb/gal resulted in relative standard deviations of 4.2%, 3.5%, and 3.3% respectively.
              10.2 Accuracy.
              10.2.1 The analysis of National Bureau of Standards (NBS) lead in reference fuel of known concentrations in a single laboratory has resulted in found values deviating from the true value for 11 determinations of 0.0322 g Pb/gal by an average of 0.56% with a standard deviation of 6.8%, for 15 determinations of 0.0519 g Pb/gal by an average of −1.1% with a standard deviation of 5.8%, and for 7 determinations of 0.0725 g Pb/gal by an average of 3.5% with a standard deviation of 4.8%.

              10.2.2 Twenty-three analyses of blind reference samples in a single laboratory (U.S. EPA, RTP, N.C.) have resulted in found values differing from the true value by an average of −0.0009 g Pb/gal with a standard deviation of 0.004.
              10.2.3 In a single laboratory, the average percent recovery of 108 spikes made to samples was 101% with a standard deviation of 5.6%.

              Method 3—Test for Lead in Gasoline by X-Ray Spectrometry
              1. Scope and application.
              1.1 This method covers the determination of the total lead content of gasoline. The procedure's calibration range is 0.010 to 5.0 grams of lead/U.S. gallon. Samples above this level should be diluted to fall within the range of 0.05 to 5.0 grams of lead/U.S. gallon. The method compensates for variations in gasoline composition and is independent of lead alkyl type.
              1.2 This method may be used as an alternative to Method 1—Standard Method Test for Lead in Gasoline by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, or to Method 2—Automated Method Test for Lead in Gasoline by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.
              1.3 Where trade names or specific products are noted in the method, equivalent apparatus and chemical reagents may be used. Mention of trade names or specific products is for the assistance of the user and does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
              2. Summary of method.
              2.1 A portion of the gasoline sample is placed in an appropriate holder and loaded into an X-ray spectrometer. The ratio of the net X-ray intensity of the lead L alpha radiation to the net intensity of the incoherently scattered tungsten L alpha radiation is measured. The lead content is determined by reference to a linear calibration equation which relates the lead content to the measured ratio.
              2.2 The incoherently scattered tungsten radiation is used to compensate for variations in gasoline samples.
              3. Sample handling and preservation.
              3.1 Samples should be collected and stored in containers which will protect them from changes in the lead content of the gasoline, such as loss of volatile fractions of the gasoline by evaporation or leaching of the lead into the container or cap.
              3.2 If samples have been refrigerated they should be brought to room temperature prior to analysis.
              3.3 Gasoline is extremely flammable and should be handled cautiously and with adequate ventilation. The vapors are harmful if inhaled and prolonged breathing of vapors should be avoided. Skin contact should be minimized. See precautionary statements in Annex Al.3.
              4. Apparatus.
              4.1 X-ray Spectrometer, capable of exciting and measuring the fluorescence lines mentioned in 2.1 and of being operated under the following instrumental conditions or others giving equivalent results: a tungsten target tube operated at 50 kV, a lithium fluoride analyzing crystal, an air or helium optical path and a proportional or scintillation detector.
              4.2 Some manufacturers of X-ray Spectrometer units no longer allow use of air as the beam path medium because the X-ray beam produces ozone, which may degrade seals and electronics. In addition, use of the equipment with liquid gasoline in close proximity to the hot X-ray tube could pose flammability problems with any machine in case of a rupture of the sample container. Therefore, use of the helium alternative is recommended.
              5. Reagents.
              5.1 Isooctane. Isooctane is flammable and the vapors may be harmful. See precautions in Annex Al.1.
              5.2 Lead standard solution, in isooctane, toluene or a mixture of these two solvents, containing approximately 5 gm Pb/U.S. gallon may be prepared from a lead-in-oil concentrate such as those prepared by Conostan (Conoco, Inc., Ponca City, Oklahoma). Isooctane and toluene are flammable and the vapors may be harmful. See precautionary statements in Annex Al.1 and Al.2.
              6. Calibration.
              6.1 Make exact dilutions with isooctane of the lead standard solution to give solutions with concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50, 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 g Pb/U.S. gallon. If a more limited range is desired as required for linearity, such range shall be covered by at least five standard solutions approximately equally spaced and this range shall not be exceeded by any of the samples. Place each of the standard solutions in a sample cell using techniques consistent with good operating practice for the spectrometer employed. Insert the sample in the spectrometer and allow the spectrometer atmosphere to reach equilibrium (if appropriate). Measure the intensity of the lead L alpha peak at 1.175 angstroms, the Compton scatter peak of the tungsten L alpha line at 1.500 angstroms and the background at 1.211 angstroms. Each measured intensity should exceed 200,000 counts or the time of measurement should be at least 30 seconds. The relative standard deviation of each measurement, based on counting statistics, should be one percent or less. The Compton scatter peak given above is for 90° instrument geometry and should be changed for other geometries. The Compton scatter peak (in angstroms) is found at the wavelength of the tungsten L alpha line plus 0.024 (1-cos phi), where phi is the angle between the incident radiation and the take-off collimator.

              6.2 For Each of the standards, as well as for an isooctane blank, determine the net lead intensity by subtracting the corrected background from the gross intensity. Determine the corrected background by multiplying the intensity of the background at 1.211 angstroms by the following ratio obtained on an isooctane blank:
              
                EC10NO91.007
              
              6.3 Determine the corrected lead intensity ratio, which is the net lead intensity corrected for matrix effects by division by the net incoherently scattered tungsten radiation. The net scattered intensity is calculated by subtracting the background intensity at 1.211 angstroms from the gross intensity of the incoherently scattered tungsten L alpha peak. The equation for the corrected lead intensity ratio follows:
              
                EC10NO91.008
              
              6.4 Obtain a linear calibration curve by performing a least squares fit of the corrected lead intensity ratios to the standard concentrations.
              7. Procedure.
              7.1 Prepare a calibration curve as described in 6. Since the scattered tungsten radiation serves as an internal standard, the calibration curve should serve for at least several days. Each day the suitability of the calibration curve should be checked by analyzing several National Bureau of Standards (NBS) lead-in-reference-fuel standards or other suitable standards.
              7.2 Determine the corrected lead intensity ratio for a sample in the same manner as was done for the standards. The samples should be brought to room temperature before analysis.
              7.3 Determine the lead concentration of the sample from the calibration curve. If the sample concentration is greater than 5.0 g Pb/U.S. gallon or the range calibrated for in 6.1, the sample should be diluted so that the result is within the calibration span of the instrument.
              7.4 Quality control standards, such as NBS standard reference materials, should be analyzed at least once every testing session.
              7.5 For each group of ten samples, a spiked sample should be prepared by adding a known amount of lead to a sample. This known addition should be at least 0.05 g Pb/U.S. gallon, at least 50% of the measured lead content of the unspiked sample, and not more than 200% of the measured lead content of the unspiked sample (unless the minimum addition of 0.05 g Pb/U.S. gallon exceeds 200%). Both the spiked and unspiked samples should be analyzed.
              8. Quality control.
              8.1 The difference between duplicates should not exceed 0.005 g Pb/U.S. gallon or a relative difference of 6%.
              8.2 All quality control standard check samples should agree within 10% of the nominal value of the standard.

              8.3 All spiked samples should have a percent recovery of 100% ±10%. The percent recovery, P, is calculated as follows:
              
              P = 100 × (A − B) / K
              
              where
              A = the analytical result from the spiked sample, B = the analytical result from the unspiked sample, and K = the known addition.
              

              8.4 The difference between independent analyses of the same sample in different laboratories should not exceed 0.01 g Pb/U.S. gallon or a relative difference of 12%.
              
              9. Past quality control data.
              
              
              9.1 Duplicate analysis for 26 samples in the range of 0.01 to 0.10 g Pb/U.S. gallon resulted in an average relative difference of 5.2% with a standard deviation of 5.4%. Duplicate analysis of 14 samples in the range 0.1 to 0.5 g Pb/U.S. gallon resulted in an average relative difference of 2.3% with a standard deviation of 2.0. Duplicate analysis of 47 samples in the range of 0.5 to 5 g Pb/U.S. gallon resulted in an average relative difference of 2.1% with a standard deviation of 1.8%.
              9.2 The average percent recovery for 23 spikes made to samples in the 0.0 to 0.1 g Pb/U.S. gallon range was 103% with a standard deviation of 3.2%. For 42 spikes made to samples in the 0.1 to 5.0 g Pb/U.S. gallon range, the average percent recovery was 102% with a standard deviation of 4.2%.

              9.3 The analysis of National Bureau of Standards lead-in-reference-fuel standards of known concentrations in a single laboratory has resulted in found values deviating from the true value for 14 determinations of 0.0490 g Pb/U.S. gallon by an average of 2.8% with a standard deviation of 6.4%, for 11 determinations of 0.065 g Pb/U.S. gallon by an average of 4.4% with a standard deviation of 2.9%, and for 15 determinations of 1.994 g Pb/U.S. gallon by an average of 0.3% with a standard deviation of 1.3%.
              9.4 Eighteen analyses of reference samples (U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC) have resulted in found values differing from the true value by an average of 0.0004 g Pb/U.S. gallon with a standard deviation of 0.004 g Pb/U.S. gallon.
