      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) The regulations of this subpart apply to hazardous waste burned or processed in a boiler or industrial furnace (as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter) irrespective of the purpose of burning or processing, except as provided by paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (g), and (h) of this section. In this subpart, the term “burn” means burning for energy recovery or destruction, or processing for materials recovery or as an ingredient. The emissions standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107 apply to facilities operating under interim status or under a RCRA permit as specified in §§ 266.102 and 266.103.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Integration of the MACT standards.</E> (1) Except as provided by paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, the standards of this part do not apply to a new hazardous waste boiler or industrial furnace unit that becomes subject to RCRA permit requirements after October 12, 2005; or no longer apply when an owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste boiler or industrial furnace unit demonstrates compliance with the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting to the Administrator a Notification of Compliance under §§ 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d) of this chapter documenting compliance with the requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter. Nevertheless, even after this demonstration of compliance with the MACT standards, RCRA permit conditions that were based on the standards of this part will continue to be in effect until they are removed from the permit or the permit is terminated or revoked, unless the permit expressly provides otherwise.</P>
              <P>(2) The following standards continue to apply:</P>
              <P>(i) If you elect to comply with § 270.235(a)(1)(i) of this chapter to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, § 266.102(e)(1) requiring operations in accordance with the operating requirements specified in the permit at all times that hazardous waste is in the unit, and § 266.102(e)(2)(iii) requiring compliance with the emission standards and operating requirements during startup and shutdown if hazardous waste is in the combustion chamber, except for particular hazardous wastes. These provisions apply only during startup, shutdown, and malfunction events;</P>
              <P>(ii) The closure requirements of §§ 266.102(e)(11) and 266.103(l);</P>
              <P>(iii) The standards for direct transfer of § 266.111;</P>
              <P>(iv) The standards for regulation of residues of § 266.112; and</P>
              <P>(v) The applicable requirements of subparts A through H, BB and CC of parts 264 and 265 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(3) If you own or operate a boiler or hydrochloric acid production furnace that is an area source under § 63.2 of this chapter and you elect not to comply with the emission standards under §§ 63.1216, 63.1217, and 63.1218 of this chapter for particulate matter, <PRTPAGE P="11"/>semivolatile and low volatile metals, and total chlorine, you also remain subject to:</P>
              <P>(i) Section 266.105—Standards to control particulate matter;</P>
              <P>(ii) Section 266.106—Standards to control metals emissions, except for mercury; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Section 266.107—Standards to control hydrogen chloride and chlorine gas.</P>
              <P>(4) The particulate matter standard of § 266.105 remains in effect for boilers that elect to comply with the alternative to the particulate matter standard under §§ 63.1216(e) and 63.1217(e) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) The following hazardous wastes and facilities are not subject to regulation under this subpart:</P>
              <P>(1) Used oil burned for energy recovery that is also a hazardous waste solely because it exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter. Such used oil is subject to regulation under part 279 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(2) Gas recovered from hazardous or solid waste landfills when such gas is burned for energy recovery;</P>
              <P>(3) Hazardous wastes that are exempt from regulation under §§ 261.4 and 261.6(a)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this chapter, and hazardous wastes that are subject to the special requirements for conditionally exempt small quantity generators under § 261.5 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(4) Coke ovens, if the only hazardous waste burned is EPA Hazardous Waste No. K087, decanter tank tar sludge from coking operations.</P>
              <P>(d) Owners and operators of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces (including pyrometallurgical devices such as cupolas, sintering machines, roasters, and foundry furnaces, but not including cement kilns, aggregate kilns, or halogen acid furnaces burning hazardous waste) that process hazardous waste solely for metal recovery are conditionally exempt from regulation under this subpart, except for §§ 266.101 and 266.112.</P>
              <P>(1) To be exempt from §§ 266.102 through 266.111, an owner or operator of a metal recovery furnace or mercury recovery furnace must comply with the following requirements, except that an owner or operator of a lead or a nickel-chromium recovery furnace, or a metal recovery furnace that burns baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing, must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces that are subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP must comply with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Provide a one-time written notice to the Director indicating the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The owner or operator claims exemption under this paragraph;</P>
              <P>(B) The hazardous waste is burned solely for metal recovery consistent with the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section;</P>
              <P>(C) The hazardous waste contains recoverable levels of metals; and</P>
              <P>(D) The owner or operator will comply with the sampling and analysis and recordkeeping requirements of this paragraph;</P>
              <P>(ii) Sample and analyze the hazardous waste and other feedstocks as necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph by using appropriate methods; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Maintain at the facility for at least three years records to document compliance with the provisions of this paragraph including limits on levels of toxic organic constituents and Btu value of the waste, and levels of recoverable metals in the hazardous waste compared to normal nonhazardous waste feedstocks.</P>
              <P>(2) A hazardous waste meeting either of the following criteria is not processed solely for metal recovery:</P>

              <P>(i) The hazardous waste has a total concentration of organic compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter exceeding 500 ppm by weight, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned for destruction. The concentration of organic compounds in a waste as-generated may be reduced to the 500 ppm limit by <E T="03">bona fide</E> treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 500 ppm limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the records required by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section; or<PRTPAGE P="12"/>
              </P>

              <P>(ii) The hazardous waste has a heating value of 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by <E T="03">bona fide</E> treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the records required by paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) To be exempt from §§ 266.102 through 266.111, an owner or operator of a lead or nickel-chromium or mercury recovery furnace (except for owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP) or a metal recovery furnace that burns baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing, must provide a one-time written notice to the Director identifying each hazardous waste burned and specifying whether the owner or operator claims an exemption for each waste under this paragraph or paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The owners or operator must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section for those wastes claimed to be exempt under that paragraph and must comply with the requirements below for those wastes claimed to be exempt under this paragraph (d)(3).</P>
              <P>(i) The hazardous wastes listed in appendices XI, XII, and XIII, part 266, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(A) A waste listed in appendix XI of this part must contain recoverable levels of lead, a waste listed in appendix XII of this part must contain recoverable levels of nickel or chromium, a waste listed in appendix XIII of this part must contain recoverable levels of mercury and contain less than 500 ppm of 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII organic constituents, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing must contain recoverable levels of metal; and</P>
              <P>(B) The waste does not exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic of § 261.24 of this chapter for an organic constituent; and</P>
              <P>(C) The waste is not a hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter because it is listed for an organic constituent as identified in appendix VII of part 261 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(D) The owner or operator certifies in the one-time notice that hazardous waste is burned under the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and that sampling and analysis will be conducted or other information will be obtained as necessary to ensure continued compliance with these requirements. Sampling and analysis shall be conducted according to paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and records to document compliance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall be kept for at least three years.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Director may decide on a case-by-case basis that the toxic organic constituents in a material listed in appendix XI, XII, or XIII of this part that contains a total concentration of more than 500 ppm toxic organic compounds listed in appendix VIII, part 261 of this chapter, may pose a hazard to human health and the environment when burned in a metal recovery furnace exempt from the requirements of this subpart. In that situation, after adequate notice and opportunity for comment, the metal recovery furnace will become subject to the requirements of this subpart when burning that material. In making the hazard determination, the Director will consider the following factors:</P>
              <P>(A) The concentration and toxicity of organic constituents in the material; and</P>

Such constituents must be identified and quantified if present, at levels detectable by using appropriate analytical procedures. The appendix VIII, part 261 constituents excluded from this analysis must be identified and the basis for their exclusion explained. This analysis will be used to provide all information required by this subpart and §§ 270.22 and 270.66 of this chapter and to enable the permit writer to prescribe such permit conditions as necessary to protect human health and the environment. Such analysis must be included as a portion of the part B permit application, or, for facilities operating under the interim status standards of this subpart, as a portion of the trial burn plan that may be submitted before the part B application under provisions of § 270.66(g) of this chapter as well as any other analysis required by the permit authority in preparing the permit. Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces not operating under the interim status standards must provide the information required by §§ 270.22 or 270.66(c) of this chapter in the part B application to the greatest extent possible.</P>
              <P>(2) Throughout normal operation, the owner or operator must conduct sampling and analysis as necessary to ensure that the hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feedstocks fired into the boiler or industrial furnace are within the physical and chemical composition limits specified in the permit.</P>

              <P>(2) Hazardous wastes not specified in the permit may not be burned until operating conditions have been specified under a new permit or permit modification, as applicable. Operating requirements for new wastes may be based on either trial burn results or alternative data included with part B of a permit application under § 270.22 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(3) Boilers and industrial furnaces operating under the interim status standards of § 266.103 are permitted under procedures provided by § 270.66(g) of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="15"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) A permit for a new boiler or industrial furnace (those boilers and industrial furnaces not operating under the interim status standards) must establish appropriate conditions for each of the applicable requirements of this section, including but not limited to allowable hazardous waste firing rates and operating conditions necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section, in order to comply with the following standards:</P>
              <P>(i) For the period beginning with initial introduction of hazardous waste and ending with initiation of the trial burn, and only for the minimum time required to bring the device to a point of operational readiness to conduct a trial burn, not to exceed a duration of 720 hours operating time when burning hazardous waste, the operating requirements must be those most likely to ensure compliance with the emission standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107, based on the Director's engineering judgment. If the applicant is seeking a waiver from a trial burn to demonstrate conformance with a particular emission standard, the operating requirements during this initial period of operation shall include those specified by the applicable provisions of § 266.104, § 266.105, § 266.106, or § 266.107. The Director may extend the duration of this period for up to 720 additional hours when good cause for the extension is demonstrated by the applicant.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the duration of the trial burn, the operating requirements must be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 and must be in accordance with the approved trial burn plan;</P>
              <P>(iii) For the period immediately following completion of the trial burn, and only for the minimum period sufficient to allow sample analysis, data computation, submission of the trial burn results by the applicant, review of the trial burn results and modification of the facility permit by the Director to reflect the trial burn results, the operating requirements must be those most likely to ensure compliance with the emission standards §§ 266.104 through 266.107 based on the Director's engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(iv) For the remaining duration of the permit, the operating requirements must be those demonstrated in a trial burn or by alternative data specified in § 270.22 of this chapter, as sufficient to ensure compliance with the emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Operating requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste must be operated in accordance with the operating requirements specified in the permit at all times where there is hazardous waste in the unit.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Requirements to ensure compliance with the organic emissions standards</E>—(i) <E T="03">DRE standard.</E> Operating conditions will be specified either on a case-by-case basis for each hazardous waste burned as those demonstrated (in a trial burn or by alternative data as specified in § 270.22) to be sufficient to comply with the destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) performance standard of § 266.104(a) or as those special operating requirements provided by § 266.104(a)(4) for the waiver of the DRE trial burn. When the DRE trial burn is not waived under § 266.104(a)(4), each set of operating requirements will specify the composition of the hazardous waste (including acceptable variations in the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous waste which will not affect compliance with the DRE performance standard) to which the operating requirements apply. For each such hazardous waste, the permit will specify acceptable operating limits including, but not limited to, the following conditions as appropriate:</P>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Rolling average limits for carcinogenic metals and lead.</E> Feed rate limits for the carcinogenic metals (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium and chromium) and lead may be established either on an hourly rolling average basis as prescribed by paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section or on (up to) a 24 hour rolling average basis. If the owner or operator elects to use an average period from 2 to 24 hours:</P>
              <P>(A) The feed rate of each metal shall be limited at any time to ten times the feed rate that would be allowed on an hourly rolling average basis;</P>
              <P>(B) The continuous monitor shall meet the following specifications:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A continuous monitor is one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60 seconds.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The rolling average for the selected averaging period is defined as the arithmetic mean of one hour block averages for the averaging period. A one hour block average is the arithmetic mean of the one minute averages recorded during the 60-minute period beginning at one minute after the beginning of the preceding clock hour; and</P>

              <P>(C) The permit limit for the feed rate of each metal shall be established based on trial burn data as the average over all valid test runs of the highest <PRTPAGE P="19"/>hourly rolling average feed rate for each run.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Feed rate limits for metals, total chloride and chlorine, and ash.</E> Feed rate limits for metals, total chlorine and chloride, and ash are established and monitored by knowing the concentration of the substance (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, metals, chloride/chlorine, and ash) in each feedstream and the flow rate of the feedstream. To monitor the feed rate of these substances, the flow rate of each feedstream must be monitored under the continuous monitoring requirements of paragraphs (e)(6) (i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Conduct of trial burn testing.</E> (A) If compliance with all applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 is not demonstrated simultaneously during a set of test runs, the operating conditions of additional test runs required to demonstrate compliance with remaining emissions standards must be as close as possible to the original operating conditions.</P>
              <P>(B) Prior to obtaining test data for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 or establishing limits on operating parameters under this section, the facility must operate under trial burn conditions for a sufficient period to reach steady-state operations. The Director may determine, however, that industrial furnaces that recycle collected particulate matter back into the furnace and that comply with an alternative implementation approach for metals under § 266.106(f) need not reach steady state conditions with respect to the flow of metals in the system prior to beginning compliance testing for metals emissions.</P>

              <P>(C) Trial burn data on the level of an operating parameter for which a limit must be established in the permit must be obtained during emissions sampling for the pollutant(s) (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, metals, PM, HCl/Cl<E T="52">2</E>, organic compounds) for which the parameter must be established as specified by paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">General requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Fugitive emissions.</E> Fugitive emissions must be controlled by:</P>
              <P>(A) Keeping the combustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or</P>
              <P>(B) Maintaining the combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure; or</P>
              <P>(C) An alternate means of control demonstrated (with part B of the permit application) to provide fugitive emissions control equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric pressure.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Automatic waste feed cutoff.</E> A boiler or industrial furnace must be operated with a functioning system that automatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed when operating conditions deviate from those established under this section. The Director may limit the number of cutoffs per an operating period on a case-by-case basis. In ­addition:</P>
              <P>(A) The permit limit for (the indicator of) minimum combustion chamber temperature must be maintained while hazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber,</P>
              <P>(B) Exhaust gases must be ducted to the air pollution control system operated in accordance with the permit requirements while hazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion chamber; and</P>
              <P>(C) Operating parameters for which permit limits are established must continue to be monitored during the cutoff, and the hazardous waste feed shall not be restarted until the levels of those parameters comply with the permit limits. For parameters that may be monitored on an instantaneous basis, the Director will establish a minimum period of time after a waste feed cutoff during which the parameter must not exceed the permit limit before the hazardous waste feed may be restarted.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Changes.</E> A boiler or industrial furnace must cease burning hazardous waste when changes in combustion properties, or feed rates of the hazardous waste, other fuels, or industrial furnace feedstocks, or changes in the boiler or industrial furnace design or operating conditions deviate from the limits as specified in the permit.</P>

              <P>(B) If specified by the permit, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and oxygen on a continuous basis at a common point in the boiler or industrial furnace downstream of the combustion zone and prior to release of stack gases to the atmosphere in accordance with operating requirements specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. CO, HC, and oxygen monitors must be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with methods specified in appendix IX of this part.</P>
              <P>(C) Upon the request of the Director, sampling and analysis of the hazardous waste (and other fuels and industrial furnace feedstocks as appropriate), residues, and exhaust emissions must be conducted to verify that the operating requirements established in the permit achieve the applicable standards of §§ 266.104, 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107.</P>
              <P>(ii) All monitors shall record data in units corresponding to the permit limit unless otherwise specified in the ­permit.</P>
              <P>(iii) The boiler or industrial furnace and associated equipment (pumps, valves, pipes, fuel storage tanks, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual inspection when it contains hazardous waste, at least daily for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions, and signs of tampering.</P>
              <P>(iv) The automatic hazardous waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms must be tested at least once every 7 days when hazardous waste is burned to verify operability, unless the applicant demonstrates to the Director that weekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent inspections will be adequate. At a minimum, operational testing must be conducted at least once every 30 days.</P>
              <P>(v) These monitoring and inspection data must be recorded and the records must be placed in the operating record required by § 264.73 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Interim status standards for burners.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose, scope, applicability</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) The purpose of this section is to establish minimum national standards for owners and operators of “existing” boilers and industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste where such standards define the acceptable management of hazardous waste during the period of interim status. The standards of this section apply to owners and operators of existing facilities until either a permit is issued under § 266.102(d) or until closure responsibilities identified in this section are fulfilled.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Existing or in existence</E> means a boiler or industrial furnace that on or before August 21, 1991 is either in operation burning or processing hazardous waste or for which construction (including the ancillary facilities to burn or to process the hazardous waste) has commenced. A facility has commenced construction if the owner or operator has obtained the Federal, State, and local approvals or permits necessary to begin physical construction; and ­either:</P>
              <P>(A) A continuous on-site, physical construction program has begun; or</P>
              <P>(B) The owner or operator has entered into contractual obligations—which cannot be canceled or modified without substantial loss—for physical construction of the facility to be completed within a reasonable time.</P>

              <P>(iii) If a boiler or industrial furnace is located at a facility that already has <PRTPAGE P="21"/>a permit or interim status, then the facility must comply with the applicable regulations dealing with permit modifications in § 270.42 or changes in interim status in § 270.72 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> The requirements of this section do not apply to hazardous waste and facilities exempt under §§ 266.100(b), or 266.108.</P>

              <P>(A) The hazardous waste has a total concentration of nonmetal compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter exceeding 500 ppm by weight, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned for destruction. The concentration of nonmetal compounds in a waste as-generated may be reduced to the 500 ppm limit by <E T="03">bona fide</E> treatment that removes or destroys nonmetal constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 500 ppm limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted must be retained in the facility record; or</P>

              <P>(B) The hazardous waste has a heating value of 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by <E T="03">bona fide</E> treatment that removes or destroys organic constituents. Blending to augment the heating value to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly blended must be retained in the facility record.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Restrictions on burning hazardous waste that is not a fuel.</E> Prior to certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, owners and operators shall not feed hazardous waste <PRTPAGE P="22"/>that has a heating value less than 5,000 Btu/lb, as-generated, (except that the heating value of a waste as-generated may be increased to above the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by <E T="03">bona fide</E> treatment; however, blending to augment the heating value to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is prohibited and records must be kept to document that impermissible blending has not occurred) in a boiler or industrial furnace, except that:</P>

              <P>(iii) Such waste may be burned if the Director has documentation to show that, prior to August 21, 1991:</P>
              <P>(A) The boiler or industrial furnace is operating under the interim status standards for incinerators provided by subpart O of part 265 of this chapter, or the interim status standards for thermal treatment units provided by subpart P of part 265 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(B) The boiler or industrial furnace met the interim status eligibility requirements under § 270.70 of this chapter for subpart O or subpart P of part 265 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(C) Hazardous waste with a heating value less than 5,000 Btu/lb was burned prior to that date; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Such waste may be burned in a halogen acid furnace if the waste was burned as an excluded ingredient under § 261.2(e) of this chapter prior to February 21, 1991 and documentation is kept on file supporting this claim.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification of precompliance</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The owner or operator must provide complete and accurate information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to the Director on or before August 21, 1991, and must establish limits for the operating parameters specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Such information is termed a “certification of precompliance” and constitutes a certification that the owner or operator has determined that, when the facility is operated within the limits specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the owner or operator believes that, using best engineering judgment, emissions of particulate matter, metals, and HCl and Cl<E T="52">2</E> are not likely to exceed the limits provided by §§ 266.105, 266.106, and 266.107. The facility may burn hazardous waste only under the operating conditions that the owner or operator establishes under paragraph (b)(3) of this section until the owner or operator submits a revised certification of precompliance under paragraph (b)(8) of this section or a certification of compliance under paragraph (c) of this section, or until a permit is issued.</P>

The testing must be conducted when burning normal hazardous waste for that day at normal feed rates for that day and when the air pollution control system is operated under normal conditions. During interim status, hazardous waste analysis for metals content must be sufficient for the owner or operator to determine if changes in metals content may affect the ability of the facility to meet the metals emissions standards established under § 266.106(c) or (d). Under this option, operating limits (under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) must be established during compliance testing under paragraph (c)(3) of this section only on the following parameters;</P>

              <P>(B) Prior to obtaining test data for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the applicable emissions standards of §§ 266.104 through 266.107 or establishing limits on operating parameters under this section, the facility must operate under compliance test conditions for a sufficient period to reach steady-state operations. Industrial furnaces that recycle collected particulate matter back into the furnace and that comply with paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, however, need not reach steady state conditions with respect to the flow of metals in the system prior to beginning compliance testing for metals.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Designation of POHCs.</E> Principal organic hazardous constituents (POHCs) are those compounds for which compliance with the DRE requirements of this section shall be demonstrated in a trial burn in conformance with procedures prescribed in § 270.66 of this chapter. One or more POHCs shall be designated by the Director for each waste feed to be burned. POHCs shall be designated based on the degree of difficulty of destruction of the organic constituents in the waste and on their concentrations or mass in the waste feed considering the results of waste analyses submitted with part B of the permit application. POHCs are most likely to be selected from among those compounds listed in part 261, appendix VIII of this chapter that are also present in the normal waste feed. However, if the applicant demonstrates to the Regional Administrator's satisfaction that a compound not listed in appendix VIII or not present in the normal waste feed is a suitable indicator of compliance with the DRE requirements of this section, that compound may be designated as a POHC. Such POHCs need not be toxic or organic compounds.</P>

This performance must be demonstrated on POHCs that are more difficult to burn than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-<E T="03">p</E>-dioxins and dibenzofurans. DRE is determined for each POHC from the equation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In addition, the owner or operator of the boiler or industrial furnace must notify the Director of intent to burn EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Automatic waiver of DRE trial burn.</E> Owners and operators of boilers operated under the special operating requirements provided by § 266.110 are considered to be in compliance with the DRE standard of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and are exempt from the DRE trial burn.</P>

              <P>(2) CO and oxygen shall be continuously monitored in conformance with “Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoring of Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen for Incinerators, Boilers, and Industrial Furnaces Burning Hazardous Waste” in appendix IX of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Compliance with the 100 ppmv CO limit must be demonstrated during the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status facility applying for a permit) or the compliance test (for interim status facilities). To demonstrate compliance, the highest hourly rolling average CO level during any valid run of the trial burn or compliance test must not exceed 100 ppmv.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative carbon monoxide standard.</E> (1) The stack gas concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) from a boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste may exceed the 100 ppmv limit provided that stack gas concentrations of hydrocarbons (HC) do not exceed 20 ppmv, except as provided by paragraph (f) of this section for certain industrial furnaces.</P>

              <P>(2) HC limits must be established under this section on an hourly rolling average basis (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, over any 60 minute period), reported as propane, and continuously corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry gas basis.</P>

CO and oxygen shall be continuously monitored in conformance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The alternative CO standard is established based on CO data during the trial burn (for a new facility) and the compliance test (for an interim status facility). The alternative CO standard is the average over all valid runs of the highest hourly average CO level for each run.

Under Tier II and Tier III, the feed rate of total chloride and chlorine is limited to the feed rates during the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status facility applying for a permit) or the compliance test (for interim status facilities).

              <P>A residue derived from the burning or processing of hazardous waste in a boiler or industrial furnace is not excluded from the definition of a hazardous waste under § 261.4(b) (4), (7), or (8) unless the device and the owner or operator meet the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(a) The device meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Boilers.</E> Boilers must burn at least 50% coal on a total heat input or mass input basis, whichever results in the greater mass feed rate of coal;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Ore or mineral furnaces.</E> Industrial furnaces subject to § 261.4(b)(7) must process at least 50% by weight normal, nonhazardous raw materials;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Cement kilns.</E> Cement kilns must process at least 50% by weight normal cement-production raw materials;</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator demonstrates that the hazardous waste does not significantly affect the residue by demonstrating conformance with either of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Comparison of waste-derived residue with normal residue.</E> The waste-derived residue must not contain appendix VIII, part 261 constituents (toxic constituents) that could reasonably be attributable to the hazardous waste at concentrations significantly higher than in residue generated without burning or processing of hazardous waste, using the following procedure. <PRTPAGE P="48"/>Toxic compounds that could reasonably be attributable to burning or processing the hazardous waste (constituents of concern) include toxic constituents in the hazardous waste, and the organic compounds listed in appendix VIII of this part that may be generated as products of incomplete combustion. For polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzo-furans, analyses must be performed to determine specific congeners and homologues, and the results converted to 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent values using the procedure specified in section 4.0 of appendix IX of this part.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Normal residue.</E> Concentrations of toxic constituents of concern in normal residue shall be determined based on analyses of a minimum of 10 samples representing a minimum of 10 days of operation. Composite samples may be used to develop a sample for analysis provided that the compositing period does not exceed 24 hours. The upper tolerance limit (at 95% confidence with a 95% proportion of the sample distribution) of the concentration in the normal residue shall be considered the statistically-derived concentration in the normal residue. If changes in raw materials or fuels reduce the statistically-derived concentrations of the toxic constituents of concern in the normal residue, the statistically-derived concentrations must be revised or statistically-derived concentrations of toxic constituents in normal residue must be established for a new mode of operation with the new raw material or fuel. To determine the upper tolerance limit in the normal residue, the owner or operator shall use statistical procedures prescribed in “Statistical Methodology for Bevill Residue Determinations” in appendix IX of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Waste-derived residue.</E> Waste-derived residue shall be sampled and analyzed as often as necessary to determine whether the residue generated during each 24-hour period has concentrations of toxic constituents that are higher than the concentrations established for the normal residue under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. If so, hazardous waste burning has significantly affected the residue and the residue shall not be excluded from the definition of a hazardous waste. Concentrations of toxic constituents of concern in the waste-derived residue shall be determined based on analysis of one or more samples obtained over a 24-hour period. Multiple samples may be analyzed, and multiple samples may be taken to form a composite sample for analysis provided that the sampling period does not exceed 24 hours. If more than one sample is analyzed to characterize waste-derived residues generated over a 24-hour period, the concentration of each toxic constituent shall be the arithmetic mean of the concentrations in the samples. No results may be disregarded; or</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Comparison of waste-derived residue concentrations with health-based limits</E>—(i) <E T="03">Nonmetal constituents:</E> The concentration of each nonmetal toxic constituent of concern (specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) in the waste-derived residue must not exceed the health-based level specified in appendix VII of this part, or the level of detection, whichever is higher. If a health-based limit for a constituent of concern is not listed in appendix VII of this part, then a limit of 0.002 micrograms per kilogram or the level of detection (which must be determined by using appropriate analytical procedures), whichever is higher, must be used. The levels specified in appendix VII of this part (and the default level of 0.002 micrograms per kilogram or the level of detection for constituents as identified in Note 1 of appendix VII of this chapter) are administratively stayed under the condition, for those constituents specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the owner or operator complies with alternative levels defined as the land disposal restriction limits specified in § 268.43 of this chapter for F039 nonwastewaters. In complying with those alternative levels, if an owner or operator is unable to detect a constituent despite documenting use of best good-faith efforts as defined by applicable Agency guidance or standards, the owner or operator is deemed to be in compliance for that constituent. Until new guidance or standards are developed, the owner or operator may demonstrate such good-faith efforts by achieving a detection limit for the constituent that does not exceed an order <PRTPAGE P="49"/>of magnitude above the level provided by § 268.43 of this chapter for F039 nonwastewaters. In complying with the § 268.43 of this chapter F039 nonwastewater levels for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzo-furans, analyses must be performed for total hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, total hexachlorodibenzofurans, total pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, total pentachlorodibenzofurans, total tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, and total tetrachlorodibenzofurans.

              <P>(a) A military munition is not a solid waste when:</P>
              <P>(1) Used for its intended purpose, including:</P>
              <P>(i) Use in training military personnel or explosives and munitions emergency response specialists (including training in proper destruction of unused propellant or other munitions); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Use in research, development, testing, and evaluation of military munitions, weapons, or weapon systems; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Recovery, collection, and on-range destruction of unexploded ordnance and munitions fragments during range clearance activities at active or inactive ranges. However, “use for intended purpose” does not include the on-range disposal or burial of unexploded ordnance and contaminants when the burial is not a result of product use.</P>
              <P>(2) An unused munition, or component thereof, is being repaired, reused, recycled, reclaimed, disassembled, reconfigured, or otherwise subjected to materials recovery activities, unless such activities involve use constituting disposal as defined in 40 CFR 261.2(c)(1), or burning for energy recovery as defined in 40 CFR 261.2(c)(2).</P>
              <P>(b) An unused military munition is a solid waste when any of the following occurs:</P>
              <P>(1) The munition is abandoned by being disposed of, burned, detonated (except during intended use as specified in paragraph (a) of this section), incinerated, or treated prior to disposal; or</P>
              <P>(2) The munition is removed from storage in a military magazine or other storage area for the purpose of being disposed of, burned, or incinerated, or treated prior to disposal, or</P>
              <P>(3) The munition is deteriorated or damaged (e.g., the integrity of the munition is compromised by cracks, leaks, or other damage) to the point that it cannot be put into serviceable condition, and cannot reasonably be recycled or used for other purposes; or</P>
              <P>(4) The munition has been declared a solid waste by an authorized military official.</P>
              <P>(c) A used or fired military munition is a solid waste:</P>
              <P>(1) When transported off range or from the site of use, where the site of use is not a range, for the purposes of storage, reclamation, treatment, disposal, or treatment prior to disposal; or</P>
              <P>(2) If recovered, collected, and then disposed of by burial, or landfilling either on or off a range.</P>

              <P>(d) For purposes of RCRA section 1004(27), a used or fired military munition is a solid waste, and, therefore, is potentially subject to RCRA corrective action authorities under sections 3004(u) and (v), and 3008(h), or imminent and substantial endangerment authorities under section 7003, if the munition lands off-range and is not promptly rendered safe and/or retrieved. Any imminent and substantial threats associated with any remaining material must be addressed. If remedial action is infeasible, the operator of <PRTPAGE P="51"/>the range must maintain a record of the event for as long as any threat remains. The record must include the type of munition and its location (to the extent the location is known).</P>

                <P>(1) If you fail to meet any of the conditions specified in § 266.230 you must report to us and the NRC, or the oversight agency in the NRC Agreement State, in writing by certified delivery within 30 days of learning of the failure. Your report must be signed by your authorized representative certifying that the information provided is true, accurate, and complete. This report must include:</P>
                <P>(i) The specific condition(s) you failed to meet;</P>

                <P>(2) If the failure to meet any of the conditions may endanger human health or the environment, you must also immediately notify us orally within 24 hours and follow up with a written notification within five days. Failures that may endanger human health or the environment include, but are not limited to, discharge of a CERCLA reportable quantity or other leaking or exploding tanks or containers, or detection of radionuclides above background or hazardous constituents in the leachate collection system of a storage area. If the failure may endanger human health or the environment, you must follow the provisions of your emergency plan.<PRTPAGE P="56"/>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">2.1 Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoring of Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen for Incinerators, Boilers, and Industrial Furnaces Burning Hazardous Waste</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.1 Applicability and Principle</HD>

              <P>2.1.1.1 Applicability. These performance specifications apply to carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O<E T="52">2</E>) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMSs) installed on incinerators, boilers, and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste. The specifications include procedures which are intended to be used to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of its installation or whenever specified in regulations or permits. The procedures are not designed to evaluate CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible for the proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of the CEMS at all times.</P>
              <P>2.1.1.2 Principle. Installation and measurement location specifications, performance and equipment specifications, test and data reduction procedures, and brief quality assurance guidelines are included in the specifications. Calibration drift, relative accuracy, calibration error, and response time tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the specifications.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.2 Definitions</HD>
              <P>2.1.2.1 Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). A continuous monitor is one in which the sample to be analyzed passes the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption, and which evaluates the detector response to the sample at least once each 15 seconds and computes and records the results at least every 60 seconds. A CEMS consists of all the equipment used to acquire data and includes the sample extraction and transport hardware, the analyzer(s), and the data recording/processing hardware and software.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.2 Monitoring System Types. The specifications require CEMSs capable of accepting calibration gases. Alternative system designs may be used if approved by the Regional Administrator. There are two basic types of monitoring systems: extractive and in-situ.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.2.1 Extractive. Systems that use a pump or other mechanical, pneumatic, or hydraulic means to draw a sample of the stack or flue gas and convey it to a remotely located analyzer.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.2.2 In-situ. Systems that perform an analysis without removing a sample from the stack. Point in-situ analyzers place the sensing or detecting element directly in the flue gas stream. Cross-stack in-situ analyzers measure the parameter of interest by placing a source beam on one side of the stack and the detector (in single-pass instruments) or a retroreflector (in double-pass instruments) on the other side, and measuring the parameter of interest (e.g., CO) by the attenuation of the beam by the gas in its path.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.3 Instrument Measurement Range. The difference between the minimum and maximum concentration that can be measured by a specific instrument. The minimum is often stated or assumed to be zero and the range expressed only as the maximum.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.4 Span or Span Value. Full scale instrument measurement range.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.5 Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the CEMS output readings from the established reference value after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. A CD test is performed to demonstrate the stability of the CEMS calibration over time.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.6 Response Time. The time interval between the start of a step change in the system input (e.g., change of calibration gas) and the time when the data recorder displays 95 percent of the final value.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.7 Accuracy. A measure of agreement between a measured value and an accepted or true value, expressed as the percentage difference between the true and measured values relative to the true value. For these performance specifications, accuracy is checked by conducting a calibration error (CE) test and a relative accuracy (RA) test. Certain facilities, such as those using solid waste or batch-fed processes, may observe long periods of almost no CO emissions with brief, high-level CO emission spikes. These facilities, as well as facilities whose CO emissions never exceed 5-10 ppm, may need to be exempted from the RA requirement because the RA test procedure cannot ensure acquisition of meaningful test results under these conditions. An alternative procedure for accuracy determination is described in section 2.1.9.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.8 Calibration Error (CE). The difference between the concentration indicated by the CEMS and the known concentration of the cylinder gas. A CE test procedure is performed to document the accuracy and linearity of the monitoring equipment over the entire measurement range.</P>

              <P>2.1.2.9 Relative Accuracy (RA). A comparison of the CEMS response to a value measured by a performance test method <PRTPAGE P="86"/>(PTM). The RA test is used to validate the calibration technique and verify the ability of the CEMS to provide representative and accurate measurements.</P>

              <P>2.1.2.10 Performance Test Method (PTM). The sampling and analysis procedure used to obtain reference measurements for comparison to CEMS measurements. The applicable test methods are Method 10, 10A, or 10B (for the determination of CO) and Method 3 or 3A (for the determination of O<E T="52">2</E>). These methods are found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.11 Performance Specification Test (PST) Period. The period during which CD, CE, response time, and RA tests are conducted.</P>
              <P>2.1.2.12 Centroidal Area. A concentric area that is geometrically similar to the stack or duct cross section and is no greater than 1 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.3 Installation and Measurement Location Specifications</HD>
              <P>2.1.3.1 CEMS Installation and Measurement Locations. The CEMS shall be installed in a location in which measurements representative of the source's emissions can be obtained. The optimum location of the sample interface for the CEMS is determined by a number of factors, including ease of access for calibration and maintenance, the degree to which sample conditioning will be required, the degree to which it represents total emissions, and the degree to which it represents the combustion situation in the firebox. The location should be as free from in-leakage influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flow disturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent duct diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameter upstream from the exhaust or control device. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated as per 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1. If these criteria are not achievable or if the location is otherwise less than optimum, the possibility of stratification should be checked as described in Section 2.1.3.3 to determine whether the location would cause failure of the relative accuracy test.</P>
              <P>2.1.3.1.1 For extractive or point in-situ CEMSs, the measurement point should be within or centrally located over the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.</P>
              <P>2.1.3.1.2 For cross-stack CEMSs, the effective measurement path should (1) have at least 70 percent of the path within the inner 50 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area or (2) be centrally located over any part of the centroidal area.</P>
              <P>2.1.3.1.3 Both the CO and O<E T="52">2</E> monitors should be installed at the same general location. If this is not possible, they may be installed at different locations if the effluent gases at both sample locations are not stratified and there is no in-leakage of air between sampling locations.</P>
              <P>2.1.3.2 Performance Test Method (PTM) Measurement Location and Traverse Points.</P>

              <P>2.1.3.2.1 Select an accessible PTM measurement point at least two equivalent diameters downstream from the nearest control device, the point of CO generation, or other point at which a change in the CO concentration may occur, and at least a half equivalent diameter upstream from the effluent exhaust or control device. When pollutant concentration changes are due solely to diluent leakage (e.g., air heater leakages) and CO and O<E T="52">2</E> are simultaneously measured at the same location, one half diameter may be used in place of two equivalent diameters. The CEMS and PTM locations need not be the same.</P>
              <P>2.1.3.2.2 Select traverse points that ensure acquisition of representative samples over the stack or duct cross section. At a minimum, establish a measurement line that passes through the centroidal area in the direction of any expected stratification. If this line interferes with the CEMS measurements, displace the line up to 30 cm (or 5 percent of the equivalent diameter of the cross section, whichever is less) from the centroidal area. Locate three traverse points at 17, 50, and 83 percent of the measurement line. If the measurement line is no longer than 2.4 meters and pollutant stratification is not expected, the tester may choose to locate the three traverse points on the line at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the stack or duct wall. This option must not be used at a site located within eight equivalent diameters downstream of a flow disturbance. The tester may select other traverse points, provided that they can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administrator to provide a representative sample over the stack or duct cross-section. Conduct all necessary PTM tests within 3 cm of the selected traverse points. Sampling must not be performed within 3 cm of the duct or stack inner wall.</P>

              <P>2.1.3.3 Stratification Test Procedure. Stratification is defined as a difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0 meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid, is used as a stationary reference point to indicate the change in effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling at the traverse <PRTPAGE P="87"/>points specified in method 1, appendix A, 40 CFR part 60. The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.4 CEMS Performance and Equipment Specifications</HD>
              <P>Table 2.1-1 summarizes the performance specifications for the CEMSs. Two sets of standards for CO are given; one for low-range and another for high-range measurements. The high-range specifications relate to measurement and quantification of short duration high concentration peaks, while the low-range specifications relate to the overall average operating condition of the burning device. The dual-range specifications can be met by using (1) one analyzer for each range, (2) a dual range unit, or (3) a single measurement range instrument capable of meeting both specifications with a single unit. Adjustments cannot be made to the analyzer between determinations of low- and high-level accuracy within the single measurement range. In the second case, when the concentration exceeds the span of the lower range, the data acquisition system recorder shall switch to the high range automatically.</P>
              <P>2.1.4.1 CEMS Span Value. In order to measure high and low concentrations with the same or similar degree of accuracy, the maximum ranges (span values) are specified for low and high range analyzers. The span values are listed in Table 2.1-2. Tier I and Tier II format definitions are established in 40 CFR part 266, subpart H.</P>

              <P>2.1.4.2 Daily Calibration Gas Values. The owner or operator must choose calibration gas concentrations (or calibration filters for in-situ systems) that include zero and high-level calibration values for the daily calibration checks. For a single measurement range monitor, three CO calibration gas concentrations (or calibration filters for in-situ systems) shall be used, i.e., the zero and high-level concentrations of the low-range CO analyzer and the high-level concentration of the high-range CO analyzer.</P>
              <P>2.1.4.2.1 The zero level for the CO or O<E T="52">2</E> analyzer may be between zero and 20 percent of the span value, e.g., 0-40 ppm for low-range CO analyzer, 0-600 ppm for the high-range CO analyzer, and 0-5 percent for the O<E T="52">2</E> analyzer (for Tier I).</P>

              <P>2.1.4.2.2 The high-level concentration for the CO or O<E T="52">2</E> analyzer shall be between 50 and 90 percent of the span value, i.e., 100-180 ppm for the low-range CO analyzer, 1500-2700 ppm for the high-range CO analyzer, and 12.5-22.5 percent O<E T="52">2</E> for the O<E T="52">2</E> analyzer.</P>

              <P>2.1.4.3 Data Recorder Scale. The strip chart recorder, computer, or digital recorder must be capable of recording all readings within the CEMS's measurement range and shall have a resolution of 0.5 percent of span value, i.e., 1 ppm CO for low-range CO analyzer, 15 ppm CO for high-range CO analyzer, and 0.1 percent O<E T="52">2</E> for the O<E T="52">2</E> analyzer.</P>

              <P>2.1.4.4 Response Time. The response time for the CO or O<E T="52">2</E> monitor shall not exceed 2 minutes to achieve 95 percent of the final stable value.</P>

              <P>2.1.4.5 Calibration Drift. The CEMS must allow the determination of CD at the zero and high-level values. The CD must be determined separately for CO and O<E T="52">2</E> monitors in terms of concentration. The CO CEMS calibration response must not drift or deviate from the reference value of the calibration gas (or calibration filters for in-situ systems) by more than 3 percent of the span value after each 24-hour period of the 7-day test, i.e., 6 ppm CO for the low-range analyzer (Tier I) and 90 ppm for the high-range analyzer, at both zero and high levels. The O<E T="52">2</E> monitor calibration response must not drift or deviate from the reference value by more than 0.5 percent O<E T="52">2</E> at both zero and high ­levels.<PRTPAGE P="88"/>
              </P>

              <P>2.1.4.6 Relative Accuracy. The result of the RA test of the CO CEMS (which incorporates the O<E T="52">2</E> monitor) must be no greater than 10 percent of the mean value of the PTM results or must be within 10 ppm CO of the PTM results, whichever is less restrictive. The ppm CO concentration shall be corrected to 7 percent O<E T="52">2</E> before calculating the RA.</P>

              <P>2.1.4.7 Calibration Error. The mean difference between the CEMS and reference values at all three test points (see Table 2.1-3) must be no greater than 5 percent of span value for CO monitors (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, 10 ppm CO for low range Tier I CO analyzers and 150 ppm CO for high range CO analyzers) and 0.5 percent for O<E T="52">2</E> analyzers.</P>
              <P>2.1.4.8 Measurement and Recording Frequency. The sample to be analyzed shall pass through the measurement section of the analyzer without interruption. The detector shall measure the sample concentration at least once every 15 seconds. An average emission rate shall be computed and recorded at least once every 60 seconds.</P>
              <P>2.1.4.9 Hourly Rolling Average Calculation. The CEMS shall calculate every minute an hourly rolling average, which is the arithmetic mean of the 60 most recent 1-minute average values.</P>
              <P>2.1.4.10 Retest. If the CEMS produces results within the specified criteria, the test is successful. If the CEMS does not meet one or more of the criteria, the necessary corrections must be made and the performance tests repeated.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2.1.5 Test Periods</HD>
              <P>2.1.5.1 Pretest Preparation Period. Install the CEMS, prepare the PTM test site according to the specifications in section 2.1.3, and prepare the CEMS for operation and calibration according to the manufacturer's written instructions. A pretest conditioning period similar to that of the 7-day CD test is recommended to verify the operational status of the CEMS.</P>
              <P>2.1.5.2 Calibration Drift Test Period. While the facility is operating under normal conditions, determine the CD at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days according to the procedure given in section 2.1.6.1. All CD determinations must be made following a 24-hour period during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment takes place. If the combustion unit is taken out of service during the test period, record the onset and duration of the downtime and continue the calibration drift test when the unit resumes operation.</P>

              <P>2.1.5.3 Relative Accuracy Test Period. Conduct the RA test according to the procedure in section 2.1.6.4 while the facility is operating under normal conditions. RA testing for CO and O<E T="52">2</E> shall be conducted simultaneously so that the results can be calculated for CO corrected to 7 percent O<E T="52">2</E>. The RA test shall be conducted during the CD test period. It is emphasized that during the CD test period, no adjustments or repairs may be made to the CEMS other than routine calibration adjustments performed immediately following the daily CD determination.</P>
              <P>2.1.5.4 Calibration Error Test and Response Time Test Periods. Conduct the CE and response time tests during the CD test period.</P>

              <P>2.1.6.1.1 Sampling Strategy. Conduct the CD test for all monitors at 24-hour intervals for seven consecutive days using calibration gases at the two (or three, if applicable) concentration levels specified in section 2.1.4.2. Introduce the calibration gases into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical. The gas shall pass through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other CEMS components used during normal sampling. If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined. Record the CEMS response and subtract this value from the reference (calibration gas) value. To meet the specification, none of the differences shall exceed the limits specified in Table 2.1-1.</P>
              <P>2.1.6.1.2 Calculations. Summarize the results on a data sheet. An example is shown in Figure 2.1-1. Calculate the differences between the CEMS responses and the reference values.</P>
              <P>2.1.6.2 Response Time. Check the entire CEMS including sample extraction and transport, sample conditioning, gas analyses, and the data recording.</P>
              <P>2.1.6.2.1 Introduce zero gas into the system. For extractive systems, introduce the calibration gases at the probe as near to the sample location as possible. For in-situ system, introduce the zero gas at a point such that all components active in the analysis are tested. When the system output has stabilized (no change greater than 1 percent of full scale for 30 seconds), switch to monitor stack effluent and wait for a stable value. Record the time (upscale response time) required to reach 95 percent of the final stable value.</P>

              <P>2.1.6.4.2.1 Unless otherwise specified in the regulations, method 3 or 3A and method 10, 10A, or 10B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) are the test methods for O<E T="52">2</E> and CO, respectively. Make a sample traverse of at least 21 minutes, sampling for 7 minutes at each of three traverse points (see section 3.2).</P>

              <P>2.1.6.4.2.2 When the installed CEMS uses a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) analyzer, method 10 shall use the alternative interference trap specified in section 10.1 of the method. An option, which may be approved by the Administrator in certain cases, would allow the test to be conducted using method 10 without the interference trap. Under this option, a laboratory interference test is performed for the analyzer prior to the field test. The laboratory interference test includes the analysis of SO<E T="52">2</E>, NO, and CO<E T="52">2</E> calibration gases over the range of expected effluent concentrations. Acceptable performance is indicated if the CO analyzer response to each of the gases is less than 1 percent of the applicable measurement range of the analyzer.</P>
              <P>2.1.6.4.3 Number of PTM Tests. Conduct a minimum of nine sets of all necessary PTM tests. If more than nine sets are conducted, a maximum of three sets may be rejected at the tester's discretion. The total number of sets used to determine the RA must be greater than or equal to nine. All data, including the rejected data, must be reported.</P>

              <P>2.1.6.4.4 Correlation of PTM and CEMS Data. The time and duration of each PTM test run and the CEMS response time should be considered in correlating the data. Use the CEMS final output (the one used for reporting) to determine an integrated average CO concentration for each PTM test run. Confirm that the pair of results are on a consistent moisture and O<E T="52">2</E> concentration basis. Each integrated CEMS value should then be compared against the corresponding average PTM value. If the CO concentration measured by the CEMS is normalized to a specified diluent concentration, the PTM results shall be normalized to the same value.</P>

              <P>2.2.1.1 Applicability. These performance specifications apply to hydrocarbon (HC) continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMSs) installed on incinerators, boilers, and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste. The specifications include procedures which are intended to be used to evaluate the acceptability of the CEMS at the time of its installation or whenever specified in regulations or permits. The procedures are not designed to evaluate CEMS performance over an extended period of time. The source owner or operator is responsible for the proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of the CEMS at all times.</P>

              <P>2.2.1.2 Principle. A gas sample is extracted from the source through a heated sample line and heated filter (except as provided by section 2.2.10) to a flame ionization <PRTPAGE P="93"/>detector (FID). Results are reported as volume concentration equivalents of propane. Installation and measurement location specifications, performance and equipment specifications, test and data reduction procedures, and brief quality assurance guidelines are included in the specifications. Calibration drift, calibration error, and response time tests are conducted to determine conformance of the CEMS with the specifications.</P>

              <P>2.2.3.1 CEMS Installation and Measurement Locations. The CEMS shall be installed in a location in which measurements representative of the source's emissions can be obtained. The optimum location of the sample interface for the CEMS is determined by a number of factors, including ease of access for calibration and maintenance, the degree to which sample conditioning will be required, the degree to which it represents total emissions, and the degree to which it represents the combustion situation in the firebox. The location should be as free from in-leakage influences as possible and reasonably free from severe flow disturbances. The sample location should be at least two equivalent duct diameters downstream from the nearest control device, point of pollutant generation, or other point at which a change in the pollutant concentration or emission rate occurs and at least 0.5 diameter upstream from the exhaust or control device. The equivalent duct diameter is calculated as per 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 1, section 2.1. If these criteria are not achievable or if the location is otherwise less than optimum, the possibility of stratification should be investigated as described in section 2.2.3.2. The measurement point shall be within the centroidal area of the stack or duct cross section.</P>

              <P>2.2.3.2 Stratification Test Procedure. Stratification is defined as a difference in excess of 10 percent between the average concentration in the duct or stack and the concentration at any point more than 1.0 meter from the duct or stack wall. To determine whether effluent stratification exists, a dual probe system should be used to determine the average effluent concentration while measurements at each traverse point are being made. One probe, located at the stack or duct centroid, is used as a stationary reference point to indicate the change in effluent concentration over time. The second probe is used for sampling at the traverse points specified in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, method 1. The monitoring system samples sequentially at the reference and traverse <PRTPAGE P="94"/>points throughout the testing period for five minutes at each point.</P>

Introduce the two calibration gases into the sampling system as close to the sampling probe outlet as practical. The gas shall pass through all CEM components used during normal sampling. If periodic automatic or manual adjustments are made to the CEMS zero and calibration settings, conduct the CD test immediately before these adjustments, or conduct it in such a way that the CD can be determined.

The gases shall be injected as close to the probe as possible to provide a check of the entire sampling system. If an alternative calibration procedure is desired (e.g., direct injections or gas cells), subject to Administrator approval, the adequacy of this alternative procedure may be demonstrated during the initial 7-day CD test. Periodic comparisons of the two procedures are suggested.</P>

                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> The term “congener” refers to any one particular member of the same chemical family; e.g., there are 75 congeners of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. The term “homologue” refers to a group of structurally related chemicals that have the same degree of chlorination. For example, there are eight homologues of CDs, monochlorinated through octachlorinated. Dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans that are chlorinated at the 2,3,7, and 8 positions are denoted as “2378” congeners, except when 2,3,7,8-TCDD is uniquely referred to: e.g., 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF are both referred to as “2378-PeCDFs.”</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>For the purpose of estimating risks posed by emissions from boilers and industrial furnaces, however, specific congeners and homologues must be measured using the specified method and then multiplied by the assigned toxicity equivalence factors (TEFs), using procedures described in “Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures to Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Dibenzofurans (CDDs and CDFs) and 1989 Update,” EPA/625/3-89/016, March 1989. The resulting 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents value is used in the subsequent risk calculations and modeling efforts as discussed in the BIF final rule.</P>
              <P>The procedure for calculating the 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent is as follows:</P>
              <P>1. Using method 23, determine the concentrations of 2,7,3,8-congeners of various PCDDs and PCDFs in the sample.</P>
              <P>2. Multiply the congener concentrations in the sample by the TEF listed in Table 4.0-1 to express the congener concentrations in terms of 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent. Note that congeners not chlorinated at 2,3,7, and 8 positions have a zero toxicity factor in this table.</P>

              <P>The HWCAQSP is a combined calculation/reference table approach for conservatively estimating short-term and annual average facility impacts for stack emissions. The procedure is based on extensive short-term modeling of 11 generic source types and on a set of adjustment factors for estimating annual average concentrations from short-term concentrations. Facility impacts may be determined based on the selected worst-case stack or on multiple stacks, in which the impacts from each stack are estimated separately and then added to produce the total facility impact.</P>
              <P>This procedure is most useful for facilities with multiple stacks, large source-to-property boundary distances, and complex terrain between 1 and 5 km from the facility. To ensure a sufficient degree of conservatism, the HWCAQSP may not be used if any of the five screening procedure limitations listed below are true:</P>
              <P>• The facility is located in a narrow valley less than 1 km wide;</P>
              <P>• The facility has a stack taller than 20 m and is located such that the terrain rises to the stack height within 1 km of the facility;</P>
              <P>• The facility has a stack taller than 20 m and is located within 5 km of the shoreline of a large body of water;</P>
              <P>• The facility property line is within 200 m of the stack and the physical stack height is less than 10 m; or</P>
              <P>• On-site receptors are of concern, and stack height is less than 10 m.</P>
              <P>If any of these criteria are met or the Director determines that this procedure is not appropriate, then detailed site-specific modeling or modeling using the “Screening Procedures for Estimating the Air Quality Impact of Stationary Sources,” EPA-450/4-88-010, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, August 1988, is required. Detailed site-specific dispersion modeling must conform to the EPA “Guidance on Air Quality Models (Revised)”, EPA 450/2-78-027R, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, July 1986. This document provides guidance on both the proper selection and regulatory application of air quality models.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Introduction</HD>
              <P>The Hazardous Waste Combustion Air Quality Screening Procedure (HWCAQSP) (also referred to hereafter as “the screening procedure” or “the procedure”) provides a quick, easy method for estimating maximum (hourly) and annual average ambient air impacts associated with the combustion of hazardous waste. The methodology is conservative in nature and estimates dispersion coefficients <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> based on facility-specific information.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> The term dispersion coefficient refers to the change in ambient air concentration (µg/m<SU>3</SU>) resulting from a source with an emission rate of 1 g/sec.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>The screening procedure can be used to determine emissions limits at sites where the nearest meteorological (STAR) station is not representative of the meteorology at the site. If the screen shows that emissions from the site are adequately protective, then the need to collect site-specific meteorological data can be eliminated.</P>
              <P>The screening procedure is generally most helpful for facilities meeting one or more of the following conditions:</P>
              <P>• Multiple stacks with substantially different release specifications (e.g., stack heights differ by &gt;50 percent, exit temperatures differ by &gt;50 °K, or the exit flow rates differ by more than a factor of 2),</P>

              <P>• Terrain located between 1 km and 5 km from the site increases in elevation by more than the physical height of the shortest stack (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the facility is located in complex terrain), or</P>
              <P>• Significant distance between the facility's stacks and the site boundary [guidance on determining whether a distance is “significant” is provided in Step 6(B) of the procedure].</P>
              <P>Steps 1 through 9 of the screening procedure present a simplified method for determining emissions based on the use of the “worst-case” stack. If the simplified method shows that desired feed rates result in emissions that exceed allowable limits for one or more pollutants, a refined analysis to examine the emissions from each stack can be conducted. This multiple-stack method is presented in Step 10.</P>

              <P>The steps involved in screening methodology are as follows:

              <P>The effective stack height is an important factor in dispersion modeling. The effective stack height is the physical height of the stack plus plume rise. As specified in Step 4, the stack height used to estimate the effective stack height must not exceed GEP requirements. Plume rise is a function of the stack exit gas temperature and flow rate.</P>
              <P>In this analysis, the effective stack height is used to select the generic source that represents the dispersion characteristics of the facility. For facilities located in flat terrain and for all facilities with worst-case stacks less than or equal to 10 meters in height, generic source numbers are selected strictly on the basis of effective stack height. In all other cases, the effective stack height is further adjusted to take into account the terrain rise near the facility. This “terrain-adjusted effective stack height” (TAESH) is then used to select the generic source number that represents the dispersion characteristics of the facility. Follow the steps below to identify the effective stack height, the TAESH (where applicable), and the corresponding generic source number.</P>

                  <SU>5</SU> The delineation of urban and rural areas can be difficult for the residential-type areas listed in Table 5.0-3. The degree of resolution in Table 5.0-3 for residential areas often cannot be identified without conducting site area inspections. This process can require extensive analysis, which, for many applications, can be greatly streamlined without sacrificing confidence in selecting the appropriate urban or rural classification. The fundamental simplifying assumption is based on the premise that many applications will have clear-cut urban/rural designations, i.e., most will be in rural settings that can be definitively characterized through a review of aerial photographs, zoning maps, or U.S. Geological Survey topographical maps.</P>

The maximum average annual dispersion coefficient is approximated by multiplying the maximum hourly dispersion coefficient (identified in Step 7(A)) by the appropriate ratio selection from Table 5.0-6. The generic source number(s) [from Steps 5(C) or 5(E)], urban/rural designation (from Step 6), and the terrain type are used to select the appropriate scaling factor. Use the noncomplex terrain designation for all sources located in flat terrain, for all sources <PRTPAGE P="107"/>where the physical stack height of the worst-case stack is less than or equal to 10 m, for all sources where the worst-case stack is less than the minimum GEP, and for those sources where all of the TAESH values in Step 5(E) are greater than zero. Use the complex terrain designation in all other situations.</P>

              <P>This option is a special case procedure that may be helpful when (1) the facility exceeded the regulatory limits for one or more pollutants, as detailed in Step 9, and (2) the facility has multiple stacks with substantially different emission rates and effective release heights. Only those pollutants that fail the Step 9 screening limits need to be addressed in this exercise.</P>
              <P>This procedure assesses the environmental impacts from each stack and then sums the results to estimate total impacts. This option is conceptually the same as the basic approach (Steps 1 through 9) and does not involve complex calculations. However, it is more time-consuming and is recommended only if the basic approach fails to meet the risk criteria. The procedure is outlined below.</P>

Based on the land use classification of the site (e.g., urban or rural), use either Table 5.0-4 or Table 5.0-5 to determine the appropriate dispersion coefficient for each distance range for each stack. Begin at the minimum fenceline distance indicated in Step 7(B) and record on Worksheet 5.0-1 the dispersion coefficient for each stack/distance range. For stacks located in facilities in flat terrain, the generic source numbers were computed in Step 10(C). For stacks located in facilities in rolling and complex terrain, the generic source numbers were computed in Step 10(D). For flat terrain applications and for stacks with a physical height of less than or equal to 10 meters, only one generic source number is used per stack for all distance ranges. For other situations up to three generic source numbers may be needed per stack (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a unique generic source number per distance range). In <PRTPAGE P="109"/>Tables 5.0-4 and 5.0-5, the dispersion coefficients for distances of 6 km to 20 km are the same for all generic source numbers in order to conservatively represent terrain beyond 5 km (past the limits of the terrain analysis).</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6.1 Introduction</HD>
              <P>This section provides a simplified procedure to classify areas in the vicinity of boilers and industrial furnace sites as urban or rural in order to set risk-based emission limits under subpart H of 40 CFR part 266. Urban/rural classification is needed because dispersion rates differ between urban and rural areas and thus, the risk per unit emission rate differs accordingly. The combination of greater surface roughness (more buildings/structures to generate turbulent mixing) and the greater amount of heat released from the surface in an urban area (generates buoyancy-induced mixing) produces greater rates of dispersion. The emission limit tables in the regulation, therefore, distinguish between urban and rural areas.</P>
              <P>EPA guidance (EPA 1986) <SU>1</SU> provides two alternative procedures to determine whether the character of an area is predominantly urban or rural. One procedure is based on land use typing and the other is based on population density. Both procedures require consideration of characteristics within a 3-km radius from a source, in this case the facility stack(s). The land use typing method is preferred because it more directly relates to the surface characteristics that affect dispersion rates. The remainder of this discussion is, therefore, focused on the land use method.</P>

              <P>While the land use method is more direct, it can also be labor-intensive to apply. For this discussion, the land use method has been simplified so that it is consistent with EPA guidance (EPA 1986; Auer 1978), while streamlining the process for the majority of applications so that a clear-cut decision can be made without the need for detailed analysis. Table 6.0-1 summarizes the simplified approach for classifying areas as urban or rural. As shown, the applicant always has the option of applying standard (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, more detailed) analyses to more accurately distinguish between urban and rural areas. However, the procedure presented here allows for simplified determinations, where appropriate, to expedite the permitting process.</P>

              <P>The land use approach considers four primary land use types: industrial (I), commercial (C), residential (R), and agricultural (A). Within these primary classes, subclasses are identified, as shown in table 6.0-1. The goal is to estimate the percentage of the area within a 3-km radius that is urban type and the percentage that is rural type. Industrial and commercial areas are classified as urban; agricultural areas are classified as rural.</P>
              <P>The delineation of urban and rural areas, however, can be more difficult for the residential type areas shown in table 6.0-1. The degree of resolution shown in table 6.0-1 for residential areas often cannot be identified without conducting site area inspections and/or referring to zoning maps. This process can require extensive analysis, which, for many applications, can be greatly streamlined without sacrificing confidence in selecting the appropriate urban or rural classification.</P>
              <P>The fundamental simplifying assumption is based on the premise that many applications will have clear-cut urban/rural designations, i.e., most will be in rural settings that can be definitively characterized through a brief review of topographical maps. The color coding on USGS topographical maps provides the most effective means of simplifying the typing scheme. The suggested typing designations for the color codes found on topographical maps are as follows:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">
                <E T="03">Green</E> Wooded areas (rural).</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">
                <E T="03">White</E> White areas generally will be treated as rural. This code applies to areas that are unwooded and do not have densely packed structures which would require the pink code (house omission tint). Parks, industrial areas, and unforested rural land will appear as white on the topographical maps. Of these categories, only the industrial areas could potentially be classified <PRTPAGE P="116"/>as urban based on EPA 1986 or Auer 1978. Industrial areas can be easily identified in most cases by the characteristics shown in Figure 6.0-1. For this simplified procedure, white areas that have an industrial classification will be treated as urban areas.</FP>

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.1 Comparison of Waste-Derived Residue to Normal Residue</HD>
              <P>To be eligible for the Bevill exclusion from the definition of hazardous waste under 40 CFR 266.112(b)(1), waste-derived residue must not contain Appendix VIII, Part 261, constituents that could reasonably be attributable to the hazardous waste (toxic constituents) at concentrations significantly higher than in residue generated without burning or processing hazardous waste (normal residue). Concentrations of toxic constituents in normal residue are determined based on analysis of a minimum of 10 samples representing a minimum of 10 days of operation. The statistically-derived concentrations in normal residue are determined as the upper tolerance limit (95% confidence with a 95% proportion of the sample distribution) of the normal residue concentrations. The upper tolerance limit is to be determined as described in Section 7.2 below. If changes in raw materials or fuels could lower the statistically-derived concentrations of toxic constituents of concern, the statistically-derived baseline must be re-established for any such mode of operation with the new raw material or fuel.</P>
              <P>Concentrations of toxic constituents in waste-derived residue are determined based on the analysis of one or more samples collected over a compositing period of not more than 24 hours. Multiple samples of the waste-derived residue may be analyzed or subsamples may be composited for analysis, provided that the sampling period does not exceed 24 hours. If more than one sample is analyzed to characterize the waste-derived residue generated over a 24-hour period, the arithmetic mean of the concentrations must be used as the waste-derived concentration for each constituent.</P>

              <P>The concentration of a toxic constituent in the waste-derived residue is not considered to be significantly higher than in the normal residue (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the residue passes the Bevill test for that constituent) if the concentration in the waste-derived residue does not exceed the statistically-derived concentration.</P>

              <P>The mean and the standard deviation of these measurements, calculated using the above equations, are 11.5 and 2.9, respectively. Assuming that the values are normally distributed, the upper tolerance limit (UTL) is given by:

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">UTL = 11.5 + (2.911)(2.9) = 19.9 ppm</FP>
              
              <P>Thus, if the concentration of constituent A in the waste-derived residue is below 19.9 ppm, then the waste-derived residue is eligible for the Bevill exclusion for constituent A.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">7.3 Normal Distribution Assumption</HD>

              <P>As noted in Section 7.2 above, this statistical approach (use of the upper tolerance limit) for calculation of the concentration in normal residue is based on the assumption that the concentration data are distributed normally. The Agency is aware that concentration data of this type may not always be distributed normally, particularly when concentrations are near the detection limits. There are a number of procedures that can be used to test the distribution of a data set. For example, the Shapiro-Wilk test, examination of a histogram or plot of the data on normal probability paper, and examination of the coefficient of skewness are methods that may be applicable, depending on the nature of the data (References 1 and 2).<PRTPAGE P="118"/>
              </P>
              <P>If the concentration data are not adequately represented by a normal distribution, the data may be transformed to attain a near normal distribution. The Agency has found that concentration data, especially when near detection levels, often exhibit a lognormal distribution. The assumption of a lognormal distribution has been used in various programs at EPA, such as in the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery Land Disposal Restrictions program for determination of BDAT treatment standards. The transformed data may be tested for normality using the procedures identified above. If the transformed data are better represented by a normal distribution than the untransformed data, the transformed data should be used in determining the upper tolerance limit using the procedures in Section 7.2 above.</P>
              <P>In all cases where the owner or operator wishes to use other than an assumption of normally distributed data or believes that use of an alternate statistical approach is appropriate to the specific data set, he/she must provide supporting rationale in the operating record that demonstrates that the data treatment is based upon sound statistical practice.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">7.4 Nondetect Values</HD>
              <P>The Agency is developing guidance regarding the treatment of nondetect values (data where the concentration of the constituent being measured is below the lowest concentration for which the analytical method is valid) in carrying out the statistical determination described above. Until the guidance information is available, facilities may present their own approach to the handling of nondetect data points, but must provide supporting rationale in the operating record for consideration by the Director.</P>

              <P>During interim status, owners or operators of boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste must submit documentation to EPA that certifies that emissions of HCl, C1<E T="52">2</E>, metals, and particulate matter (PM) are not likely to exceed allowable emission rates. See certification of precompliance under 40 CFR 266.103(b). This documentation also establishes interim status feed rate and operating limits for the facility. For the initial certification, estimates of emissions and system removal efficiencies (SREs) can be made to establish the operating limits. Subsequently, owners or operators must use emissions testing to demonstrate that emissions do not exceed allowable levels, and to establish operating limits. See 40 CFR 266.103(c). However, initial estimates of emissions for certification of precompliance can be based on estimated or established SREs.</P>
              <P>The SRE combines the effect of partitioning of the chlorine, metals, or PM and the air pollution control system removal efficiency (APCS RE) for these pollutants. The SRE is defined as:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">SRE = (species input—species emitted) / species input</FP>

              <P>The SRE can be calculated from the partitioning factor (PF) and APCS RE by the following formula:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">SRE = 1—[(PF/l00) × (1—APCS RE/100)]</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">PF = percentage of the pollutant partitioned to the combustion gas</FP>
              

              <P>Estimates of the PF and/or the APCS RE can be based on either EPA's default values or engineering judgement. EPA's default values for the APCS RE for metals, HCl, Cl<E T="52">2</E>, and PM are described in this section. EPA's default values for partitioning of these pollutants are described in section 9.0.</P>
              <P>Guidelines for the use of engineering judgement to estimate APCS REs or PFs are described in section 9.4.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">8.1 APCS RE Default Values for Metals</HD>
              <P>EPA's default assumptions for APCS RE for metals are shown in Table 8.1-1. The default values in the table are conservative estimates of the removal efficiencies for metals in BIFs, depending on the volatility of the metal and the type of APCS.</P>

              <P>The volatility of a metal depends on the temperature, the thermal input, the chlorine <PRTPAGE P="119"/>content of the waste, and the identity and concentration of the metal. Metals that do not vaporize at combustion zone temperatures are classified as “nonvolatile”. Such metals typically enter the APCS in the form of large particles that are removed relatively easily. Metals that vaporize in the combustion zone and condense before entering the APCS are classified as “volatile”. Such metals typically enter the APCS in the form of very fine, submicron particles that are rather inefficiently removed in many APCSs. Metals that vaporize in the combustion zone and do not condense before entering the APCS are classified as “very volatile”. Such metals enter the APCS in the form of a vapor that is very inefficiently removed in many APCSs.</P>
              <P>Typically, BIFs have combustion zone temperatures high enough to vaporize any hazardous metal at concentrations sufficient to exceed risk-based emission limits. For this reason, the default assumption is that there are no nonvolatile metals. Tables 8.1-2 and 8.1-3 are used to determine whether metals are classified as “volatile” or “very volatile” depending on the temperature entering the APCS, the thermal input, and whether the waste is chlorinated or nonchlorinated.</P>

              <P>A waste is considered chlorinated if chlorine is present in concentrations greater than 0.1 percent by weight. In the EPA guidance document “Guidance for Metals and Hydrogen Chloride Controls for Hazardous Waste Incinerators, Volume IV of the Hazardous Waste Incineration Guidance Series,“(1) one percent is used for the chlorinated/nonchlorinated cutoff. However, best engineering judgement, based on examination of pilot-scale data reported by Carroll et al. (2) on the effects of waste chlorine content on metals emissions, suggests that the 1 percent cutoff may not be sufficiently conservative.</P>
              <P>Tables 8.1-2 and 8.1-3 were compiled based on equilibrium calculations. Metals are classified as very volatile at all temperatures above the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the metal is greater than 10 percent of the vapor pressure that results in emissions exceeding the most conservative risk-based emissions limits.</P>

              <P>Default assumptions for APCS RE for HCl in BIFs are shown in Table 8.2-1. This table is identical to the column for other BIFs except that cement kilns have a minimum HCl removal efficiency of 83 percent. Because of the alkaline nature of the raw materials in cement kilns, most of the chlorine is converted to chloride salts. Thus, the minimum APCS RE for HCl for cement kilns is independent of the APCS train.</P>
              <P>Removal efficiency of Cl<E T="52">2</E> for most types of APCS is generally minimal. Therefore, the default assumption for APCS RE for Cl<E T="52">2</E> for all APCSs is 0 percent. This is applicable to all BIFs, including cement kilns.</P>

              <P>Default assumptions for APCS RE for PM are also shown in Table 8.1-4. These figures are conservative estimates of PM removal efficiencies for different types of APCSs. They are identical to the figures in the Nonvolatile APCS RE column for hazardous metals presented in Table 8.1-1 because the same collection mechanisms and collection efficiencies that apply to nonvolatile metals also apply to PM.</P>

              <P>Pollutant partitioning factor estimates can come from two sources: default assumptions or engineering judgement. EPA's default assumptions are discussed below for metals, HCl, Cl<E T="52">2</E>, and PM. The default assumptions are used to conservatively predict the partitioning factor for several types of BIFs. Engineering judgement-based partitioning factor estimates are discussed in section 9.4.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.1 Partitioning Default Value for Metals</HD>
              <P>To be conservative, the Agency is assuming that 100 percent of each metal in each feed stream is partitioned to the combustion gas. Owners/operators may use this default value or a supportable, site-specific value developed following the general guidelines provided in section 9.4.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.2 Special Procedures for Chlorine, HCl, and Cl<E T="52">2</E>
              </HD>

              <P>The Agency has established the special procedures presented below for chlorine because the emission limits are based on the pollutants HCl and Cl<E T="52">2</E> formed from chlorine fed to the combustor. Therefore, the owner/operator must estimate the controlled emission rate of both HCl and Cl<E T="52">2</E> and show that they do not exceed allowable levels.</P>
              <P>1. The default partitioning value for the fraction of chlorine in the total feed streams that is partitioned to combustion gas is 100 percent. Owners/operators may use this default value or a supportable, site-specific value developed following the general guidelines provided in section 9.4.</P>

              <P>2. To determine the partitioning of chlorine in the combustion gas to HCl versus Cl<E T="52">2</E>, either use the default values below or use supportable site-specific values developed following the general guidelines provided in section 9.4.</P>

              <P>• For BIFs excluding halogen acid furnaces (HAFs), with a total feed stream chlorine/hydrogen ratio ≤0.95, the default partitioning factor is 20 percent Cl<E T="52">2</E>, 80 percent HCl.</P>

              <P>• For HAFs and for BIFs with a total feed stream chlorine/hydrogen ratio &gt;0.95, the default partitioning factor is 100 percent Cl<E T="52">2</E>.</P>
              <P>3. To determine the uncontrolled (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, prior to acid gas APCS) emission rate of HCl and Cl<E T="52">2</E>, multiply the feed rate of chlorine times the partitioning factor for each pollutant. Then, for HCl, convert the chlorine emission rate to HCl by multiplying it by the ratio of the molecular weight of HCl to the molecular weight of Cl (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, 36.5/35.5). No conversion is needed for Cl<E T="52">2</E>.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.3 Special Procedures for Ash</HD>

              <P>This section: (1) Explains why ash feed rate limits are not applicable to cement and light-weight aggregate kilns; (2) presents the default partitioning values for ash; and (3) explains how to convert the 0.08 gr/dscf, corrected to 7% O<E T="52">2</E>, PM emission limit to a PM emission rate.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Waiver for Cement and Light-Weight Aggregate Kilns.</E> For cement kilns and light-weight aggregate kilns, raw material feed streams contain the vast majority of the ash input, and a significant amount of the ash in the feed stream is entrained into the kiln exhaust gas. For these devices, the ash content of the hazardous waste stream is expected to have a negligible effect on total ash emissions. For this reason, there is no ash feed rate compliance limit for cement kilns or light-weight aggregate kilns. Nonetheless, cement kilns and light-weight aggregate kilns are required to initially certify that PM emissions are not likely to exceed the PM limit, and subsequently, certify through compliance testing that the PM limit is not exceeded.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Default Partitioning Value for Ash.</E> The default assumption for partitioning of ash depends on the feed stream firing system. There are two methods by which materials may be fired into BIFs: Suspension-firing and bed-firing.</P>
              <P>The suspension category includes atomized and lanced pumpable liquids and suspension-fired pulverized solids. The default partitioning assumption for materials fired by these systems is that 100 percent of the ash partitions to the combustion gas.</P>
              <P>The bed-fired category consists principally of stoker boilers and raw materials (and in some cases containerized hazardous waste) fed into cement and light-weight aggregate kilns. The default partitioning assumption for materials fired on a bed is that 5 percent of the ash partitions to the combustion gas.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Converting the PM Concentration-Based Standard to a PM Mass Emission Rate.</E> The emission limit for BIFs is 0.08 gr/dscf, corrected to 7% 0<E T="52">2</E>, unless a more stringent standard applies [e.g., a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) or a State standard implemented under the State Implementation Plan (SIP)]. To convert the 0.08 gr/dscf standard to a PM mass emission rate:</P>
              <P>1. Determine the flue gas 0<E T="52">2</E> concentration (percent by volume, dry) and flue gas flow rate (dry standard cubic feet per minute); and</P>

              <P>2. Calculate the allowable PM mass emission rate by multiplying the concentration- <PRTPAGE P="122"/>based PM emission standard times the flue gas flow rate times a dilution correction factor equal to [(21-0<E T="52">2</E> concentration from step 1)/(21-7)].</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.4 Use of Engineering Judgement To Estimate Partitioning and APCS RE Values</HD>
              <P>Engineering judgement may be used in place of EPA's conservative default assumptions to estimate partitioning and APCS RE values provided that the engineering judgement is defensible and properly documented. To properly document engineering judgement, the owner/operator must keep a written record of all assumptions and calculations necessary to justify the APCS RE used. The owner/operator must provide this record to the Director upon request and must be prepared to defend the assumptions and calculations used.</P>
              <P>If the engineering judgement is based on emissions testing, the testing will often document the emission rate of a pollutant relative to the feed rate of that pollutant rather than the partitioning factor or APCS RE.</P>
              <P>Examples of situations where the use of engineering judgement may be supportable to estimate a partitioning factor, APCS RE, or SRE include:</P>
              <P>• Using emissions testing data from the facility to support an SRE, even though the testing may not meet full QA/QC procedures (e.g., triplicate test runs). The closer the test results conform with full QA/QC procedures and the closer the operating conditions during the test conform with the established operating conditions for the facility, the more supportable the engineering judgement will be.</P>
              <P>• Applying emissions testing data documenting an SRE for one metal, including nonhazardous surrogate metals to another less volatile metal.</P>
              <P>• Applying emissions testing data documenting an SRE from one facility to a similar facility.</P>
              <P>• Using APCS vendor guarantees of removal efficiency.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">9.5 Restrictions on Use of Test Data</HD>
              <P>The measurement of an SRE or an APCS RE may be limited by the detection limits of the measurement technique. If the emission of a pollutant is undetectable, then the calculation of SRE or APCS RE should be based on the lower limit of detectability. An SRE or APCS RE of 100 percent is not acceptable.</P>
              <P>Further, mass balance data of facility inputs, emissions, and products/residues may not be used to support a partitioning factor, given the inherent uncertainties of such procedures. Partitioning factors other than the default values may be supported based on engineering judgement, considering, for example, process chemistry. Emissions test data may be used to support an engineering judgement-based SRE, which includes both partitioning and APCS RE.</P>

              <P>Under this method, cement kilns and other industrial furnaces that recycle emission control residue back into the furnace must comply with a kiln dust concentration limit (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, a collected particulate matter (PM) limit) for each metal, as well as limits on the maximum feedrates of each of the metals in: (1) pumpable hazardous waste; and (2) all hazardous waste.</P>
              <P>The following subsections describe how this method for controlling metals emissions is to be implemented:</P>
              <P>• Subsection 10.3 discusses the basis of the method and the assumptions upon which it is founded;</P>

              <P>• Appendix A describes the statistical calculations and tests to be used in the method.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">10.3 Basis</HD>
              <P>The viability of this method depends on three fundamental assumptions:</P>
              <P>(1) Variations in the ratio of the metal concentration in the emitted particulate to the metal concentration in the collected kiln dust (referred to as the enrichment factor or EF) for any given metal at any given facility will fall within a normal distribution that can be experimentally determined.</P>
              <P>(2) The metal concentrations in the collected kiln dust can be accurately and representatively measured.</P>
              <P>(3) The facility will remain in compliance with the applicable particulate matter (PM) emission standard.</P>
              <P>Given these assumptions. metal emissions can be related to the measured concentrations in the collected kiln dust by the following equation:</P>
              <MATH DEEP="76" SPAN="2">
                <PRTPAGE P="123"/>
                <MID>EC06NO91.014</MID>

              <P>This equation can be rearranged to calculate a maximum allowable dust metal concentration limit (DMCL) by assuming worst-case conditions that: metal emissions are at the Tier III (or Tier II) limit (see 40 CFR 266.106), and that particulate emissions are at the particulate matter limit (PML):</P>

              </MATH>

              <P>The enrichment factor used in the above equation must be determined experimentally from a minimum of 10 tests in which metal concentrations are measured in kiln dust and stack samples taken simultaneously. This approach provides a range of enrichment factors that can be inserted into a statistical distribution (t-distribution) to determine EF<E T="52">95</E>
                <E T="0112">%</E> and EF<E T="52">99</E>

                <E T="0112">%</E> is the value at which there is a 95% confidence level that the enrichment factor is below this value at any given time. Similarly, EF<E T="52">99</E>
                <E T="0112">%</E> is the value at which there is a 99% confidence level that the enrichment factor is below this value at any given time. EF<E T="52">95</E>
                <E T="0112">%</E> is used to calculate the “violation” dust metal concentration limit (DMCL<E T="52">v</E>):</P>

              <P>If the kiln dust metal concentration is just above this “violation” limit, and the PM emissions are at the PM emissions limit, there is a 5% chance that the metal emissions are above the Tier III limit. In such a case, the facility would be in violation of the metals standard.</P>

              <P>To provide a margin of safety, a second, more conservative kiln dust metal concentration limit is also used. This “conservative” dust metal concentration limit (DMCL<E T="52">c</E>) is calculated using a “safe” enrichment factor (SEF). If EF<E T="52">99</E>

              <P>If the kiln dust metal concentration at a facility is just above the “conservative” limit based on that “safe” enrichment factor provided in Equation 4a, and the PM emissions are at the PM emissions limit, there is a 5% chance that the metal emissions are above one-half the Tier III limit. If the kiln dust metal concentration at the facility is just above the “conservative” limit based on the “safe” enrichment factor provided in Equation 4b, and the PM emissions are at the PM emissions limit, there is a 1% chance that the metal emissions are above the Tier III limit. In either case, the facility would be unacceptably close to a violation. If this situation occurs more than 5% of the time, the facility would be required to rerun the series of 10 tests to determine the enrichment factor. To avoid this expense, the facility would be advised to reduce its metals feedrates or to take other appropriate measures to maintain its kiln dust metal concentrations in compliance with the “conservative” dust metal concentration limits.</P>

              <P>(1) Prepare initial limits and test plans.</P>
              <P>• Determine the Tier III metal emission limit. The Tier II metal emission limit may also be used (see 40 CFR 266.106).</P>

              <P>• Determine the applicable PM emission standard. This standard is the most stringent particulate emission standard that applies to the facility. A facility may elect to restrict itself to an even more stringent self-imposed PM emission standard, particularly if the facility finds that it is easier to control particulate emissions than to reduce the kiln dust concentration of a certain metal (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, lead).</P>
              <P>• Determine which metals need to be monitored (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, all hazardous metals for which Tier III emission limits are lower than PM emission limits—assuming PM is pure metal).</P>
              <P>• Follow the compliance procedures described in Subsection 10.6.</P>
              <P>• Follow appropriate guidelines for preparing test plans and waste analysis plans for the following tests:</P>

              <P>• If the “violation” kiln dust metal concentration limit has been exceeded, a violation of the metals controls under § 266.103(c) has occurred. Notify the Director that a violation has occurred. Hazardous waste may be burned for testing purposes for up to 720 operating hours to support a revised certification of compliance. Note that the Director may grant an extension of the hours of hazardous waste burning under § 266.103(c)(7) if additional burning time is needed to support a revised certification for reasons beyond the control of the owner or operator. Until a revised certification of compliance is submitted to the Director, the feedrate of the metals in violation in total and pumpable hazardous waste feeds is limited to 50% of the previous compliance test limits.</P>

              <P>• If so, the tests to determine the enrichment factors must be repeated (refer to Step 11).</P>
              <P>• This determination is made separately for each metal. For example,</P>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—Four exceedances of any single metal in any 60-day period is not allowed.</FP>
              
              <P>• This determination should be made daily, beginning on the first day of daily monitoring. For example, if four exceedances of any single metal occur in the first four days of daily monitoring, do not wait until the end of the 60-day period; refer immediately to Step 11.</P>
              <P>(11) The tests to determine the enrichment factor must be repeated if: (1) More than three exceedances of the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit occur within any 60 consecutive daily samples; (2) an excursion of the “conservative” kiln dust metal concentration limit occurs in any weekly sample; or (3) a quarterly test indicates that the enrichment factors have increased significantly.</P>
              <P>• The facility must notify the Director if these tests must be repeated.</P>
              <P>• The facility has up to 720 hazardous-waste-burning hours to redetermine the enrichment factors for the metal or metals in question and to recertify (beginning with a return to Step 2). During this period, the facility must reduce the feed rate of the metal in violation by 50%. If the facility has not completed the recertification process within this period, it must stop burning or obtain an extension. Hazardous waste burning may resume only when the recertification process (ending with Step 4) has been completed.</P>
              <P>• Meanwhile, the facility must continue with daily kiln dust metals monitoring (Step 5) and must remain in compliance with the “violation” kiln dust metal concentration limits (Step 9).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are my waste analysis requirements?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Before you treat or store any hazardous wastes, you must obtain a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of the wastes. At a minimum, the analysis must contain all the information needed to treat or store the waste to comply with this part and 40 CFR part 268.</P>
              <P>(1) You may include data in the analysis that was developed under 40 CFR part 261, and published or documented data on the hazardous waste or on hazardous waste generated from similar processes.</P>
              <P>(2) You must repeat the analysis as necessary to ensure that it is accurate and up to date. At a minimum, you must repeat the analysis if the process or operation generating the hazardous wastes has changed.</P>
              <P>(b) You must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan that describes the procedures you will follow to comply with paragraph (a) of this section. You must keep this plan at the facility. If you receive wastes generated from off-site, and are eligible for a standardized permit, you also must have submitted the waste analysis plan with the Notice of Intent. At a minimum, the plan must specify all of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The hazardous waste parameters that you will analyze and the rationale for selecting these parameters (that is, how analysis for these parameters will provide sufficient information on the waste's properties to comply with paragraph (a) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) The test methods you will use to test for these parameters.</P>
              <P>(3) The sampling method you will use to obtain a representative sample of the waste to be analyzed. You may obtain a representative sample using either:</P>
              <P>(i) One of the sampling methods described in appendix I of 40 CFR part 261; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An equivalent sampling method.</P>
              <P>(4) How frequently you will review or repeat the initial analysis of the waste to ensure that the analysis is accurate and up to date.</P>
              <P>(5) Where applicable, the methods you will use to meet the additional waste analysis requirements for specific waste management methods as specified in 40 CFR 264.17, 264.1034(d), 264.1063(d), and 264.1083.</P>

              <P>(a) You must prevent, and minimize the possibility for, livestock and unauthorized people from entering the active portion of your facility.</P>
              <P>(b) Your facility must have:</P>
              <P>(1) A 24-hour surveillance system (for example, television monitoring or surveillance by guards or facility personnel) that continuously monitors and controls entry onto the active portion of the facility; or</P>
              <P>(2) An artificial or natural barrier (for example, a fence in good repair or a fence combined with a cliff) that completely surrounds the active portion of the facility; and</P>
              <P>(3) A means to control entry, at all times, through the gates or other entrances to the active portion of the facility (for example, an attendant, television monitors, locked entrance, or controlled roadway access to the facility).</P>

              <P>(c) You must post a sign at each entrance to the active portion of a facility, and at other prominent locations, in sufficient numbers to be seen from any approach to this active portion. <PRTPAGE P="138"/>The sign must bear the legend “Danger—Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out.” The legend must be in English and in any other language predominant in the area surrounding the facility (for example, facilities in counties bordering the Canadian province of Quebec must post signs in French, and facilities in counties bordering Mexico must post signs in Spanish), and must be legible from a distance of at least 25 feet. You may use existing signs with a legend other than “Danger—Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out” if the legend on the sign indicates that only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the active portion, and that entry onto the active portion can be dangerous.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are my general inspection requirements?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You must inspect your facility for malfunctions and deterioration, operator errors, and discharges that may be causing, or may lead to:</P>
              <P>(1) Release of hazardous waste constituents to the environment; or</P>
              <P>(2) A threat to human health. You must conduct these inspections often enough to identify problems in time to correct them before they result in harm to human health or the environment.</P>
              <P>(b) You must develop and follow a written schedule for inspecting, monitoring equipment, safety and emergency equipment, security devices, and operating and structural equipment (such as dikes and sump pumps) that are important to preventing, detecting, or responding to environmental or human health hazards.</P>
              <P>(1) You must keep this schedule at the facility.</P>
              <P>(2) The schedule must identify the equipment and devices you will inspect and what problems you look for, such as malfunctions or deterioration of equipment (for example, inoperative sump pump, leaking fitting, etc.).</P>
              <P>(3) The frequency of your inspections may vary for the items on the schedule. However, the frequency should be based on the rate of deterioration of the equipment and the probability of an environmental or human health incident if the deterioration, malfunction, or any operator error goes undetected between inspections. Areas subject to spills, such as loading and unloading areas, must be inspected daily when in use. At a minimum, the inspection schedule must include the items and frequencies required in §§ 267.174, 267.193, 267.195, 267.1103, and 40 CFR 264.1033, 264.1052, 264.1053, 264.1058, and 264.1083 through 264.1089, where applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) You must remedy any deterioration or malfunction of equipment or structures that the inspection reveals in time to prevent any environmental or human health hazard. Where a hazard is imminent or has already occurred, you must take remedial action immediately.</P>
              <P>(d) You must record all inspections. You must keep these records for at least three years from the date of inspection. At a minimum, you must include the date and time of the inspection, the name of the inspector, a notation of the observations made, and the date and nature of any repairs or other remedial actions.</P>

              <P>(2) Note any significant discrepancies (as defined in § 267.72(a)) in the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received) on each copy of the manifest or shipping paper. Note that the Agency does not intend that the owner or operator of a facility whose procedures under § 267.13(c) include waste analysis must perform that analysis before signing the shipping paper and giving it to the transporter. Section 267.72(b), however, requires reporting an unreconciled discrepancy discovered during later analysis.</P>
              <P>(3) Immediately give the rail or water (bulk shipment) transporter at least one copy of the manifest or shipping paper (if the manifest has not been received);</P>
              <P>(4) Within 30 days after the delivery, send a copy of the signed and dated manifest to the generator; however, if the manifest has not been received within 30 days after delivery, the owner or operator, or his agent, must send a copy of the shipping paper signed and dated to the generator. Note that § 262.23(c) of this chapter requires the generator to send three copies of the manifest to the facility when hazardous waste is sent by rail or water (bulk shipment); and</P>
              <P>(5) Retain at the facility a copy of the manifest and shipping paper (if signed in lieu of the manifest at the time of delivery) for at least three years from the date of delivery.</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever a shipment of hazardous waste is initiated from a facility, the owner or operator of that facility must comply with the requirements of part 262 of this chapter. The Agency notes that the provisions of § 262.16 or 262.17 are applicable to the on-site accumulation of hazardous wastes by generators. Therefore, the provisions of § 262.16 or 262.17 only apply to owners or operators who are shipping hazardous waste which they generated at that facility.</P>

              <P>(d) As per 40 CFR 262.84(d)(2)(xv), within three (3) working days of the receipt of a shipment subject to 40 CFR part 262, subpart H, the owner or operator of a facility must provide a copy of the movement document bearing all required signatures to the foreign exporter; to the competent authorities of the countries of export and transit that control the shipment as an export and transit shipment of hazardous waste <PRTPAGE P="145"/>respectively; and on or after the electronic import-export reporting compliance date, to EPA electronically using EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system. The original copy of the movement document must be maintained at the facility for at least three (3) years from the date of signature. The owner or operator of a facility may satisfy this recordkeeping requirement by retaining electronically submitted documents in the facility's account on EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, provided that copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any EPA or authorized state inspector. No owner or operator of a facility may be held liable for the inability to produce the documents for inspection under this section if the owner or operator of a facility can demonstrate that the inability to produce the document is due exclusively to technical difficulty with EPA's Waste Import Export Tracking System (WIETS), or its successor system, for which the owner or operator of a facility bears no responsibility.</P>

              <P>(a) Manifest discrepancies are differences between the quantity or type of hazardous waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity or type of hazardous waste a facility actually receives. Significant discrepancies in quantity are:</P>
              <P>(1) For bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight; and</P>
              <P>(2) For batch waste, any variation in piece count, such as a discrepancy of one drum in a truckload. Significant discrepancies in type are obvious differences which can be discovered by inspection or waste analysis, such as waste solvent substituted for waste acid, or toxic constituents not reported on the manifest or shipping paper.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon discovering a significant discrepancy, the owner or operator must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or transporter (e.g., with telephone conversations). If the discrepancy is not resolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, the owner or operator must immediately submit to the Regional Administrator a letter describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What must I do to address corrective action for solid waste management units?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You must institute corrective action as necessary to protect human health and the environment for all releases of hazardous waste or constituents from any solid waste management unit at the facility, regardless of the time at which waste was placed in such unit.</P>
              <P>(b) The Regional Administrator will specify corrective action in the supplemental portion of your standardized permit in accordance with this section and 40 CFR part 264, subpart S. The Regional Administrator will include in the supplemental portion of your standardized permit schedules of compliance for corrective action (where corrective action cannot be completed prior to issuance of the permit) and assurances of financial responsibility for completing corrective action.</P>
              <P>(c) You must implement corrective action beyond the facility property boundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator that, despite your best efforts, you were unable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake such actions. You are not relieved of all responsibility to clean up a release that has migrated beyond the facility boundary where off -site access is denied. On-site measures to address such releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis. You must provide assurances of financial responsibility for such corrective action.</P>

              <P>(a) To close a facility, you must follow your approved closure plan, and follow notification requirements.</P>
              <P>(1) Your closure plan must be submitted at the time you submitted your Notice of Intent to operate under a standardized permit. Final issuance of the standardized permit constitutes approval of the closure plan, and the plan becomes a condition of the RCRA standardized permit.</P>

              <P>(2) The Director's approval of the plan must ensure that the approved plan is consistent with §§ 267.111 <PRTPAGE P="148"/>through 267.115, 267.176, 267.201, and 267.1108.</P>
              <P>(b) Satisfy the requirements for content of closure plan. The closure plan must identify steps necessary to perform partial and/or final closure of the facility. The closure plan must include, at least:</P>
              <P>(1) A description of how each hazardous waste management unit at the facility subject to this subpart will be closed following § 267.111.</P>
              <P>(2) A description of how final closure of the facility will be conducted in accordance with § 267.111. The description must identify the maximum extent of the operations which will be unclosed during the active life of the facility.</P>
              <P>(3) An estimate of the maximum inventory of hazardous wastes ever on site during the active life of the facility and a detailed description of the methods you will use during partial and/or final closure, such as methods for removing, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of all hazardous wastes, and identification of the type(s) of off-site hazardous waste management units to be used, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) A detailed description of the steps needed to remove or decontaminate all hazardous waste residues and contaminated containment system components, equipment, structures, and soils during partial or final closure. These might include procedures for cleaning equipment and removing contaminated soils, methods for sampling and testing surrounding soils, and criteria for determining the extent of decontamination required to satisfy the closure performance standard;</P>
              <P>(5) A detailed description of other activities necessary during the closure period to ensure that partial or final closure satisfies the closure performance standards.</P>
              <P>(6) A schedule for closure of each hazardous waste management unit, and for final closure of the facility. The schedule must include, at a minimum, the total time required to close each hazardous waste management unit and the time required for intervening closure activities that allow tracking of progress of partial or final closure.</P>
              <P>(7) For facilities that use trust funds to establish financial assurance under § 267.143 and that are expected to close prior to the expiration of the permit, an estimate of the expected year of final closure.</P>
              <P>(c) You may submit a written notification to the Director for a permit modification to amend the closure plan at any time prior to the notification of partial or final closure of the facility, following the applicable procedures in 40 CFR 124.211.</P>
              <P>(1) Events leading to a change in the closure plan, and therefore requiring a modification, may include:</P>
              <P>(i) A change in the operating plan or facility design;</P>
              <P>(ii) A change in the expected year of closure, if applicable; or</P>
              <P>(iii) In conducting partial or final closure activities, an unexpected event requiring a modification of the approved closure plan.</P>
              <P>(2) The written notification or request must include a copy of the amended closure plan for review or approval by the Director. The Director will approve, disapprove, or modify this amended plan in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 124.211 and 270.320.</P>
              <P>(d) Notification before final closure. (1) You must notify the Director in writing at least 45 days before the date that you expect to begin final closure of a treatment or storage tank, container storage area, or containment building.</P>
              <P>(2) The date when you “expect to begin closure” must be no later than 30 days after the date that any hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of hazardous wastes.</P>
              <P>(3) If your facility's permit is terminated, or if you are otherwise ordered, by judicial decree or final order under section 3008 of RCRA, to cease receiving hazardous wastes or to close, then the requirements of this paragraph (d) do not apply. However, you must close the facility following the deadlines established in § 267.115.</P>

              <P>(f) The following terms are used in the specifications for the financial tests for closure and liability coverage. The definitions are intended to assist in the understanding of these regulations and are not intended to limit the meanings of terms in a way that conflicts with generally accepted accounting practices:</P>

              <P>(g) In the liability insurance requirements, the terms <E T="03">bodily injury and property damage</E> shall have the meanings given these terms by applicable State law. However, these terms do not include those liabilities which, consistent with standard industry practices, are excluded from coverage in liability policies for bodily injury and property damage. The Agency intends the meanings of other terms used in the liability insurance requirements to be consistent with their common meanings within the insurance industry. The definitions given below of several of the terms are intended to assist in the understanding of these regulations and are not intended to limit their meanings in a way that conflicts with general insurance industry usage.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 267.142</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Cost estimate for closure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The owner or operator must have at the facility a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of closing the facility in accordance with the requirements in §§ 267.111 through 267.115 and applicable closure requirements in §§ 267.176, 267.201, 267.1108.</P>

              <P>(1) The estimate must equal the cost of final closure at the point in the facility's active life when the extent and manner of its operation would make <PRTPAGE P="151"/>closure the most expensive, as indicated by the closure plan (see § 267.112(b)); and</P>
              <P>(2) The closure cost estimate must be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a third party to close the facility. A third party is a party who is neither a parent nor a subsidiary of the owner or operator. (See definition of parent corporation in § 267.141(d).) The owner or operator may use costs for on-site disposal if he can demonstrate that on-site disposal capacity will exist at all times over the life of the facility.</P>
              <P>(3) The closure cost estimate may not incorporate any salvage value that may be realized with the sale of hazardous wastes, or non-hazardous wastes, facility structures or equipment, land, or other assets associated with the facility at the time of partial or final closure.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator may not incorporate a zero cost for hazardous wastes, or non-hazardous wastes that might have economic value.</P>
              <P>(b) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must adjust the closure cost estimate for inflation within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the financial instrument(s) used to comply with § 267.143. For owners and operators using the financial test or corporate guarantee, the closure cost estimate must be updated for inflation within 30 days after the close of the firm's fiscal year and before submission of updated information to the Regional Administrator as specified in § 267.143(f)(2)(iii). The adjustment may be made by recalculating the maximum costs of closure in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from the most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic Product published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in its Survey of Current Business, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. The inflation factor is the result of dividing the latest published annual Deflator by the Deflator for the previous year.</P>
              <P>(1) The first adjustment is made by multiplying the closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is the adjusted closure cost estimate.</P>
              <P>(2) Subsequent adjustments are made by multiplying the latest adjusted closure cost estimate by the latest inflation factor.</P>
              <P>(c) During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator must revise the closure cost estimate no later than 30 days after the Regional Administrator has approved the request to modify the closure plan, if the change in the closure plan increases the cost of closure. The revised closure cost estimate must be adjusted for inflation as specified in § 267.142(b).</P>
              <P>(d) The owner or operator must keep the following at the facility during the operating life of the facility: The latest closure cost estimate prepared in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section and, when this estimate has been adjusted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the latest adjusted closure cost estimate.</P>
            </SECTION>

              <SECTNO>§ 267.143</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Financial assurance for closure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The owner or operator must establish financial assurance for closure of each storage or treatment unit that he owns or operates. In establishing financial assurance for closure, the owner or operator must choose from the financial assurance mechanisms in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section. The owner or operator can also use a combination of mechanisms for a single facility if they meet the requirement in paragraph (h) of this section, or may use a single mechanism for multiple facilities as in paragraph (i) of this section. The Regional Administrator will release the owner or operator from the requirements of this section after the owner or operator meets the criteria under paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Closure Trust Fund.</E> Owners and operators can use the “closure trust fund,” that is specified in 40 CFR 264.143(a)(1) and (2), and 264.143(a)(6)-(11). For purposes of this paragraph, the following provisions also apply:</P>

              <P>(1) Payments into the trust fund for a new facility must be made annually by the owner or operator over the remaining operating life of the facility as estimated in the closure plan, or over 3 years, whichever period is shorter. This <PRTPAGE P="152"/>period of time is hereafter referred to as the “pay-in period.”</P>

              <P>(2) For a new facility, the first payment into the closure trust fund must be made before the facility may accept the initial storage. A receipt from the trustee must be submitted by the owner or operator to the Regional Administrator before this initial storage of waste. The first payment must be at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, divided by the number of years in the pay-in period, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section for multiple mechanisms. Subsequent payments must be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The owner or operator determines the amount of each subsequent payment by subtracting the current value of the trust fund from the current closure cost estimate, and dividing this difference by the number of years remaining in the pay-in period. Mathematically, the formula is
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Next Payment = (Current Closure Estimate − Current Value of the Trust Fund) Divided by Years Remaining in the Pay-In Period.</FP>
              
              <P>(3) The owner or operator of a facility existing on the effective date of this paragraph can establish a trust fund to meet this paragraph's financial assurance requirements. If the value of the trust fund is less than the current closure cost estimate when a final approval of the permit is granted for the facility, the owner or operator must pay the difference into the trust fund within 60 days.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator may accelerate payments into the trust fund or deposit the full amount of the closure cost estimate when establishing the trust fund. However, he must maintain the value of the fund at no less than the value that the fund would have if annual payments were made as specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The owner or operator must submit a trust agreement with the wording specified in 40 CFR 264.151(a)(1).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Surety Bond Guaranteeing Payment into a Closure Trust Fund.</E> Owners and operators can use the “surety bond guaranteeing payment into a closure trust fund,” as specified in 40 CFR 264.143(b), including the use of the surety bond instrument specified at 40 CFR 264.151(b), and the standby trust specified at 40 CFR 264.143(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Surety Bond Guaranteeing Performance of Closure.</E> Owners and operators can use the “surety bond guaranteeing performance of closure,” as specified in 40 CFR 264.143(c), the submission and use of the surety bond instrument specified at 40 CFR 264.151(c), and the standby trust specified at 40 CFR 264.143(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Closure Letter of Credit.</E> Owners and operators can use the “closure letter of credit” specified in 40 CFR 264.143(d), the submission and use of the irrevocable letter of credit instrument specified in 40 CFR 264.151(d), and the standby trust specified in 40 CFR 264.143(d)(3).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Closure Insurance.</E> Owners and operators can use “closure insurance,” as specified in 40 CFR 264.143(e), utilizing the certificate of insurance for closure specified at 40 CFR 264.151(e).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Corporate financial test.</E> An owner or operator that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph may demonstrate financial assurance up to the amount specified in this paragraph:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Financial component.</E> (i) The owner or operator must satisfy one of the following three conditions:</P>
              <P>(A) A current rating for its senior unsecured debt of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A or Baa as issued by Moody's; or</P>
              <P>(B) A ratio of less than 1.5 comparing total liabilities to net worth; or</P>
              <P>(C) A ratio of greater than 0.10 comparing the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization, minus $10 million, to total liabilities.</P>
              <P>(ii) The tangible net worth of the owner or operator must be greater than:</P>
              <P>(A) The sum of the current environmental obligations (see paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this section), including guarantees, covered by a financial test plus $10 million, except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>

              <P>(B) $10 million in tangible net worth plus the amount of any guarantees <PRTPAGE P="153"/>that have not been recognized as liabilities on the financial statements provided all of the environmental obligations (see paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this section) covered by a financial test are recognized as liabilities on the owner's or operator's audited financial statements, and subject to the approval of the Regional Administrator.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner or operator must have assets located in the United States amounting to at least the sum of environmental obligations covered by a financial test as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(A)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</E> (i) The owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:</P>
              <P>(A) A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer that:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Lists all the applicable current types, amounts, and sums of environmental obligations covered by a financial test. These obligations include both obligations in the programs which EPA directly operates and obligations where EPA has delegated authority to a State or approved a State's program. These obligations include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Liability, closure, post-closure and corrective action cost estimates required for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under 40 CFR 264.101, 264.142, 264.144, 264.147, 265.142, 265.144, and 265.147;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Cost estimates required for municipal solid waste management facilities under 40 CFR 258.71, 258.72, and 258.73;</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) Cost estimates required for PCB storage facilities under 40 CFR 761.65;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">vi</E>) Any financial assurance required under, or as part of an action undertaken under, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">vii</E>) Any other environmental obligations that are assured through a financial test.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Provides evidence demonstrating that the firm meets the conditions of either paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) or (f)(1)(i)(B) or (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section and paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) A copy of the independent certified public accountant's unqualified opinion of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year. To be eligible to use the financial test, the owner's or operator's financial statements must receive an unqualified opinion from the independent certified public accountant. An adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or other qualified opinion will be cause for disallowance, with the potential exception for qualified opinions provided in the next sentence. The Regional Administrator may evaluate qualified opinions on a case-by-case basis and allow use of the financial test in cases where the Regional Administrator deems that the matters which form the basis for the qualification are insufficient to warrant disallowance of the test. If the Regional Administrator does not allow use of the test, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section within 30 days after the notification of disallowance.</P>

              <P>(C) If the chief financial officer's letter providing evidence of financial assurance includes financial data showing that the owner or operator satisfies paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) or (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section that are different from data in the audited financial statements referred to in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section or any other audited financial statement or data filed with the SEC, then a special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator is required. The special report shall be based upon an agreed upon procedures engagement in accordance with professional auditing standards and shall describe the procedures performed in comparing the data in the chief financial officer's letter derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements, the findings of that comparison, and the reasons for any differences.<PRTPAGE P="154"/>
              </P>
              <P>(D) If the chief financial officer's letter provides a demonstration that the firm has assured for environmental obligations as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, then the letter shall include a report from the independent certified public accountant that verifies that all of the environmental obligations covered by a financial test have been recognized as liabilities on the audited financial statements, how these obligations have been measured and reported, and that the tangible net worth of the firm is at least $10 million plus the amount of any guarantees provided.</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator of a new facility must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before placing waste in the facility.</P>
              <P>(iii) After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year. The Regional Administrator may provide up to an additional 45 days for an owner or operator who can demonstrate that 90 days is insufficient time to acquire audited financial statements. The updated information must consist of all items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in this paragraph (f)(2) of this section or comply with the requirements of this paragraph (f) when:</P>
              <P>(A) The owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section that is not subject to these recordkeeping and reporting requirements; or</P>
              <P>(B) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) An owner or operator who no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section cannot use the financial test to demonstrate financial assurance. Instead an owner or operator who no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, must:</P>
              <P>(A) Send notice to the Regional Administrator of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section. The owner or operator must send this notice by certified mail within 90 days following the close the owner or operator's fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) Provide alternative financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(vi) The Regional Administrator may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, require at any time the owner or operator to provide reports of its financial condition in addition to or including current financial test documentation as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If the Regional Administrator finds that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Corporate Guarantee.</E> (1) An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee. The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraph (f) of this section and must comply with the terms of the guarantee. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording in 40 CFR 264.151(h). The certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer and accountants' opinions. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator, this letter must describe <PRTPAGE P="155"/>this “substantial business relationship” and the value received in consideration of the guarantee.</P>
              <P>(2) For a new facility, the guarantee must be effective and the guarantor must submit the items in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and the items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before the owner or operator places waste in the facility.</P>
              <P>(3) The terms of the guarantee must provide that:</P>
              <P>(i) If the owner or operator fails to perform closure at a facility covered by the guarantee, the guarantor will:</P>
              <P>(A) Perform, or pay a third party to perform closure (performance guarantee); or</P>
              <P>(B) Establish a fully funded trust fund as specified in paragraph (a) of this section in the name of the owner or operator (payment guarantee).</P>
              <P>(ii) The guarantee will remain in force for as long as the owner or operator must comply with the applicable financial assurance requirements of this subpart unless the guarantor sends prior notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or operator and to the Regional Administrator. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator as evidenced by the return receipts.</P>
              <P>(iii) If notice of cancellation is given, the owner or operator must, within 90 days following receipt of the cancellation notice by the owner or operator and the Regional Administrator, obtain alternate financial assurance, and submit documentation for that alternate financial assurance to the Regional Administrator. If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance and obtain the written approval of such alternative assurance from the Regional Administrator within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate assurance in the name of the owner or operator and submit the necessary documentation for the alternative assurance to the Regional Administrator within 120 days of the cancellation notice.</P>
              <P>(4) If a corporate guarantor no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must, within 90 days, obtain alternative assurance, and submit the assurance to the Regional Administrator for approval. If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial assurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate assurance within the next 30 days, and submit it to the Regional Administrator for approval.</P>
              <P>(5) The guarantor is no longer required to meet the requirements of this paragraph (g) when:</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator is released from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Use of Multiple Financial Mechanisms.</E> An owner or operator may use more than one mechanism at a particular facility to satisfy the requirements of this section. The acceptable mechanisms are trust funds, surety bonds guaranteeing payment into a trust fund, letters of credit, insurance, the financial test, and the guarantee, except owners or operators cannot combine the financial test with the guarantee. The mechanisms must be as specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) respectively of this section, except it is the combination of mechanisms rather than a single mechanism that must provide assurance for an amount at least equal to the cost estimate. If an owner or operator uses a trust fund in combination with a surety bond or letter of credit, he may use the trust fund as the standby trust for the other mechanisms. A single trust fund can be established for two or more mechanisms. The Regional Administrator may use any or all of the mechanisms to provide for closure of the facility.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Use of a financial mechanism for multiple facilities.</E> An owner or operator may use a financial mechanism for multiple facilities, as specified in § 264.143(h) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Release of the owner or operator from the requirements of this section.</E> Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent registered professional <PRTPAGE P="156"/>engineer that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that the owner or operator is no longer required by this section to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility, unless the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that final closure has not been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan. The Regional Administrator shall provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement of any such reasons to believe that closure has not been conducted in accordance with the approved closure plan.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Coverage for sudden accidental occurrences.</E> An owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment or storage facility, or a group of such facilities, must demonstrate financial responsibility for bodily injury and property damage to third parties caused by sudden accidental occurrences arising from operations of the facility or group of facilities. The owner or operator must have and maintain liability coverage for sudden accidental occurrences in the amount of at least $1 million per occurrence with an annual aggregate of at least $2 million, exclusive of legal defense costs. This liability coverage may be demonstrated as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Trust fund for liability coverage.</E> An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a trust fund for liability coverage as specified in 40 CFR 264.147(j).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Surety bond for liability coverage.</E> An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a surety bond for liability coverage as specified in 40 CFR 264.147(i).</P>

              <P>(6) <E T="03">Guarantee for liability coverage.</E> An owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a guarantee as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Combination of mechanisms.</E> An owner or operator may demonstrate the required liability coverage through the use of combinations of mechanisms as allowed by 40 CFR 264.147(a)(6).</P>
              <P>(8) An owner or operator shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing within 30 days whenever:</P>
              <P>(i) A claim results in a reduction in the amount of financial assurance for liability coverage provided by a financial instrument authorized in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A Certification of Valid Claim for bodily injury or property damages caused by a sudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is entered between the owner or operator and third-party claimant for liability coverage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(iii) A final court order establishing a judgment for bodily injury or property damage caused by a sudden accidental occurrence arising from the operation of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility is issued against the owner or operator or an instrument that is providing financial assurance for liability coverage under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b)-(d) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Period of coverage.</E> Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent registered professional engineer that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan, the Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing that he is no longer required by this section to maintain liability coverage from that facility, unless the Regional <PRTPAGE P="157"/>Administrator has reason to believe that closure has not been in accordance with the approved closure plan.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Financial test for Liability Coverage.</E> An owner or operator that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (f) may demonstrate financial assurance for liability up to the amount specified in this paragraph (f):</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Financial component.</E> (i) If using the financial test for only liability coverage, the owner or operator must have tangible net worth greater than the sum of the liability coverage to be demonstrated by this test plus $10 million.</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator must have assets located in the United States amounting to at least the amount of liability covered by this financial test.</P>
              <P>(iii) An owner or operator who is demonstrating coverage for liability and any other environmental obligations, including closure under § 267.143(f), through a financial test must meet the requirements of § 267.143(f).</P>
              <P>(2) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</P>
              <P>(i) The owner or operator must submit the following items to the Regional Administrator:</P>
              <P>(A) A letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer that provides evidence demonstrating that the firm meets the conditions of paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (f)(1)(ii) of this section. If the firm is providing only liability coverage through a financial test for a facility or facilities with a permit under § 267, the letter should use the wording in § 267.151(b). If the firm is providing only liability coverage through a financial test for facilities regulated under part 267 and also part 264 or part 265, it should use the letter in § 264.151(g). If the firm is providing liability coverage through a financial test for a facility or facilities with a permit under § 267, and it assures closure costs or any other environmental obligations through a financial test, it must use the letter in § 267.151(a) for the facilities issued a permit under § 267.</P>
              <P>(B) A copy of the independent certified public accountant's unqualified opinion of the owner's or operator's financial statements for the latest completed fiscal year. To be eligible to use the financial test, the owner's or operator's financial statements must receive an unqualified opinion from the independent certified public accountant. An adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or other qualified opinion will be cause for disallowance, with the potential exception for qualified opinions provided in the next sentence. The Regional Administrator may evaluate qualified opinions on a case-by-case basis and allow use of the financial test in cases where the Regional Administrator deems that the matters which form the basis for the qualification are insufficient to warrant disallowance of the test. If the Regional Administrator does not allow use of the test, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section (§ 267.147) within 30 days after the notification of disallowance.</P>
              <P>(C) If the chief financial officer's letter providing evidence of financial assurance includes financial data showing that the owner or operator satisfies paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section that are different from data in the audited financial statements referred to in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section or any other audited financial statement or data filed with the SEC, then a special report from the owner's or operator's independent certified public accountant to the owner or operator is required. The special report shall be based upon an agreed upon procedures engagement in accordance with professional auditing standards and shall describe the procedures performed in comparing the data in the chief financial officer's letter derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year with the amounts in such financial statements, the findings of that comparison, and the reasons for any differences.</P>
              <P>(ii) The owner or operator of a new facility must submit the items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section to the Regional Administrator at least 60 days before placing waste in the facility.</P>

              <P>(iii) After the initial submission of items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the owner or operator <PRTPAGE P="158"/>must send updated information to the Regional Administrator within 90 days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year. The Regional Administrator may provide up to an additional 45 days for an owner or operator who can demonstrate that 90 days is insufficient time to acquire audited financial statements. The updated information must consist of all items specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) The owner or operator is no longer required to submit the items specified in this paragraph (f)(2) or comply with the requirements of this paragraph (f) when:</P>
              <P>(A) The owner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as specified in this section that is not subject to these recordkeeping and reporting requirements; or</P>
              <P>(B) The Regional Administrator releases the owner or operator from the requirements of this section in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) An owner or operator who no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section cannot use the financial test to demonstrate financial assurance. An owner or operator who no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, must:</P>
              <P>(A) Send notice to the Regional Administrator of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified in this section. The owner or operator must send this notice by certified mail within 90 days following the close of the owner or operator's fiscal year for which the year-end financial data show that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) Provide alternative financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(vi) The Regional Administrator may, based on a reasonable belief that the owner or operator may no longer meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, require at any time the owner or operator to provide reports of its financial condition in addition to or including current financial test documentation as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If the Regional Administrator finds that the owner or operator no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the owner or operator must provide alternate financial assurance that meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Guarantee for liability coverage.</E> (1) Subject to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may meet the requirements of this section by obtaining a written guarantee, hereinafter referred to as “guarantee.” The guarantor must be the direct or higher-tier parent corporation of the owner or operator, a firm whose parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, or a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator. The guarantor must meet the requirements for owners or operators in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. The wording of the guarantee must be identical to the wording specified in 40 CFR 264.151(h)(2). A certified copy of the guarantee must accompany the items sent to the Regional Administrator as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. One of these items must be the letter from the guarantor's chief financial officer. If the guarantor's parent corporation is also the parent corporation of the owner or operator, this letter must describe the value received in consideration of the guarantee. If the guarantor is a firm with a “substantial business relationship” with the owner or operator, this letter must describe this “substantial business relationship” and the value received in consideration of the guarantee.</P>
              <P>(i) If the owner or operator fails to satisfy a judgment based on a determination of liability for bodily injury or property damage to third parties caused by sudden accidental occurrences arising from the operation of facilities covered by this corporate guarantee, or fails to pay an amount agreed to in settlement of claims arising from or alleged to arise from such injury or damage, the guarantor will do so up to the limits of coverage.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(2)(i) In the case of corporations incorporated in the United States, a guarantee may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section only if the Attorneys General or Insurance Commissioners of the State in which the <PRTPAGE P="159"/>guarantor is incorporated, and each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located, have submitted a written statement to EPA that a guarantee executed as described in this section and 40 CFR 264.151(h)(2) is a legally valid and enforceable obligation in that State.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of corporations incorporated outside the United States, a guarantee may be used to satisfy the requirements of this section only if:</P>
              <P>(A) The non-U.S. corporation has identified a registered agent for service of process in each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located and in the State in which it has its principal place of business; and</P>
              <P>(B) The Attorney General or Insurance Commissioner of each State in which a facility covered by the guarantee is located and the State in which the guarantor corporation has its principal place of business, has submitted a written statement to EPA that a guarantee executed as described in this section and 40 CFR 264.151(h)(2) is a legally valid and enforceable obligation in that State.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Incapacity of owners or operators, guarantors, or financial institutions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator by certified mail of the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming the owner or operator as debtor, within 10 days after commencement of the proceeding. A guarantor of a corporate guarantee as specified in §§ 267.143(g) and 267.147 (g) must make such a notification if he is named as debtor, as required under the terms of the corporate guarantee (§ 264.151(h)).</P>
              <P>(b) An owner or operator who fulfills the requirements of § 267.143 or § 267.147 by obtaining a trust fund, surety bond, letter of credit, or insurance policy will be deemed to be without the required financial assurance or liability coverage in the event of bankruptcy of the trustee or issuing institution, or a suspension or revocation of the authority of the trustee institution to act as trustee or of the institution issuing the surety bond, letter of credit, or insurance policy to issue such instruments. The owner or operator must establish other financial assurance or liability coverage within 60 days after such an event.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State assumption of responsibility.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) If a State either assumes legal responsibility for an owner's or operator's compliance with the closure care or liability requirements of this part or assures that funds will be available from State sources to cover those requirements, the owner or operator will be in compliance with the requirements of § 267.143 or § 267.147 if the Regional Administrator determines that the State's assumption of responsibility is at least equivalent to the financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator will evaluate the equivalency of State guarantees principally in terms of: Certainty of the availability of funds for the required closure care activities or liability coverage; and the amount of funds that will be made available. The Regional Administrator may also consider other factors as he deems appropriate. The owner or operator must submit to the Regional Administrator a letter from the State describing the nature of the State's assumption of responsibility together with a letter from the owner or operator requesting that the State's assumption of responsibility be considered acceptable for meeting the requirements of this subpart. The letter from the State must include, or have attached to it, the following information: The facility's EPA Identification Number, name, and address, and the amount of funds for closure care or liability coverage that are guaranteed by the State. The Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator of his determination regarding the acceptability of the State's guarantee in lieu of financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator may require the owner or operator to submit additional information as is deemed necessary to make this determination. Pending this determination, the owner or operator <PRTPAGE P="160"/>will be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of § 267.143 or § 267.147, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) If a State's assumption of responsibility is found acceptable as specified in paragraph (a) of this section except for the amount of funds available, the owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this subpart by use of both the State's assurance and additional financial mechanisms as specified in this subpart. The amount of funds available through the State and Federal mechanisms must at least equal the amount required by this subpart.</P>

              <P>This subpart applies to you if you own or operate a facility that treats or stores hazardous waste in containers under a 40 CFR part 270 subpart J standardized permit, except as provided in § 267.1(b).</P>

              <P>Standards apply to the condition of the containers, to the compatibility of waste with the containers, and to the management of the containers.</P>
              <P>(a) Condition of containers. If a container holding hazardous waste is not in good condition (for example, it exhibits severe rusting or apparent structural defects) or if it begins to leak, you must either:</P>
              <P>(1) Transfer the hazardous waste from this container to a container that is in good condition; or</P>
              <P>(2) Manage the waste in some other way that complies with the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Compatibility of waste with containers. To ensure that the ability of the container to contain the waste is not impaired, you must use a container made of or lined with materials that are compatible and will not react with the hazardous waste to be stored.</P>
              <P>(c) Management of containers. (1) You must always keep a container holding hazardous waste closed during storage, except when you add or remove waste.</P>
              <P>(2) You must never open, handle, or store a container holding hazardous waste in a manner that may rupture the container or cause it to leak.</P>

              <P>(a) You must design and operate a containment system for your container storage areas according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, except as otherwise provided by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The design and operating requirements for a containment system are:</P>
              <P>(1) A base must underlie the containers that is free of cracks or gaps and is sufficiently impervious to contain leaks, spills, and accumulated precipitation until the collected material is detected and removed.</P>
              <P>(2) The base must be sloped or the containment system, must be otherwise designed and operated to drain and remove liquids resulting from leaks, spills, or precipitation, unless the containers are elevated or are otherwise protected from contact with accumulated liquids.</P>

              <P>(2) Prevent failure due to:</P>
              <P>(i) Pressure gradients, settlement, compression, or uplift.</P>
              <P>(ii) Physical contact with the hazardous wastes to which they are exposed.</P>
              <P>(iii) Climatic conditions.</P>
              <P>(iv) Stresses of daily operation, including the movement of heavy equipment within the unit and contact of such equipment with containment walls.</P>
              <P>(v) Collapse or other failure.</P>
              <P>(c) All surfaces to be in contact with hazardous wastes must be chemically compatible with those wastes.</P>
              <P>(d) You must not place incompatible hazardous wastes or treatment reagents in the unit or its secondary containment system if they could cause the unit or secondary containment system to leak, corrode, or otherwise fail.</P>
              <P>(e) A containment building must have a primary barrier designed to withstand the movement of personnel, waste, and handling equipment in the unit during the operating life of the unit and appropriate for the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste to be managed.</P>
              <P>(f) If appropriate to the nature of the waste management operation to take place in the unit, an exception to the structural strength requirement may be made for light-weight doors and windows that meet these criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) They provide an effective barrier against fugitive dust emissions under § 267.1102(d).</P>
              <P>(2) The unit is designed and operated in a fashion that assures that wastes will not actually come in contact with these openings.</P>
              <P>(g) You must inspect and record in the facility's operating record, at least once every seven days, data gathered from monitoring equipment and leak detection equipment, as well as the containment building and the area immediately surrounding the containment building to detect signs of releases of hazardous waste.</P>
              <P>(h) You must obtain certification by a qualified registered professional engineer that the containment building design meets the requirements of §§ 267.1102, 267.1103, and paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>If your containment building will be used to manage hazardous wastes containing free liquids or treated with free liquids, as determined by the paint filter test, by a visual examination, or by other appropriate means, you must include:</P>
              <P>(a) A primary barrier designed and constructed of materials to prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier (for example, a geomembrane covered by a concrete wear surface).</P>
              <P>(b) A liquid collection and removal system to minimize the accumulation of liquid on the primary barrier of the containment building.</P>
              <P>(1) The primary barrier must be sloped to drain liquids to the associated collection system; and</P>
              <P>(2) You must collect and remove liquids and waste to minimize hydraulic head on the containment system at the earliest practicable time.</P>
              <P>(c) A secondary containment system, including a secondary barrier designed and constructed to prevent migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier, and a leak detection system capable of detecting failure of the primary barrier and collecting accumulated hazardous wastes and liquids at the earliest practical time.</P>
              <P>(1) You may meet the requirements of the leak detection component of the secondary containment system by installing a system that is, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(i) Constructed with a bottom slope of 1 percent or more; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Constructed of a granular drainage material with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 × 10<E T="51">−2</E> cm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches (30.5 cm) or more, or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials with a transmissivity of 3 × 10-5 m<SU>2</SU>sec or more.</P>
              <P>(2) If you will be conducting treatment in the building, you must design the area in which the treatment will be conducted to prevent the release of liquids, wet materials, or liquid aerosols to other portions of the building.</P>
              <P>(3) You must construct the secondary containment system using materials that are chemically resistant to the waste and liquids managed in the containment building and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressure exerted by overlaying materials and by any equipment used in the containment building.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no generator, transporter, handler, or owner or operator of a treatment, storage, or disposal facility shall in any way dilute a restricted waste or the residual from treatment of a restricted waste as a substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with subpart D of this part, to circumvent the effective date of a prohibition in subpart C of this part, to otherwise avoid a prohibition in subpart C of this part, or to circumvent a land disposal prohibition imposed by RCRA section 3004.</P>

              <P>(b) Dilution of wastes that are hazardous only because they exhibit a characteristic in treatment systems which include land- based units which <PRTPAGE P="175"/>treat wastes subsequently discharged to a water of the United States pursuant to a permit issued under section 402 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), or which treat wastes in a CWA-equivalent treatment system, or which treat wastes for the purposes of pretreatment requirements under section 307 of the CWA is not impermissible dilution for purposes of this section unless a method other than DEACT has been specified in § 268.40 as the treatment standard, or unless the waste is a D003 reactive cyanide wastewater or nonwastewater.</P>
              <P>(c) Combustion of the hazardous waste codes listed in Appendix XI of this part is prohibited, unless the waste, at the point of generation, or after any bona fide treatment such as cyanide destruction prior to combustion, can be demonstrated to comply with one or more of the following criteria (unless otherwise specifically prohibited from combustion):</P>
              <P>(1) The waste contains hazardous organic constituents or cyanide at levels exceeding the constituent-specific treatment standard found in § 268.48;</P>
              <P>(2) The waste consists of organic, debris-like materials (e.g., wood, paper, plastic, or cloth) contaminated with an inorganic metal-bearing hazardous waste;</P>
              <P>(3) The waste, at point of generation, has reasonable heating value such as greater than or equal to 5000 BTU per pound;</P>
              <P>(4) The waste is co-generated with wastes for which combustion is a required method of treatment;</P>

              <P>(a) Wastes which are otherwise prohibited from land disposal under this part may be treated in a surface impoundment or series of impoundments provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) Treatment of such wastes occurs in the impoundments;</P>
              <P>(2) The following conditions are met:</P>

The sampling method, specified in the waste analysis plan under § 264.13 or § 265.13, must be designed such that representative samples of the sludge and the supernatant are tested separately rather than mixed to form homogeneous samples.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Removal.</E> The following treatment residues (including any liquid waste) must be removed at least annually; residues which do not meet the treatment standards promulgated under subpart D of this part; residues which do not meet the prohibition levels established under subpart C of this part or imposed by statute (where no treatment standards have been established); residues which are from the treatment of wastes prohibited from land disposal under subpart C of this part (where no treatment standards have been established and no prohibition levels apply); or residues from managing listed wastes which are not delisted under § 260.22 of this chapter. If the volume of liquid flowing through the impoundment or series of impoundments annually is greater than the volume of the impoundment or impoundments, this flow-through constitutes removal of <PRTPAGE P="176"/>the supernatant for the purpose of this requirement.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Subsequent management.</E> Treatment residues may not be placed in any other surface impoundment for subsequent management.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> Sampling and testing and recordkeeping provisions of §§ 264.13 and 265.13 of this chapter apply.</P>
              <P>(3) The impoundment meets the design requirements of § 264.221(c) or § 265.221(a) of this chapter, regardless that the unit may not be new, expanded, or a replacement, and be in compliance with applicable ground water monitoring requirements of subpart F of part 264 or part 265 of this chapter unless:</P>
              <P>(i) Exempted pursuant to § 264.221 (d) or (e) of this chapter, or to § 265.221 (c) or (d) of this chapter; or,</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon application by the owner or operator, the Administrator, after notice and an opportunity to comment, has granted a waiver of the requirements on the basis that the surface impoundment:</P>
              <P>(A) Has at least one liner, for which there is no evidence that such liner is leaking;</P>
              <P>(B) Is located more than one-quarter mile from an underground source of drinking water; and</P>
              <P>(C) Is in compliance with generally applicable ground water monitoring requirements for facilities with permits; or,</P>
              <P>(iii) Upon application by the owner or operator, the Administrator, after notice and an opportunity to comment, has granted a modification to the requirements on the basis of a demonstration that the surface impoundment is located, designed, and operated so as to assure that there will be no migration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water at any future time.</P>

              <P>(4) The owner or operator submits to the Regional Administrator a written certification that the requirements of § 268.4(a)(3) have been met. The following certification is required:

              <P>(a) Any person who generates, treats, stores, or disposes of a hazardous waste may submit an application to the Administrator for an extension to the effective date of any applicable restriction established under subpart C of this part. The applicant must demonstrate the following:</P>
              <P>(1) He has made a good-faith effort to locate and contract with treatment, recovery, or disposal facilities nationwide to manage his waste in accordance with the effective date of the applicable restriction established under subpart C of this part;</P>
              <P>(2) He has entered into a binding contractual commitment to construct or otherwise provide alternative treatment, recovery (e.g., recycling), or disposal capacity that meets the treatment standards specified in subpart D or, where treatment standards have not been specified, such treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity is protective of human health and the environment.</P>
              <P>(3) Due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, such alternative capacity cannot reasonably be made available by the applicable effective date. This demonstration may include a showing that the technical and practical difficulties associated with providing the alternative capacity will result in the capacity not being available by the applicable effective date;</P>
              <P>(4) The capacity being constructed or otherwise provided by the applicant will be sufficient to manage the entire quantity of waste that is the subject of the application;</P>

              <P>(5) He provides a detailed schedule for obtaining required operating and construction permits or an outline of <PRTPAGE P="177"/>how and when alternative capacity will be available;</P>
              <P>(6) He has arranged for adequate capacity to manage his waste during an extension and has documented in the application the location of all sites at which the waste will be managed; and</P>
              <P>(7) Any waste managed in a surface impoundment or landfill during the extension period will meet the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) An authorized representative signing an application described under paragraph (a) of this section shall make the following certification:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this document and all attachments and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(c) After receiving an application for an extension, the Administrator may request any additional information which he deems as necessary to evaluate the application.</P>
              <P>(d) An extension will apply only to the waste generated at the individual facility covered by the application and will not apply to restricted waste from any other facility.</P>

              <P>(e) On the basis of the information referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, after notice and opportunity for comment, and after consultation with appropriate State agencies in all affected States, the Administrator may grant an extension of up to 1 year from the effective date. The Administrator may renew this extension for up to 1 additional year upon the request of the applicant if the demonstration required in paragraph (a) of this section can still be made. In no event will an extension extend beyond 24 months from the applicable effective date specified in subpart C of part 268. The length of any extension authorized will be determined by the Administrator based on the time required to construct or obtain the type of capacity needed by the applicant as described in the completion schedule discussed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The Administrator will give public notice of the intent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public comment. The final decision on a petition will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(f) Any person granted an extension under this section must immediately notify the Administrator as soon as he has knowledge of any change in the conditions certified to in the application.</P>
              <P>(g) Any person granted an extension under this section shall submit written progress reports at intervals designated by the Administrator. Such reports must describe the overall progress made toward constructing or otherwise providing alternative treatment, recovery or disposal capacity; must identify any event which may cause or has caused a delay in the development of the capacity; and must summarize the steps taken to mitigate the delay. The Administrator can revoke the extension at any time if the applicant does not demonstrate a good-faith effort to meet the schedule for completion, if the Agency denies or revokes any required permit, if conditions certified in the application change, or for any violation of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(h) Whenever the Administrator establishes an extension to an effective date under this section, during the period for which such extension is in effect:</P>
              <P>(1) The storage restrictions under § 268.50(a) do not apply; and</P>
              <P>(2) Such hazardous waste may be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment only if such unit is in compliance with the technical requirements of the following provisions regardless of whether such unit is existing, new, or a replacement or lateral expansion.</P>
              <P>(i) The landfill, if in interim status, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 and § 265.301 (a), (c), and (d) of this chapter; or,</P>
              <P>(ii) The landfill, if permitted, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 264 and § 264.301 (c), (d) and (e) of this chapter; or</P>

              <P>(iii) The surface impoundment, if in interim status, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part <PRTPAGE P="178"/>265, § 265.221 (a), (c), and (d) of this chapter, and RCRA section 3005(j)(1); or</P>
              <P>(iv) The surface impoundment, if permitted, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 264 and § 264.221 (c), (d) and (e) of this chapter; or</P>
              <P>(v) The surface impoundment, if newly subject to RCRA section 3005(j)(1) due to the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics for the identification of hazardous waste, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 of this chapter within 12 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, and with the requirements of § 265.221 (a), (c) and (d) of this chapter within 48 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste. If a national capacity variance is granted, during the period the variance is in effect, the surface impoundment, if newly subject to RCRA section 3005(j)(1) due to the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, is in compliance with the requirements of subpart F of part 265 of this chapter within 12 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste, and with the requirements of § 265.221 (a), (c) and (d) of this chapter within 48 months after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste; or</P>

              <P>(4) A quality assurance and quality control plan that addresses all aspects of the demonstration must be approved by the Administrator; and,</P>

              <P>(5) An analysis must be performed to identify and quantify any aspects of the demonstration that contribute significantly to uncertainty. This analysis must include an evaluation of the consequences of predictable future events, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, floods, severe storm <PRTPAGE P="179"/>events, droughts, or other natural phenomena.</P>
              <P>(c) Each petition referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A monitoring plan that describes the monitoring program installed at and/or around the unit to verify continued compliance with the conditions of the variance. This monitoring plan must provide information on the monitoring of the unit and/or the environment around the unit. The following specific information must be included in the plan:</P>
              <P>(i) The media monitored in the cases where monitoring of the environment around the unit is required;</P>
              <P>(ii) The type of monitoring conducted at the unit, in the cases where monitoring of the unit is required;</P>
              <P>(iii) The location of the monitoring stations;</P>
              <P>(iv) The monitoring interval (frequency of monitoring at each station);</P>
              <P>(v) The specific hazardous constituents to be monitored;</P>

              <P>(ix) The data recording/reporting procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) Where applicable, the monitoring program described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be in place for a period of time specified by the Administrator, as part of his approval of the petition, prior to receipt of prohibited waste at the unit.</P>
              <P>(3) The monitoring data collected according to the monitoring plan specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be sent to the Administrator according to a format and schedule specified and approved in the monitoring plan, and</P>
              <P>(4) A copy of the monitoring data collected under the monitoring plan specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be kept on-site at the facility in the operating record.</P>
              <P>(5) The monitoring program specified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) All sampling, testing, and analytical data must be approved by the Administrator and must provide data that is accurate and reproducible.</P>

              <P>(d) Each petition must be submitted to the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(e) After a petition has been approved, the owner or operator must report any changes in conditions at the unit and/or the environment around the unit that significantly depart from the conditions described in the variance and affect the potential for migration of hazardous constituents from the units as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If the owner or operator plans to make changes to the unit design, construction, or operation, such a change must be proposed, in writing, and the owner or operator must submit a demonstration to the Administrator at least 30 days prior to making the change. The Administrator will determine whether the proposed change invalidates the terms of the petition and will determine the appropriate response. Any change must be approved by the Administrator prior to being made.</P>
              <P>(2) If the owner or operator discovers that a condition at the site which was modeled or predicted in the petition does not occur as predicted, this change must be reported, in writing, to the Administrator within 10 days of discovering the change. The Administrator will determine whether the reported change from the terms of the petition requires further action, which may include termination of waste acceptance and revocation of the petition, petition modifications, or other responses.</P>
              <P>(f) If the owner or operator determines that there is migration of hazardous constituent(s) from the unit, the owner or operator must:</P>
              <P>(1) Immediately suspend receipt of prohibited waste at the unit, and</P>

              <P>(2) Notify the Administrator, in writing, within 10 days of the determination that a release has occurred.<PRTPAGE P="180"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Following receipt of the notification the Administrator will determine, within 60 days of receiving notification, whether the owner or operator can continue to receive prohibited waste in the unit and whether the variance is to be revoked. The Administrator shall also determine whether further examination of any migration is warranted under applicable provisions of part 264 or part 265.</P>

              <P>(g) Each petition must include the following statement signed by the petitioner or an authorized representative:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <FP>I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this petition and all attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that submitted information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(h) After receiving a petition, the Administrator may request any additional information that reasonably may be required to evaluate the demonstration.</P>
              <P>(i) If approved, the petition will apply to land disposal of the specific restricted waste at the individual disposal unit described in the demonstration and will not apply to any other restricted waste at that disposal unit, or to that specific restricted waste at any other disposal unit.</P>
              <P>(j) The Administrator will give public notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the intent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public comment. The final decision on a petition will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(k) The term of a petition granted under this section shall be no longer than the term of the RCRA permit if the disposal unit is operating under a RCRA permit, or up to a maximum of 10 years from the date of approval provided under paragraph (g) of this section if the unit is operating under interim status. In either case, the term of the granted petition shall expire upon the termination or denial of a RCRA permit, or upon the termination of interim status or when the volume limit of waste to be land disposed during the term of petition is reached.</P>
              <P>(l) Prior to the Administrator's decision, the applicant is required to comply with all restrictions on land disposal under this part once the effective date for the waste has been reached.</P>
              <P>(m) The petition granted by the Administrator does not relieve the petitioner of his responsibilities in the management of hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 260 through part 271.</P>
              <P>(n) Liquid hazardous wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls at concentrations greater than or equal to 500 ppm are not eligible for an exemption under this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Testing, tracking, and recordkeeping requirements for generators, treaters, and disposal facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for generators:</E> (1) A generator of hazardous waste must determine if the waste has to be treated before it can be land disposed. This is done by determining if the hazardous waste meets the treatment standards in § 268.40, 268.45, or § 268.49. This determination can be made concurrently with the hazardous waste determination required in § 262.11 of this chapter, in either of two ways: testing the waste or using knowledge of the waste. If the generator tests the waste, testing would normally determine the total concentration of hazardous constituents, or the concentration of hazardous constituents in an extract of the waste obtained using test method 1311 in “Test Methods of Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846, (incorporated by reference, see § 260.11 of this chapter), depending on whether the treatment standard for the waste is expressed as a total concentration or concentration of hazardous constituent in the waste's extract. (Alternatively, the generator must send the waste to a RCRA-permitted hazardous waste treatment facility, where the waste treatment facility must comply with the requirements of § 264.13 of this <PRTPAGE P="181"/>chapter and paragraph (b) of this section.) In addition, some hazardous wastes must be treated by particular treatment methods before they can be land disposed and some soils are contaminated by such hazardous wastes. These treatment standards are also found in § 268.40, and are described in detail in § 268.42, Table 1. These wastes, and soils contaminated with such wastes, do not need to be tested (however, if they are in a waste mixture, other wastes with concentration level treatment standards would have to be tested). If a generator determines they are managing a waste or soil contaminated with a waste, that displays a hazardous characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity, they must comply with the special requirements of § 268.9 of this part in addition to any applicable requirements in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the waste or contaminated soil does not meet the treatment standards, or if the generator chooses not to make the determination of whether his waste must be treated, with the initial shipment of waste to each treatment or storage facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each treatment or storage facility receiving the waste, and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information in column “268.7(a)(2)” of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. (Alternatively, if the generator chooses not to make the determination of whether the waste must be treated, the notification must include the EPA Hazardous Waste Numbers and Manifest Number of the first shipment and must state “This hazardous waste may or may not be subject to the LDR treatment standards. The treatment facility must make the determination.”) No further notification is necessary until such time that the waste or facility change, in which case a new notification must be sent and a copy placed in the generator's file.</P>
              <P>(3) If the waste or contaminated soil meets the treatment standard at the original point of generation:</P>

              <P>(i) With the initial shipment of waste to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility receiving the waste, and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information indicated in column “268.7(a)(3)” of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in § 268.7(a)(4) and the following certification statement, signed by an authorized representative:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through knowledge of the waste to support this certification that the waste complies with the treatment standards specified in 40 CFR part 268 subpart D. I believe that the information I submitted is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of a fine and imprisonment.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(ii) For contaminated soil, with the initial shipment of wastes to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each facility receiving the waste and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information in column “268.7(a)(3)” of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in § 268.7(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(iii) If the waste changes, the generator must send a new notice and certification to the receiving facility, and place a copy in their files. Generators of hazardous debris excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under § 261.3(f) of this chapter are not subject to these requirements.</P>

              <P>(4) For reporting, tracking, and recordkeeping when exceptions allow certain wastes or contaminated soil that do not meet the treatment standards to be land disposed: There are certain exemptions from the requirement that hazardous wastes or contaminated soil meet treatment standards before they can be land disposed. These include, but are not limited to case-by-case extensions under § 268.5, disposal in a no-migration unit under § 268.6, or a national capacity variance or case-by-case capacity variance under subpart C of this part. If a generator's waste is so exempt, then with the initial shipment of waste, the generator must send a one-time written notice to each land disposal facility receiving the waste. The notice must include the information indicated in column “268.7(a)(4)” <PRTPAGE P="182"/>of the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table below. If the waste changes, the generator must send a new notice to the receiving facility, and place a copy in their files.</P>

              <P>(5) If a generator is managing and treating prohibited waste or contaminated soil in tanks, containers, or containment buildings regulated under 40 CFR 262.15, 262.16, and 262.17 to meet applicable LDR treatment standards found at § 268.40, the generator must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan which describes the procedures they will carry out to comply with the treatment standards. (Generators treating hazardous debris under the alternative treatment standards of Table 1 to § 268.45, however, are not subject to these waste analysis requirements.) The plan must be kept on site in the generator's records, and the following requirements must be met:</P>
              <P>(i) The waste analysis plan must be based on a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of the prohibited waste(s) being treated, and contain all information necessary to treat the waste(s) in accordance with the requirements of this part, including the selected testing frequency.</P>
              <P>(ii) Such plan must be kept in the facility's on-site files and made available to inspectors.</P>
              <P>(iii) Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this paragraph must comply with the notification requirements of § 268.7(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(6) If a generator determines that the waste or contaminated soil is restricted based solely on his knowledge of the waste, all supporting data used to make this determination must be retained on-site in the generator's files. If a generator determines that the waste is restricted based on testing this waste or an extract developed using the test method 1311 in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846, as referenced in § 260.11 of this chapter, and all waste analysis data must be retained on-site in the generator's files.</P>

              <P>(7) If a generator determines that he is managing a prohibited waste that is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or is exempted from Subtitle C regulation under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6 subsequent to <PRTPAGE P="183"/>the point of generation (including deactivated characteristic hazardous wastes managed in wastewater treatment systems subject to the Clean Water Act (CWA) as specified at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(2) or that are CWA-equivalent, or are managed in an underground injection well regulated by the SDWA), he must place a one-time notice describing such generation, subsequent exclusion from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or exemption from RCRA Subtitle C regulation, and the disposition of the waste, in the facility's on-site files.</P>
              <P>(8) Generators must retain on-site a copy of all notices, certifications, waste analysis data, and other documentation produced pursuant to this section for at least three years from the date that the waste that is the subject of such documentation was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal. The three year record retention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator. The requirements of this paragraph apply to solid wastes even when the hazardous characteristic is removed prior to disposal, or when the waste is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6, or exempted from Subtitle C regulation, subsequent to the point of generation.</P>
              <P>(9) If a generator is managing a lab pack containing hazardous wastes and wishes to use the alternative treatment standard for lab packs found at § 268.42(c):</P>

              <P>(i) With the initial shipment of waste to a treatment facility, the generator must submit a notice that provides the information in column “§ 268.7(a)(9)” in the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and the following certification. The certification, which must be signed by an authorized representative and must be placed in the generator's files, must say the following:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste and that the lab pack contains only wastes that have not been excluded under appendix IV to 40 CFR part 268 and that this lab pack will be sent to a combustion facility in compliance with the alternative treatment standards for lab packs at 40 CFR 268.42(c). I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(ii) No further notification is necessary until such time that the wastes in the lab pack change, or the receiving facility changes, in which case a new notice and certification must be sent and a copy placed in the generator's file.</P>

Based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining this information, I believe that the nonwastewater organic constituents have been treated by combustion units as specified in 268.42, Table 1. I have been unable to detect the nonwastewater organic constituents, despite having used best good-faith efforts to analyze for such constituents. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.</P>

                <P>I certify under penalty of law that the waste has been treated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.40 or 268.49 to remove the hazardous characteristic. This decharacterized waste contains underlying hazardous constituents that require further treatment to meet treatment standards. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(v) For characteristic wastes that contain underlying hazardous constituents as defined § 268.2(i) that are treated on-site to remove the hazardous characteristic to treat underlying hazardous constituents to levels in § 268.48 Universal Treatment Standards, the certification must state the following:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>I certify under penalty of law that the waste has been treated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 268.40 to remove the hazardous characteristic and that underlying hazardous constituents, as defined in § 268.2(i) have been treated on-site to meet the § 268.48 Universal Treatment Standards. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(5) If the waste or treatment residue will be further managed at a different treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the treatment, storage, or disposal facility sending the waste or treatment residue off-site must comply with the notice and certification requirements applicable to generators under this section.</P>

              <P>(6) Where the wastes are recyclable materials used in a manner constituting disposal subject to the provisions of § 266.20(b) of this chapter regarding treatment standards and prohibition levels, the owner or operator of a treatment facility (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the recycler) must, for the initial shipment of waste, prepare a one-time certification described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and a one-time notice which includes the information in paragraph (b)(3) of this section (except the manifest number). The certification and notification must be placed in the facility's on-site files. If the waste or the receiving facility changes, a new certification and notification must be prepared and placed in the on site files. In addition, the recycling facility must also keep records of the name and location of each entity receiving the hazardous waste-derived product.</P>
              <P>(c) Except where the owner or operator is disposing of any waste that is a recyclable material used in a manner constituting disposal pursuant to 40 CFR 266.20(b), the owner or operator of any land disposal facility disposing any waste subject to restrictions under this part must:</P>
              <P>(1) Have copies of the notice and certifications specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Test the waste, or an extract of the waste or treatment residue developed using test method 1311 (the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, described in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846 as incorporated by reference in § 260.11 of this chapter), to assure that the wastes or treatment residues are in compliance with the applicable treatment standards set forth in subpart D of this part. Such testing must be performed according to the frequency specified in the facility's waste analysis plan as required by § 264.13 or § 265.13 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Special rules regarding wastes that exhibit a characteristic.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The initial generator of a solid waste must determine each EPA Hazardous Waste Number (waste code) applicable to the waste in order to determine the applicable treatment standards under subpart D of this part. This determination may be made concurrently with the hazardous waste determination required in § 262.11 of this chapter. For purposes of part 268, the <PRTPAGE P="187"/>waste will carry the waste code for any applicable listed waste (40 CFR part 261, subpart D). In addition, where the waste exhibits a characteristic, the waste will carry one or more of the characteristic waste codes (40 CFR part 261, subpart C), except when the treatment standard for the listed waste operates in lieu of the treatment standard for the characteristic waste, as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. If the generator determines that their waste displays a hazardous characteristic (and is not D001 nonwastewaters treated by CMBST, RORGS, OR POLYM of § 268.42, Table 1), the generator must determine the underlying hazardous constituents (as defined at § 268.2(i)) in the characteristic waste.</P>
              <P>(b) Where a prohibited waste is both listed under 40 CFR part 261, subpart D and exhibits a characteristic under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, the treatment standard for the waste code listed in 40 CFR part 261, subpart D will operate in lieu of the standard for the waste code under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, provided that the treatment standard for the listed waste includes a treatment standard for the constituent that causes the waste to exhibit the characteristic. Otherwise, the waste must meet the treatment standards for all applicable listed and characteristic waste codes.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to any applicable standards determined from the initial point of generation, no prohibited waste which exhibits a characteristic under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C may be land disposed unless the waste complies with the treatment standards under subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) Wastes that exhibit a characteristic are also subject to § 268.7 requirements, except that once the waste is no longer hazardous, a one-time notification and certification must be placed in the generator's or treater's on-site files. The notification and certification must be updated if the process or operation generating the waste changes and/or if the subtitle D facility receiving the waste changes.</P>
              <P>(1) The notification must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) Name and address of the RCRA Subtitle D facility receiving the waste shipment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of the waste as initially generated, including the applicable EPA hazardous waste code(s), treatability group(s), and underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in § 268.2(i)), unless the waste will be treated and monitored for all underlying hazardous constituents. If all underlying hazardous constituents will be treated and monitored, there is no requirement to list any of the underlying hazardous constituents on the notice.</P>
              <P>(2) The certification must be signed by an authorized representative and must state the language found in § 268.7(b)(4).</P>
              <P>(i) If treatment removes the characteristic but does not meet standards applicable to underlying hazardous constituents, then the certification found in § 268.7(b)(4)(iv) applies.</P>

This prohibition does not apply to unexploded ordnance and other explosive devices which have been the subject of an emergency response. (Such D003 wastes are prohibited unless they meet the treatment standard of DEACT before land disposal (see § 268.40)).</P>
              <P>(c) On September 21, 1998, the wastes specified in 40 CFR 261.32 as EPA Hazardous Waste number K088 are prohibited from land disposal. In addition, soil and debris contaminated with these wastes are prohibited from land disposal.</P>

              <P>(d) On April 8, 1998, radioactive wastes mixed with K088, K156-K159, K161, P127, P128, P185, P188-P192, P194, <PRTPAGE P="194"/>P196-P199, P201-P205, U271, U278-U280, U364, U367, U372, U373, U387, U389, U394, U395, U404, and U409-U411 are prohibited from land disposal. In addition, soil and debris contaminated with these radioactive mixed wastes are prohibited from land disposal.</P>
              <P>(e) Between July 8, 1996, and April 8, 1998, the wastes included in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section may be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment, only if such unit is in compliance with the requirements specified in § 268.5(h)(2).</P>
              <P>(f) The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section do not apply if:</P>
              <P>(1) The wastes meet the applicable treatment standards specified in Subpart D of this part;</P>
              <P>(2) Persons have been granted an exemption from a prohibition pursuant to a petition under § 268.6, with respect to those wastes and units covered by the petition;</P>
              <P>(3) The wastes meet the applicable alternate treatment standards established pursuant to a petition granted under § 268.44;</P>
              <P>(4) Persons have been granted an extension to the effective date of a prohibition pursuant to § 268.5, with respect to these wastes covered by the extension.</P>
              <P>(g) To determine whether a hazardous waste identified in this section exceeds the applicable treatment standards specified in § 268.40, the initial generator must test a sample of the waste extract or the entire waste, depending on whether the treatment standards are expressed as concentrations in the waste extract or the waste, or the generator may use knowledge of the waste. If the waste contains constituents in excess of the applicable Subpart D levels, the waste is prohibited from land disposal, and all requirements of this part 268 are applicable, except as otherwise specified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability of treatment standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A prohibited waste identified in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” may be land disposed only if it meets the requirements found in the table. For each waste, the table identifies one of three types of treatment standard requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) All hazardous constituents in the waste or in the treatment residue must be at or below the values found in the table for that waste (“total waste standards”); or</P>
              <P>(2) The hazardous constituents in the extract of the waste or in the extract of the treatment residue must be at or below the values found in the table (“waste extract standards”); or</P>
              <P>(3) The waste must be treated using the technology specified in the table (“technology standard”), which are described in detail in § 268.42, Table 1—Technology Codes and Description of Technology-Based Standards.</P>
              <P>(b) For wastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on maximums for any one day, except for D004 through D011 wastes for which the previously promulgated treatment standards based on grab samples remain in effect. For all nonwastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on grab sampling. For wastes covered by the waste extract standards, the test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11, must be used to measure compliance. An exception is made for D004 and D008, for which either of two test methods may be used: Method 1311, or Method 1310B, the Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test. For wastes covered by a technology standard, the wastes may be land disposed after being treated using that specified technology or an equivalent treatment technology approved by the Administrator under the procedures set forth in § 268.42(b).</P>

              <P>(c) When wastes with differing treatment standards for a constituent of concern are combined for purposes of treatment, the treatment residue must <PRTPAGE P="195"/>meet the lowest treatment standard for the constituent of concern.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding the prohibitions specified in paragraph (a) of this section, treatment and disposal facilities may demonstrate (and certify pursuant to 40 CFR 268.7(b)(5)) compliance with the treatment standards for organic constituents specified by a footnote in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, provided the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
              <P>(1) The treatment standards for the organic constituents were established based on incineration in units operated in accordance with the technical requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or based on combustion in fuel substitution units operating in accordance with applicable technical requirements;</P>
              <P>(2) The treatment or disposal facility has used the methods referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to treat the organic constituents; and</P>
              <P>(3) The treatment or disposal facility may demonstrate compliance with organic constituents if good-faith analytical efforts achieve detection limits for the regulated organic constituents that do not exceed the treatment standards specified in this section by an order of magnitude.</P>
              <P>(e) For characteristic wastes (D001-D043) that are subject to treatment standards in the following table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes,” and are not managed in a wastewater treatment system that is regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), that is CWA-equivalent, or that is injected into a Class I nonhazardous deep injection well, all underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in § 268.2(i)) must meet Universal Treatment Standards, found in § 268.48, Table Universal Treatment Standards, prior to land disposal as defined in § 268.2(c) of this part.</P>
              <P>(f) The treatment standards for F001-F005 nonwastewater constituents carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol apply to wastes which contain only one, two, or three of these constituents. Compliance is measured for these constituents in the waste extract from test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods”, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11. If the waste contains any of these three constituents along with any of the other 25 constituents found in F001-F005, then compliance with treatment standards for carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol are not required.</P>
              <P>(g) Between August 26, 1996 and March 4, 1999 the treatment standards for the wastes specified in 40 CFR 261.32 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers K156-K161; and in 40 CFR 261.33 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers P127, P128, P185, P188-P192, P194, P196-P199, P201-P205, U271, U277-U280, U364-U367, U372, U373, U375-U379, U381-U387, U389-U396, U400-U404, U407, and U409-U411; and soil contaminated with these wastes; may be satisfied by either meeting the constituent concentrations presented in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, or by treating the waste by the following technologies: combustion, as defined by the technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1, for nonwastewaters; and, biodegradation as defined by the technology code BIODG, carbon adsorption as defined by the technology code CARBN, chemical oxidation as defined by the technology code CHOXD, or combustion as defined as technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1, for wastewaters.</P>
              <P>(h) Prohibited D004-D011 mixed radioactive wastes and mixed radioactive listed wastes containing metal constituents, that were previously treated by stabilization to the treatment standards in effect at that time and then put into storage, do not have to be re-treated to meet treatment standards in this section prior to land disposal.</P>
              <P>(i) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(j) Effective September 4, 1998, the treatment standards for the wastes specified in 40 CFR 261.33 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers P185, P191, P192, P197, U364, U394, and U395 may be satisfied by either meeting the constituent concentrations presented in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, or by treating the waste by the following technologies: combustion, as defined by the <PRTPAGE P="196"/>technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1 of this Part, for nonwastewaters; and, biodegradation as defined by the technology code BIODG, carbon adsorption as defined by the technology code CARBN, chemical oxidation as defined by the technology code CHOXD, or combustion as defined as technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1 of this Part, for wastewaters.<PRTPAGE P="197"/>

Where there is no specific treatment standard for radioactive mixed waste, the treatment standard for the hazardous waste (as designated by EPA waste code) applies. Hazardous debris containing radioactive waste is subject to the treatment standards specified in § 268.45.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Variance from a treatment standard.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Based on a petition filed by a generator or treater of hazardous waste, the Administrator may approve a variance from an applicable treatment standard if:<PRTPAGE P="269"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) It is not physically possible to treat the waste to the level specified in the treatment standard, or by the method specified as the treatment standard. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must demonstrate that because the physical or chemical properties of the waste differ significantly from waste analyzed in developing the treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to the specified level or by the specified method; or</P>
              <P>(2) It is inappropriate to require the waste to be treated to the level specified in the treatment standard or by the method specified as the treatment standard, even though such treatment is technically possible. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must either demonstrate that:</P>
              <P>(i) Treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is technically inappropriate (for example, resulting in combustion of large amounts of mildly contaminated environmental media); or</P>
              <P>(ii) For remediation waste only, treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is environmentally inappropriate because it would likely discourage aggressive remediation.</P>
              <P>(b) Each petition must be submitted in accordance with the procedures in § 260.20.</P>

              <P>(c) Each petition must include the following statement signed by the petitioner or an authorized representative:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted in this petition and all attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(d) After receiving a petition for variance from a treatment standard, the Administrator may request any additional information or samples which he may require to evaluate the petition. Additional copies of the complete petition may be requested as needed to send to affected states and Regional Offices.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator will give public notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of the intent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public comment. The final decision on a variance from a treatment standard will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(f) A generator, treatment facility, or disposal facility that is managing a waste covered by a variance from the treatment standards must comply with the waste analysis requirements for restricted wastes found under § 268.7.</P>
              <P>(g) During the petition review process, the applicant is required to comply with all restrictions on land disposal under this part once the effective date for the waste has been reached.</P>
              <P>(h) Based on a petition filed by a generator or treater of hazardous waste, the Administrator or his or her delegated representative may approve a site-specific variance from an applicable treatment standard if:</P>
              <P>(1) It is not physically possible to treat the waste to the level specified in the treatment standard, or by the method specified as the treatment standard. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must demonstrate that because the physical or chemical properties of the waste differ significantly from waste analyzed in developing the treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to the specified level or by the specified method; or</P>
              <P>(2) It is inappropriate to require the waste to be treated to the level specified in the treatment standard or by the method specified as the treatment standard, even though such treatment is technically possible. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must either demonstrate that:</P>
              <P>(i) Treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is technically inappropriate (for example, resulting in combustion of large amounts of mildly contaminated environmental media where the treatment standard is not based on combustion of such media); or</P>

              <P>(ii) For remediation waste only, treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is environmentally inappropriate because it would likely discourage aggressive remediation.<PRTPAGE P="270"/>
              </P>

              <P>(3) For contaminated soil only, treatment to the level or by the method specified in the soil treatment standards would result in concentrations of hazardous constituents that are below (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, lower than) the concentrations necessary to minimize short- and long-term threats to human health and the environment. Treatment variances approved under this paragraph must:</P>
              <P>(i) At a minimum, impose alternative land disposal restriction treatment standards that, using a reasonable maximum exposure scenario:</P>

              <P>(A) For carcinogens, achieve constituent concentrations that result in the total excess risk to an individual exposed over a lifetime generally falling within a range from 10 <E T="51">−4</E> to 10 <E T="51">−6</E>; and</P>
              <P>(B) For constituents with non-carcinogenic effects, achieve constituent concentrations that an individual could be exposed to on a daily basis without appreciable risk of deleterious effect during a lifetime.</P>
              <P>(ii) Not consider post-land-disposal controls.</P>

              <P>(4) For contaminated soil only, treatment to the level or by the method specified in the soil treatment standards would result in concentrations of hazardous constituents that are below (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, lower than) natural background concentrations at the site where the contaminated soil will land disposed.</P>
              <P>(5) Public notice and a reasonable opportunity for public comment must be provided before granting or denying a petition.</P>
              <P>(i) Each application for a site-specific variance from a treatment standard must include the information in § 260.20(b)(1)-(4);</P>
              <P>(j) After receiving an application for a site-specific variance from a treatment standard, the Assistant Administrator, or his delegated representative, may request any additional information or samples which may be required to evaluate the application.</P>
              <P>(k) A generator, treatment facility, or disposal facility that is managing a waste covered by a site-specific variance from a treatment standard must comply with the waste analysis requirements for restricted wastes found under § 268.7.</P>
              <P>(l) During the application review process, the applicant for a site-specific variance must comply with all restrictions on land disposal under this part once the effective date for the waste has been reached.</P>
              <P>(m) For all variances, the petitioner must also demonstrate that compliance with any given treatment variance is sufficient to minimize threats to human health and the environment posed by land disposal of the waste. In evaluating this demonstration, EPA may take into account whether a treatment variance should be approved if the subject waste is to be used in a manner constituting disposal pursuant to 40 CFR 266.20 through 266.23.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Treatment standards.</E> Hazardous debris must be treated prior to land disposal as follows unless EPA determines under § 261.3(f)(2) of this chapter that the debris is no longer contaminated with hazardous waste or the debris is treated to the waste-specific treatment standard provided in this subpart for the waste contaminating the debris:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Hazardous debris must be treated for each “contaminant subject to treatment” defined by paragraph (b) of this section using the technology or technologies identified in Table 1 of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Characteristic debris.</E> Hazardous debris that exhibits the characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity identified under §§ 261.21, 261.22, and 261.23 of this chapter, respectively, must be deactivated by treatment using one of the technologies identified in Table 1 of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Mixtures of debris types.</E> The treatment standards of Table 1 in this section must be achieved for each type of debris contained in a mixture of debris types. If an immobilization technology is used in a treatment train, it must be the last treatment technology used.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Mixtures of contaminant types.</E> Debris that is contaminated with two or more contaminants subject to treatment identified under paragraph (b) of this section must be treated for each contaminant using one or more treatment technologies identified in Table 1 of this section. If an immobilization technology is used in a treatment train, it must be the last treatment technology used.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Waste PCBs.</E> Hazardous debris that is also a waste PCB under 40 CFR part 761 is subject to the requirements of either 40 CFR part 761 or the requirements of this section, whichever are more stringent.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contaminants subject to treatment.</E> Hazardous debris must be treated for each “contaminant subject to treatment.” The contaminants subject to treatment must be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Toxicity characteristic debris.</E> The contaminants subject to treatment for debris that exhibits the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) by § 261.24 of this chapter are those EP constituents for which the debris exhibits the TC toxicity characteristic.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Debris contaminated with listed waste.</E> The contaminants subject to treatment for debris that is contaminated with a prohibited listed hazardous waste are those constituents or wastes for which treatment standards are established for the waste under § 268.40.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Cyanide reactive debris.</E> Hazardous debris that is reactive because of cyanide must be treated for cyanide.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditioned exclusion of treated debris.</E> Hazardous debris that has been treated using one of the specified extraction or destruction technologies in Table 1 of this section and that does not exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste identified under subpart C, part 261, of this chapter after treatment is not a hazardous waste and need not be managed in a subtitle C facility. Hazardous debris contaminated with a listed waste that is treated by an immobilization technology specified in Table 1 is a hazardous waste and must be managed in a subtitle C facility.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Treatment residuals</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> Except as provided by paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(4) of this section:</P>

              <P>(i) Residue from the treatment of hazardous debris must be separated from the treated debris using simple physical or mechanical means; and<PRTPAGE P="273"/>
              </P>

              <SUBJECT>Prohibitions on storage of restricted wastes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except as provided in this section, the storage of hazardous wastes restricted from land disposal under subpart C of this part of RCRA section 3004 is prohibited, unless the following conditions are met:</P>

              <P>(1) A generator stores such wastes in tanks, containers, or containment buildings on-site solely for the purpose of the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal and the generator complies with the requirements in §§ 262.16 and 262.17 and parts 264 and 265 of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="286"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) An owner/operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility stores such wastes in tanks, containers, or containment buildings solely for the purpose of the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal and:</P>
              <P>(i) Each container is clearly marked to identify its contents and with:</P>
              <P>(A) The words “Hazardous Waste”;</P>
              <P>(B) The applicable EPA hazardous waste number(s) (EPA hazardous waste codes) in subparts C and D of part 261 of this chapter; or use a nationally recognized electronic system, such as bar coding, to identify the EPA hazardous waste number(s);</P>

              <P>(C) An indication of the hazards of the contents (examples include, but are not limited to, the applicable hazardous waste characteristic(s) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> ignitable, corrosive, reactive, toxic); hazard communication consistent with the Department of Transportation requirements at 49 CFR part 172 subpart E (labeling) or subpart F (placarding); a hazard statement or pictogram consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard Communication Standard at 29 CFR 1910.1200; or a chemical hazard label consistent with the National Fire Protection Association code 704); and</P>
              <P>(D) The date each period of accumulation begins.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each tank is clearly marked with a description of its contents, the quantity of each hazardous waste received, and the date each period of accumulation begins, or such information for each tank is recorded and maintained in the operating record at that facility. Regardless of whether the tank itself is marked, an owner/operator must comply with the operating record requirements specified in § 264.73 or § 265.73.</P>
              <P>(3) A transporter stores manifested shipments of such wastes at a transfer facility for 10 days or less.</P>
              <P>(b) An owner/operator of a treatment, storage or disposal facility may store such wastes for up to one year unless the Agency can demonstrate that such storage was not solely for the purpose of accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal.</P>
              <P>(c) An owner/operator of a treatment, storage or disposal facility may store such wastes beyond one year; however, the owner/operator bears the burden of proving that such storage was solely for the purpose of accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal.</P>
              <P>(d) If a generator's waste is exempt from a prohibition on the type of land disposal utilized for the waste (for example, because of an approved case-by-case extension under § 268.5, an approved § 268.6 petition, or a national capacity variance under subpart C), the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply during the period of such exemption.</P>
              <P>(e) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to hazardous wastes that meet the treatment standards specified under §§ 268.41, 268.42, and 268.43 or the treatment standards specified under the variance in § 268.44, or, where treatment standards have not been specified, is in compliance with the applicable prohibitions specified in § 268.32 or RCRA section 3004.</P>
              <P>(f) Liquid hazardous wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm must be stored at a facility that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 761.65(b) and must be removed from storage and treated or disposed as required by this part within one year of the date when such wastes are first placed into storage. The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to such PCB wastes prohibited under § 268.32 of this part.</P>
              <P>(g) The prohibition and requirements in this section do not apply to hazardous remediation wastes stored in a staging pile approved pursuant to § 264.554 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>The treatment standard for many characteristic wastes is stated in the § 268.40 Table of Treatment Standards as “Deactivation and meet UTS.” EPA has determined that many technologies, when used alone or in combination, can achieve the deactivation portion of the treatment standard. Characteristic wastes that are not managed in a facility regulated by the Clean Water Act (CWA) or in a CWA-equivalent facility, and that also contain underlying hazardous constituents (see § 268.2(i)) must be treated not only by a “deactivating” technology to remove the characteristic, but also to achieve the universal treatment standards (UTS) for underlying hazardous constituents. The following appendix presents a partial list of technologies, utilizing the five letter technology codes established in 40 CFR 268.42 Table 1, that may be useful in meeting the treatment standard. Use of these specific technologies is not mandatory and does not preclude direct reuse, recovery, and/or the use of other pretreatment technologies, provided deactivation is achieved and underlying hazardous constituents are treated to achieve the UTS.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Technical regulations.</E> The RCRA permit program has separate additional regulations that contain technical requirements. These separate regulations are used by permit issuing authorities to determine what requirements must be placed in permits if they are issued. These separate regulations are located in 40 CFR parts 264, 266, 267, and 268.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overview of the RCRA Permit Program.</E> Not later than 90 days after the promulgation or revision of regulations in 40 CFR part 261 (identifying and listing hazardous wastes) generators and transporters of hazardous waste, and owners or operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities may be required to file a notification of that activity under section 3010. Six months after the initial promulgation of the part 261 regulations, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste by any person who has not applied for or received a RCRA permit is prohibited. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDs) that are otherwise subject to permitting under RCRA and that meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(1), or paragraph (b)(2) of this section, may be eligible for a standardized permit under subpart J of this part. A RCRA permit application consists of two parts, part A (see § 270.13) and part B (see § 270.14 and applicable sections in §§ 270.15 through 270.29). For “existing HWM facilities,” the requirement to submit an application is satisfied by submitting only part A of the permit application until the date the Director sets for submitting part B of the application. (Part A consists of Forms 1 and 3 of the Consolidated Permit Application Forms.) Timely submission of both notification under section 3010 and part A qualifies owners and operators of existing HWM facilities (who are required to have a permit) for interim status under section 3005(e) of RCRA. Facility owners <PRTPAGE P="308"/>and operators with interim status are treated as having been issued a permit until EPA or a State with interim authorization for Phase II or final authorization under part 271 makes a final determination on the permit application. Facility owners and operators with interim status must comply with interim status standards set forth at 40 CFR part 265 and 266 or with the analogous provisions of a State program which has received interim or final authorization under part 271. Facility owners and operators with interim status are not relieved from complying with other State requirements. For existing HWM facilities, the Director shall set a date, giving at least six months notice, for submission of part B of the application. There is no form for part B of the application; rather, part B must be submitted in narrative form and contain the information set forth in the applicable sections of §§ 270.14 through 270.29. Owners or operators of new HWM facilities must submit parts A and B of the permit application at least 180 days before physical construction is expected to commence.</P>
              <P>(1) The facility generates hazardous waste and then non-thermally treats or stores hazardous waste on-site in tanks, containers, or containment buildings; or</P>
              <P>(2) The facility receives hazardous waste generated off-site by a generator under the same ownership as the receiving facility, and then stores or non-thermally treats the hazardous waste in containers, tanks, or containment buildings.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope of the RCRA permit requirement.</E> RCRA requires a permit for the “treatment,” “storage,” and “disposal” of any “hazardous waste” as identified or listed in 40 CFR part 261. The terms “treatment,” “storage,” “disposal,” and “hazardous waste” are defined in § 270.2. Owners and operators of hazardous waste management units must have permits during the active life (including the closure period) of the unit. Owners and operators of surface impoundments, landfills, land treatment units, and waste pile units that received waste after July 26, 1982, or that certified closure (according to § 265.115 of this chapter) after January 26, 1983, must have post-closure permits, unless they demonstrate closure by removal or decontamination as provided under § 270.1(c)(5) and (6), or obtain an enforceable document in lieu of a post-closure permit, as provided under paragraph (c)(7) of this section. If a post-closure permit is required, the permit must address applicable 40 CFR part 264 groundwater monitoring, unsaturated zone monitoring, corrective action, and post-closure care requirements of this chapter. The denial of a permit for the active life of a hazardous waste management facility or unit does not affect the requirement to obtain a post-closure permit under this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Specific inclusions.</E> Owners and operators of certain facilities require RCRA permits as well as permits under other programs for certain aspects of the facility operation. RCRA permits are required for:</P>
              <P>(i) Injection wells that dispose of hazardous waste, and associated surface facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste, (See § 270.64). However, the owner and operator with a UIC permit in a State with an approved or promulgated UIC program, will be deemed to have a RCRA permit for the injection well itself if they comply with the requirements of § 270.60(b) (permit-by-rule for injection wells).</P>
              <P>(ii) Treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste at facilities requiring an NPDES permit. However, the owner and operator of a publicly owned treatment works receiving hazardous waste will be deemed to have a RCRA permit for that waste if they comply with the requirements of § 270.60(c) (permit-by-rule for POTWs).</P>
              <P>(iii) Barges or vessels that dispose of hazardous waste by ocean disposal and onshore hazardous waste treatment or storage facilities associated with an ocean disposal operation. However, the owner and operator will be deemed to have a RCRA permit for ocean disposal from the barge or vessel itself if they comply with the requirements of § 270.60(a) (permit-by-rule for ocean disposal barges and vessels).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific exclusions and exemptions.</E> The following persons are among those who are not required to obtain a RCRA permit:<PRTPAGE P="309"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) Generators who accumulate hazardous waste on site in compliance with all of the conditions for exemption provided in 40 CFR 262.14, 262.15, 262.16, and 262.17.</P>
              <P>(ii) Farmers who dispose of hazardous waste pesticides from their own use as provided in § 262.70 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(iii) Persons who own or operate facilities solely for the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste excluded from regulations under this part by 40 CFR 261.4 or 262.14 (very small quantity generator exemption).</P>
              <P>(iv) Owners or operators of totally enclosed treatment facilities as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.</P>
              <P>(v) Owners and operators of elementary neutralization units or wastewater treatment units as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.</P>
              <P>(vi) Transporters storing manifested shipments of hazardous waste in containers meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 262.30 at a transfer facility for a period of ten days or less.</P>
              <P>(vii) Persons adding absorbent material to waste in a container (as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter) and persons adding waste to absorbent material in a container, provided that these actions occur at the time waste is first placed in the container; and §§ 264.17(b), 264.171, and 264.172 of this chapter are complied with.</P>
              <P>(viii) Universal waste handlers and universal waste transporters (as defined in 40 CFR 260.10) managing the wastes listed below. These handlers are subject to regulation under 40 part CFR 273.</P>
              <P>(A) Batteries as described in 40 CFR 273.2;</P>
              <P>(B) Pesticides as described in § 273.3 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(C) Mercury-containing equipment as described in § 273.4 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(D) Lamps as described in § 273.5 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ix) A New York State Utility central collection facility consolidating hazardous waste in accordance with 40 CFR 262.90.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Further exclusions.</E> (i) A person is not required to obtain a RCRA permit for treatment or containment activities taken during immediate response to any of the following situations:</P>
              <P>(A) A discharge of a hazardous waste;</P>
              <P>(B) An imminent and substantial threat of a discharge of hazardous waste;</P>
              <P>(C) A discharge of a material which, when discharged, becomes a hazardous waste.</P>
              <P>(D) An immediate threat to human health, public safety, property, or the environment from the known or suspected presence of military munitions, other explosive material, or an explosive device, as determined by an explosive or munitions emergency response specialist as defined in 40 CFR 260.10.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any person who continues or initiates hazardous waste treatment or containment activities after the immediate response is over is subject to all applicable requirements of this part for those activities.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of emergency responses involving military munitions, the responding military emergency response specialist's organizational unit must retain records for three years identifying the dates of the response, the responsible persons responding, the type and description of material addressed, and its disposition.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Permits for less than an entire facility.</E> EPA may issue or deny a permit for one or more units at a facility without simultaneously issuing or denying a permit to all of the units at the facility. The interim status of any unit for which a permit has not been issued or denied is not affected by the issuance or denial of a permit to any other unit at the facility.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Closure by removal.</E> Owners/operators of surface impoundments, land treatment units, and waste piles closing by removal or decontamination under part 265 standards must obtain a post-closure permit unless they can demonstrate to the Regional Administrator that the closure met the standards for closure by removal or decontamination in § 264.228, § 264.280(e), or § 264.258, respectively. The demonstration may be made in the following ways:</P>

              <P>(i) If the owner/operator has submitted a part B application for a post-closure permit, the owner/operator may request a determination, based on <PRTPAGE P="310"/>information contained in the application, that section 264 closure by removal standards were met. If the Regional Administrator believes that § 264 standards were met, he/she will notify the public of this proposed decision, allow for public comment, and reach a final determination according to the procedures in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the owner/operator has not submitted a part B application for a post-closure permit, the owner/operator may petition the Regional Administrator for a determination that a post-closure permit is not required because the closure met the applicable part 264 closure standards.</P>
              <P>(A) The petition must include data demonstrating that closure by removal or decontamination standards were met, or it must demonstrate that the unit closed under State requirements that met or exceeded the applicable 264 closure-by-removal standard.</P>
              <P>(B) The Regional Administrator shall approve or deny the petition according to the procedures outlined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Procedures for closure equivalency determination.</E> (i) If a facility owner/operator seeks an equivalency demonstration under § 270.1(c)(5), the Regional Administrator will provide the public, through a newspaper notice, the opportunity to submit written comments on the information submitted by the owner/operator within 30 days from the date of the notice. The Regional Administrator will also, in response to a request or at his/her own discretion, hold a public hearing whenever such a hearing might clarify one or more issues concerning the equivalence of the part 265 closure to a part 264 closure. The Regional Administrator will give public notice of the hearing at least 30 days before it occurs. (Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public to submit written comments, and the two notices may be combined.)</P>
              <P>(ii) The Regional Administrator will determine whether the part 265 closure met 264 closure by removal or decontamination requirements within 90 days of its receipt. If the Regional Administrator finds that the closure did not meet the applicable part 264 standards, he/she will provide the owner/operator with a written statement of the reasons why the closure failed to meet part 264 standards. The owner/operator may submit additional information in support of an equivalency demonstration within 30 days after receiving such written statement. The Regional Administrator will review any additional information submitted and make a final determination within 60 days.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the Regional Administrator determines that the facility did not close in accordance with part 264 closure by removal standards, the facility is subject to post-closure permitting requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Noncompliance and program reporting by the Director.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Director shall prepare quarterly and annual reports as detailed below. When the State is the permit-issuing authority, the State Director shall submit any reports required under this section to the Regional Administrator. When EPA is the permit-issuing authority, the Regional Administrator shall submit any report required under this section to EPA Headquarters. For purposes of this section only, RCRA permittees shall include RCRA interim status facilities, when appropriate.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Quarterly reports.</E> The Director shall submit quarterly narrative reports for major facilities as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Format.</E> The report shall use the following format:</P>
              <P>(i) Information on noncompliance for each facility;</P>
              <P>(ii) Alphabetize by permittee name. When two or more permittees have the same name, the lowest permit number shall be entered first; and</P>
              <P>(iii) For each entry on the list, include the following information in the following order:</P>

              <P>(A) Name, location, and permit number of the noncomplying permittee.<PRTPAGE P="316"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) A brief description and date of each instance of noncompliance for that permittee. Instances of noncompliance may include one or more of the kinds set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. When a permittee has noncompliance of more than one kind, combine the information into a single entry for each such permittee.</P>
              <P>(C) The date(s) and a brief description of the action(s) taken by the Director to ensure compliance.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Instances of noncompliance to be reported.</E> Any instances of noncompliance within the following categories shall be reported in successive reports until the noncompliance is reported as resolved. Once noncompliance is reported as resolved it need not appear in subsequent reports.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Failure to complete construction elements.</E> When the permittee has failed to complete, by the date specified in the permit, an element of a compliance schedule involving either planning for construction (for example, award of a contract, preliminary plans), or a construction step (for example, begin construction, attain operation level); and the permittee has not returned to compliance by accomplishing the required element of the schedule within 30 days from the date a compliance schedule report is due under the permit.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Modifications to schedules of compliance.</E> When a schedule of compliance in the permit has been modified under § 270.41 or § 270.42 because of the permittee's noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Failure to complete or provide compliance schedule or monitoring reports.</E> When the permittee has failed to complete or provide a report required in a permit compliance schedule (for example, progress report or notice of noncompliance or compliance) or a monitoring report; and the permittee has not submitted the complete report within 30 days from the date it is due under the permit for compliance schedules, or from the date specified in the permit for monitoring reports.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Deficient reports.</E> When the required reports provided by the permittee are so deficient as to cause misunderstanding by the Director and thus impede the review of the status of compliance.</P>

              <P>(B) When the Director determines that a pattern of noncompliance exists for a major facility permittee over the most recent four consecutive reporting periods. This pattern includes any violation of the same requirement in two consecutive reporting periods, and any violation of one or more requirements in each of four consecutive reporting periods; or</P>
              <P>(C) When the Director determines significant permit non-compliance or other significant event has occurred such as a fire or explosion or migration of fluids into a USDW.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">All other.</E> Statistical information shall be reported quarterly on all other instances of noncompliance by major facilities with permit requirements not otherwise reported under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General application requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Applying for a permit. Below is information on how to obtain a permit and where to find requirements for specific permits:</P>
              <P>(1) If you are covered by RCRA permits by rule (§ 270.60), you need not apply.</P>
              <P>(2) If you currently have interim status, you must apply for permits when required by the Director.</P>
              <P>(3) If you are required to have a permit (including new applicants and permittees with expiring permits), you must complete, sign, and submit an application to the Director, as described in this section and §§ 270.70 through 270.73.</P>
              <P>(4) If you are seeking an emergency permit, the procedures for application, issuance, and administration are found exclusively in § 270.61.</P>
              <P>(5) If you are seeking a research, development, and demonstration permit, the procedures for application, issuance, and administration are found exclusively in § 270.65.</P>
              <P>(6) If you are seeking a standardized permit, the procedures for application and issuance are found in part 124, subpart G of this chapter and subpart J of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Who applies?</E> When a facility or activity is owned by one person but is operated by another person, it is the operator's duty to obtain a permit, except that the owner must also sign the permit application.<PRTPAGE P="318"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Completeness.</E> The Director shall not issue a permit before receiving a complete application for a permit except for permits by rule, or emergency permits. An application for a permit is complete when the Director receives an application form and any supplemental information which are completed to his satisfaction. An application for a permit is complete notwithstanding the failure of the owner or operator to submit the exposure information described in paragraph (j) of this section. The Director may deny a permit for the active life of a hazardous waste management facility or unit before receiving a complete application for a permit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Information requirements.</E> All applicants for RCRA permits shall provide information set forth in § 270.13 and applicable sections in §§ 270.14 through 270.29 to the Director, using the application form provided by the Director.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Existing HWM facilities and interim status qualifications.</E> (1) Owners and operators of existing hazardous waste management facilities or of hazardous waste management facilities in existence on the effective date of statutory or regulatory amendments under the act that render the facility subject to the requirement to have a RCRA permit must submit part A of their permit application no later than:</P>
              <P>(i) Six months after the date of publication of regulations which first require them to comply with the standards set forth in 40 CFR part 265 or 266, or</P>
              <P>(ii) Thirty days after the date they first become subject to the standards set forth in 40 CFR part 265 or 266, whichever first occurs.</P>

              <P>(iii) For generators generating greater than 100 kilograms but less than 1000 kilograms of hazardous waste in a calendar month and treats, stores, or disposes of these wastes on-site, by March 24, 1987.
              </P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>

                <P>For facilities which must comply with part 265 because they handle a waste listed in EPA's May 19, 1980, part 261 regulations (45 FR 33006 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the deadline for submitting an application is November 19, 1980. Where other existing facilities must begin in complying with part 265 or 266 at a later date because of revisions to part 260, 261, 265, or 266, the Administrator will specify in the preamble to those revisions when those facilities must submit a permit application.</P>
              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(2) The Administrator may by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> extend the date by which owners and operators of specified classes of existing hazardous waste management facilities must submit part A of their permit application if he finds that (i) there has been substantial confusion as to whether the owners and operators of such facilities were required to file a permit application and (ii) such confusion is attributed to ambiguities in EPA's parts 260, 261, 265, or 266 regulations.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator may by compliance order issued under section 3008 of RCRA extend the date by which the owner and operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility must submit part A of their permit application.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility may be required to submit part B of their permit application. The State Director may require submission of part B (or equivalent completion of the State RCRA application process) if the State in which the facility is located has received interim or final authorization; if not, the Regional Administrator may require submission of Part B. Any owner or operator shall be allowed at least six months from the date of request to submit part B of the application. Any owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility may voluntarily submit part B of the application at any time. Notwithstanding the above, any owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility must submit a part B permit application in accordance with the dates specified in § 270.73. Any owner or operator of a land disposal facility in existence on the effective date of statutory or regulatory amendments under this Act that render the facility subject to the requirement to have a RCRA permit must submit a part B application in accordance with the dates specified in § 270.73.</P>

              <P>(5) Failure to furnish a requested part B application on time, or to furnish in full the information required by the part B application, is grounds for <PRTPAGE P="319"/>termination of interim status under part 124.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">New HWM facilities.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, no person shall begin physical construction of a new HWM facility without having submitted parts A and B of the permit application and having received a finally effective RCRA permit.</P>

              <P>(2) An application for a permit for a new hazardous waste management facility (including both Parts A and B) may be filed any time after promulgation of those standards in part 264, subpart I <E T="03">et seq.</E> applicable to such facility. The application shall be filed with the Regional Administrator if at the time of application the State in which the new hazardous waste management facility is proposed to be located has not received interim or final authorization for permitting such facility; otherwise it shall be filed with the State Director. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, all applications must be submitted at least 180 days before physical construction is expected to commence.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a person may construct a facility for the incineration of polychlorinated biphenyls pursuant to an approval issued by the Administrator under section (6)(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act and any person owning or operating such a facility may, at any time after construction or operation of such facility has begun, file an application for a RCRA permit to incinerate hazardous waste authorizing such facility to incinerate waste identified or listed under Subtitle C of RCRA.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Updating permit applications.</E> (1) If any owner or operator of a hazardous waste management facility has filed Part A of a permit application and has not yet filed part B, the owner or operator shall file an amended part A application:</P>
              <P>(i) With the Regional Administrator if the facility is located in a State which has not obtained interim authorization or final authorization, within six months after the promulgation of revised regulations under part 261 listing or identifying additional hazardous wastes, if the facility is treating, storing or disposing of any of those newly listed or identified wastes.</P>
              <P>(ii) With the State Director, if the facility is located in a State which has obtained interim authorization or final authorization, no later than the effective date of regulatory provisions listing or designating wastes as hazardous in that State in addition to those listed or designated under the previously approved State program, if the facility is treating, storing or disposing of any of those newly listed or designated wastes; or</P>
              <P>(iii) As necessary to comply with provisions of § 270.72 for changes during interim status or with the analogous provisions of a State program approved for final authorization or interim authorization. Revised Part A applications necessary to comply with the provisions of § 270.72 shall be filed with the Regional Administrator if the State in which the facility in question is located does not have interim authorization or final authorization; otherwise it shall be filed with the State Director (if the State has an analogous provision).</P>
              <P>(2) The owner or operator of a facility who fails to comply with the updating requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not receive interim status as to the wastes not covered by duly filed part A applications.</P>
              <P>(h) Reapplying for a permit. If you have an effective permit and you want to reapply for a new one, you have two options:</P>
              <P>(1) You may submit a new application at least 180 days before the expiration date of the effective permit, unless the Director allows a later date; or</P>
              <P>(2) If you intend to be covered by a standardized permit, you may submit a Notice of Intent as described in § 270.51(e)(1) at least 180 days before the expiration date of the effective permit, unless the Director allows a later date. The Director may not allow you to submit applications or Notices of Intent later than the expiration date of the existing permit, except as allowed by § 270.51(e)(2).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> Applicants shall keep records of all data used to complete permit applications and any supplemental information submitted under §§ 270.10(d), 270.13, 270.14 through <PRTPAGE P="320"/>270.21 for a period of at least 3 years from the date the application is signed.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Exposure information.</E> (1) After August 8, 1985, any part B permit application submitted by an owner or operator of a facility that stores, treats, or disposes of hazardous waste in a surface impoundment or a landfill must be accompanied by information, reasonably ascertainable by the owner or operator, on the potential for the public to be exposed to hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents through releases related to the unit. At a minimum, such information must address:</P>
              <P>(i) Reasonably foreseeable potential releases from both normal operations and accidents at the unit, including releases associated with transportation to or from the unit;</P>
              <P>(ii) The potential pathways of human exposure to hazardous wastes or constituents resulting from the releases described under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(l) If the Director concludes, based on one or more of the factors listed in paragraph (l)(1) of this section that compliance with the standards of 40 CFR part 63, subpart EEE alone may not be protective of human health or the environment, the Director shall require the additional information or assessment(s) necessary to determine whether additional controls are necessary to ensure protection of human health and the environment. This includes information necessary to evaluate the potential risk to human health and/or the environment resulting from both direct and indirect exposure pathways. The Director may also require a permittee or applicant to provide information necessary to determine whether such an assessment(s) should be required.</P>
              <P>(1) The Director shall base the evaluation of whether compliance with the standards of 40 CFR part 63, subpart EEE alone is protective of human health or the environment on factors relevant to the potential risk from a hazardous waste combustion unit, including, as appropriate, any of the following factors:</P>
              <P>(i) Particular site-specific considerations such as proximity to receptors (such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, day care centers, parks, community activity centers, or other potentially sensitive receptors), unique dispersion patterns, etc.;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identities and quantities of emissions of persistent, bioaccumulative or toxic pollutants considering enforceable controls in place to limit those pollutants;</P>
              <P>(iii) Identities and quantities of nondioxin products of incomplete combustion most likely to be emitted and to pose significant risk based on known toxicities (confirmation of which should be made through emissions testing);</P>
              <P>(iv) Identities and quantities of other off-site sources of pollutants in proximity of the facility that significantly influence interpretation of a facility-specific risk assessment;</P>
              <P>(v) Presence of significant ecological considerations, such as the proximity of a particularly sensitive ecological area;</P>
              <P>(vi) Volume and types of wastes, for example wastes containing highly toxic constituents;</P>
              <P>(vii) Other on-site sources of hazardous air pollutants that significantly influence interpretation of the risk posed by the operation of the source in question;</P>
              <P>(viii) Adequacy of any previously conducted risk assessment, given any subsequent changes in conditions likely to affect risk; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Such other factors as may be appropriate.<PRTPAGE P="321"/>

              <P>(b)(1) Each RCRA permit shall include permit conditions necessary to achieve compliance with the Act and regulations, including each of the applicable requirements specified in parts 264 and 266 through 268 of this chapter. In satisfying this provision, the Administrator may incorporate applicable requirements of parts 264 and 266 through 268 of this chapter directly into the permit or establish other permit conditions that are based on these parts.</P>
              <P>(2) Each permit issued under section 3005 of this act shall contain terms and conditions as the Administrator or State Director determines necessary to protect human health and the environment.</P>
              <P>(3) If, as the result of an assessment(s) or other information, the Administrator or Director determines that conditions are necessary in addition to those required under 40 CFR parts 63, subpart EEE, 264 or 266 to ensure protection of human health and the environment, he shall include those terms and conditions in a RCRA permit for a hazardous waste combustion unit.</P>

              <P>(c) For a State issued permit, an applicable requirement is a State statutory or regulatory requirement which takes effect prior to final administrative disposition of a permit. For a permit issued by EPA, an applicable requirement is a statutory or regulatory requirement (including any interim final regulation) which takes effect prior to the issuance of the permit. Section 124.14 (reopening of comment period) provides a means for reopening EPA permit proceedings at the discretion of the Director where new requirements become effective during the permitting process and are of sufficient <PRTPAGE P="347"/>magnitude to make additional proceedings desirable. For State and EPA administered programs, an applicable requirement is also any requirement which takes effect prior to the modification or revocation and reissuance of a permit, to the extent allowed in § 270.41.</P>
              <P>(d) New or reissued permits, and to the extent allowed under § 270.41, modified or revoked and reissued permits, shall incorporate each of the applicable requirements referenced in this section and in 40 CFR 270.31.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim dates.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, if a permit establishes a schedule of compliance which exceeds 1 year from the date of permit issuance, the schedule shall set forth interim requirements and the dates for their achievement.</P>
              <P>(i) The time between interim dates shall not exceed 1 year.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the time necessary for completion of any interim requirement is more than 1 year and is not readily divisible into stages for completion, the permit shall specify interim dates for the submission of reports of progress toward completion of the interim requirements and indicate a projected completion date.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> The permit shall be written to require that no later than 14 days following each interim date and the final date of compliance, the permittee shall notify the Director in writing, of its compliance or noncompliance with the interim or final requirements.</P>

              <P>(1) If the permittee decides to cease conducting regulated activities at a given time within the term of a permit which has already been issued:</P>
              <P>(i) The permit may be modified to contain a new or additional schedule leading to timely cessation of activities; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The permittee shall cease conducting permitted activities before noncompliance with any interim or final compliance schedule requirement already specified in the permit.</P>
              <P>(2) If the decision to cease conducting regulated activities is made before issuance of a permit whose term will include the termination date, the permit shall contain a schedule leading to termination which will ensure timely compliance with applicable requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) If the permittee is undecided whether to cease conducting regulated activities, the Director may issue or modify a permit to contain two schedules as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Both schedules shall contain an identical interim deadline requiring a final decision on whether to cease conducting regulated activities no later than a date which ensures sufficient time to comply with applicable requirements in a timely manner if the decision is to continue conducting regulated activities;</P>
              <P>(ii) One schedule shall lead to timely compliance with applicable requirements;</P>
              <P>(iii) The second schedule shall lead to cessation of regulated activities by a date which will ensure timely compliance with applicable requirements;</P>

              <P>(iv) Each permit containing two schedules shall include a requirement that after the permittee has made a final decision under paragraph (b)(3)(i) <PRTPAGE P="348"/>of this section it shall follow the schedule leading to compliance if the decision is to continue conducting regulated activities, and follow the schedule leading to termination if the decision is to cease conducting regulated activities.</P>
              <P>(4) The applicant's or permittee's decision to cease conducting regulated activities shall be evidenced by a firm public commitment satisfactory to the Director, such as resolution of the board of directors of a corporation.</P>

              <P>(a) A permit may be transferred by the permittee to a new owner or operator only if the permit has been modified or revoked and reissued (under § 270.40(b) or § 270.41(b)(2)) to identify the new permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary under the appropriate Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Changes in the ownership or operational control of a facility may be made as a Class 1 modification with prior written approval of the Director in accordance with § 270.42 or as a routine change with prior approval under 40 CFR 124.213. The new owner or operator must submit a revised permit application no later than 90 days prior to the scheduled change. A written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility between the current and new permittees must also be submitted to the Director. When a transfer of ownership or operational control occurs, the old owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart H (Financial Requirements) until the new owner or operator has demonstrated that he or she is complying with the requirements of that subpart. The new owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with subpart H requirements within six months of the date of the change of ownership or operational control of the facility. Upon demonstration to the Director by the new owner or operator of compliance with subpart H, the Director shall notify the old owner or operator that he or she no longer needs to comply with subpart H as of the date of demonstration.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Modification or revocation and reissuance of permits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When the Director receives any information (for example, inspects the facility, receives information submitted by the permittee as required in the permit (see § 270.30), receives a request for revocation and reissuance under § 124.5 or conducts a review of the permit file), he or she may determine whether one or more of the causes listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for modification, or revocation and reissuance or both exist. If cause exists, the Director may modify or revoke and reissue the permit accordingly, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section, and may request an updated application if necessary. When a permit is modified, only the conditions subject to modification are reopened. If a permit is revoked and reissued, the entire permit is reopened and subject to revision and the permit is reissued for a new term. (See 40 CFR 124.5(c)(2).) If cause does not exist under this section, the Director shall not modify or revoke and reissue the permit, except on request of the permittee. If a permit modification is requested by the permittee, the Director shall approve or deny the request according to the procedures of § 270.42, or § 270.320 and 40 CFR part 124, subpart G. Otherwise, a draft permit must be prepared and other procedures in part 124 (or procedures of an authorized State program) followed.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Causes for modification.</E> The following are causes for modification, but not revocation and reissuance, of permits; the following may be causes for revocation and reissuance, as well as modification, when the permittee requests or agrees.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Alterations.</E> There are material and substantial alterations or additions to the permitted facility or activity which occurred after permit issuance which justify the application of permit conditions that are different or absent in the existing permit.<PRTPAGE P="349"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Information.</E> The Director has received information. Permits may be modified during their terms for this cause only if the information was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and would have justified the application of different permit conditions at the time of issuance.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">New statutory requirements or regulations.</E> The standards or regulations on which the permit was based have been changed by statute, through promulgation of new or amended standards or regulations, or by judicial decision after the permit was issued.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Compliance schedules.</E> The Director determines good cause exists for modification of a compliance schedule, such as an act of God, strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which the permittee has little or no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, when a permit for a land disposal facility is reviewed by the Director under § 270.50(d), the Director shall modify the permit as necessary to assure that the facility continues to comply with the currently applicable requirements in parts 124, 260 through 266, and 270.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Causes for modification or revocation and reissuance.</E> The following are causes to modify or, alternatively, revoke and reissue a permit:</P>
              <P>(1) Cause exists for termination under § 270.43, and the Director determines that modification or revocation and reissuance is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director has received notification (as required in the permit, see § 270.30(l)(3)) of a proposed transfer of the permit.</P>
              <P>(3) The Director has received notification under 40 CFR 124.202(b) of a facility owner or operator's intent to be covered by a standardized permit.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Facility siting.</E> Suitability of the facility location will not be considered at the time of permit modification or revocation and reissuance unless new information or standards indicate that a threat to human health or the environment exists which was unknown at the time of permit issuance.</P>

              <P>(3) The permittee must place a copy of the permit modification request and supporting documents in a location accessible to the public in the vicinity of the permitted facility.</P>
              <P>(4) The permittee must hold a public meeting no earlier than 15 days after the publication of the notice required in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and no later than 15 days before the close of the 60-day comment period. The meeting must be held to the extent practicable in the vicinity of the permitted facility.</P>
              <P>(5) The public shall be provided 60 days to comment on the modification request. The comment period will begin on the date the permittee publishes the notice in the local newspaper. Comments should be submitted to the Agency contact identified in the public notice.</P>

              <P>(C) Determine that the modification request must follow the procedures in § 270.42(c) for Class 3 modifications for the following reasons:</P>

The authorized activities must be conducted as described in the permit modification request and must be in compliance with all appropriate standards of 40 CFR part 265. If the Director approves, with or without changes, or denies the modification request during the term of the temporary or automatic authorization provided for in paragraphs (b)(6) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, such action cancels the temporary or automatic authorization.</P>
              <P>(iv)(A) In the case of an automatic authorization under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, or a temporary authorization under paragraph (b)(6) (i)(D) or (ii)(D) of this section, if the Director has not made a final approval or denial of the modification request by the date 50 days prior to the end of the temporary or automatic authorization, the permittee must within seven days of that time send a notification to persons on the facility mailing list, and make a reasonable effort to notify other persons who submitted written comments on the modification request, that:</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Unless the Director acts to give final approval or denial of the request by the end of the authorization period, the permittee will receive authorization to conduct such activities for the life of the permit.</P>
              <P>(B) If the owner/operator fails to notify the public by the date specified in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(A) of this section, the effective date of the permanent authorization will be deferred until 50 days after the owner/operator notifies the public.</P>
              <P>(v) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(vii) of this section, if the Director does not finally approve or deny a modification request before the end of the automatic or temporary authorization period or reclassify the modification as a Class 3, the permittee is authorized to conduct the activities described in the permit modification request for the life of the permit unless modified later under § 270.41 or § 270.42. The activities authorized under this paragraph must be conducted as described in the permit modification request and must be in compliance with all appropriate standards of 40 CFR part 265.</P>
              <P>(vi) In making a decision to approve or deny a modification request, including a decision to issue a temporary authorization or to reclassify a modification as a Class 3, the Director must consider all written comments submitted to the Agency during the public comment period and must respond in writing to all significant comments in his or her decision.</P>
              <P>(vii) With the written consent of the permittee, the Director may extend indefinitely or for a specified period the time periods for final approval or denial of a modification request or for reclassifying a modification as a Class 3.</P>
              <P>(7) The Director may deny or change the terms of a Class 2 permit modification request under paragraphs (b)(6) (i) through (iii) of this section for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(i) The modification request is incomplete;</P>
              <P>(ii) The requested modification does not comply with the appropriate requirements of 40 CFR part 264 or other applicable requirements; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The conditions of the modification fail to protect human health and the environment.</P>

              <P>(8) The permittee may perform any construction associated with a Class 2 permit modification request beginning 60 days after the submission of the request unless the Director establishes a later date for commencing construction and informs the permittee in writing before day 60.<PRTPAGE P="352"/>

In addition, the Director must consider and respond to all significant written comments received during the 60-day comment period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Other modifications.</E> (1) In the case of modifications not explicitly listed in appendix I of this section, the permittee may submit a Class 3 modification request to the Agency, or he or she may request a determination by the Director that the modification should be reviewed and approved as a Class 1 or Class 2 modification. If the permittee requests that the modification be classified as a Class 1 or 2 modification, he or she must provide the Agency with the necessary information to support the requested classification.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director shall make the determination described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as promptly as practicable.

              <P>When an owner or operator of a hazardous waste incineration unit becomes subject to RCRA permit requirements after October 12, 2005, or when an owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste incineration unit demonstrates compliance with the air emission standards and limitations in part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting a Notification of Compliance under §§ 63.1207(j) and 63.1210(d) of this chapter documenting compliance with all applicable requirements of part 63, subpart EEE, of this chapter), the requirements of this section do not apply, except those provisions the Director determines are necessary to ensure compliance with §§ 264.345(a) and 264.345(c) of this chapter if you elect to comply with § 270.235(a)(1)(i) to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events. Nevertheless, the Director may apply the provisions of this section, on a case-by-case basis, for purposes of information collection in accordance with §§ 270.10(k), 270.10(l), 270.32(b)(2), and 270.32(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(a) For the purposes of determining operational readiness following completion of physical construction, the Director must establish permit conditions, including but not limited to allowable waste feeds and operating conditions, in the permit to a new hazardous waste incinerator. These permit conditions will be effective for the minimum time required to bring the incinerator to a point of operational readiness to conduct a trial burn, not to exceed 720 hours operating time for treatment of hazardous waste. The Director may extend the duration of this operational period once, for up to 720 additional hours, at the request of the applicant when good cause is shown. The permit may be modified to reflect the extension according to § 270.42 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(1) Applicants must submit a statement, with part B of the permit application, which suggests the conditions necessary to operate in compliance with the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter during this period. This statement should include, at a minimum, restrictions on waste constituents, waste feed rates and the operating parameters identified in § 264.345 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director will review this statement and any other relevant information submitted with part B of the permit application and specify requirements for this period sufficient to meet the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter based on his engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of determining feasibility of compliance with the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter and of determining adequate operating conditions under § 264.345 of this chapter, the Director must establish conditions in the permit for a new hazardous waste incinerator to be effective during the trial burn.</P>
              <P>(1) Applicants must propose a trial burn plan, prepared under paragraph (b)(2) of this section with a part B of the permit application.</P>
              <P>(2) The trial burn plan must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) An analysis of each waste or mixture of wastes to be burned which includes:</P>
              <P>(A) Heat value of the waste in the form and composition in which it will be burned.</P>
              <P>(B) Viscosity (if applicable), or description of the physical form of the waste.</P>

              <P>(C) An identification of any hazardous organic constituents listed in part 261, appendix VIII of this chapter, which are present in the waste to be burned, except that the applicant need not analyze for constituents listed in <PRTPAGE P="364"/>part 261, appendix VIII, of this chapter which would reasonably not be expected to be found in the waste. The constituents excluded from analysis must be identified, and the basis for the exclusion stated. The waste analysis must rely on appropriate analytical techniques.</P>
              <P>(D) An approximate quantification of the hazardous constituents identified in the waste, within the precision produced by appropriate analytical methods.</P>
              <P>(ii) A detailed engineering description of the incinerator for which the permit is sought including:</P>
              <P>(A) Manufacturer's name and model number of incinerator (if available).</P>
              <P>(B) Type of incinerator.</P>
              <P>(C) Linear dimensions of the incinerator unit including the cross sectional area of combustion chamber.</P>
              <P>(D) Description of the auxiliary fuel system (type/feed).</P>

              <P>(3) The Director, in reviewing the trial burn plan, shall evaluate the sufficiency of the information provided and may require the applicant to supplement this information, if necessary, to achieve the purposes of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(4) Based on the waste analysis data in the trial burn plan, the Director will specify as trial Principal Organic Hazardous Constituents (POHCs), those constituents for which destruction and removal efficiencies must be calculated during the trial burn. These trial POHCs will be specified by the Director based on his estimate of the difficulty of incineration of the constituents identified in the waste analysis, their concentration or mass in the waste feed, and, for wastes listed in part 261, subpart D, of this chapter, the hazardous waste organic constituent or constituents identified in appendix VII of that part as the basis for listing.</P>
              <P>(5) The Director shall approve a trial burn plan if he finds that:</P>
              <P>(i) The trial burn is likely to determine whether the incinerator performance standard required by § 264.343 of this chapter can be met;</P>
              <P>(ii) The trial burn itself will not present an imminent hazard to human health or the environment;</P>
              <P>(iii) The trial burn will help the Director to determine operating requirements to be specified under § 264.345 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The information sought in paragraphs (b)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section cannot reasonably be developed through other means.</P>

              <P>(6) The Director must send a notice to all persons on the facility mailing list as set forth in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1)(ix) and to the appropriate units of State and local government as set forth in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(1)(x) announcing the scheduled commencement and completion dates for the trial <PRTPAGE P="365"/>burn. The applicant may not commence the trial burn until after the Director has issued such notice.</P>
              <P>(i) This notice must be mailed within a reasonable time period before the scheduled trial burn. An additional notice is not required if the trial burn is delayed due to circumstances beyond the control of the facility or the permitting agency.</P>
              <P>(ii) This notice must contain:</P>
              <P>(A) The name and telephone number of the applicant's contact person;</P>
              <P>(B) The name and telephone number of the permitting agency's contact office;</P>
              <P>(C) The location where the approved trial burn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed and copied; and</P>
              <P>(D) An expected time period for commencement and completion of the trial burn.</P>

              <P>(vii) An identification of sources of fugitive emissions and their means of control.</P>
              <P>(viii) A measurement of average, maximum, and minimum temperatures and combustion gas velocity.</P>
              <P>(ix) A continuous measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) in the exhaust gas.</P>
              <P>(x) Such other information as the Director may specify as necessary to ensure that the trial burn will determine compliance with the performance standards in § 264.343 of this chapter and to establish the operating conditions required by § 264.345 of this chapter as necessary to meet that performance standard.</P>
              <P>(8) The applicant must submit to the Director a certification that the trial burn has been carried out in accordance with the approved trial burn plan, and must submit the results of all the determinations required in paragraph (b)(6) of this section. This submission shall be made within 90 days of completion of the trial burn, or later if approved by the Director.</P>
              <P>(9) All data collected during any trial burn must be submitted to the Director following the completion of the trial burn.</P>
              <P>(10) All submissions required by this paragraph must be certified on behalf of the applicant by the signature of a person authorized to sign a permit application or a report under § 270.11.</P>
              <P>(11) Based on the results of the trial burn, the Director shall set the operating requirements in the final permit according to § 264.345 of this chapter. The permit modification shall proceed according to § 270.42.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purposes of allowing operation of a new hazardous waste incinerator following completion of the trial burn and prior to final modification of the permit conditions to reflect the trial burn results, the Director may establish permit conditions, including but not limited to allowable waste feeds and operating conditions sufficient to meet the requirements of § 264.345 of this chapter, in the permit to a new hazardous waste incinerator. These permit conditions will be effective for the minimum time required to complete sample analysis, data computation and submission of the trial burn results by the applicant, and modification of the facility permit by the Director.</P>

              <P>(1) Applicants must submit a statement, with part B of the permit application, which identifies the conditions necessary to operate in compliance with the performance standards of <PRTPAGE P="366"/>§ 264.343 of this chapter, during this period. This statement should include, at a minimum, restrictions on waste constituents, waste feed rates, and the operating parameters in § 264.345 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The Director will review this statement and any other relevant information submitted with part B of the permit application and specify those requirements for this period most likely to meet the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter based on his engineering judgment.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purpose of determining feasibility of compliance with the performance standards of § 264.343 of this chapter and of determining adequate operating conditions under § 264.345 of this chapter, the applicant for a permit for an existing hazardous waste incinerator must prepare and submit a trial burn plan and perform a trial burn in accordance with § 270.19(b) and paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) and (b)(7) through (b)(10) of this section or, instead, submit other information as specified in § 270.19(c). The Director must announce his or her intention to approve the trial burn plan in accordance with the timing and distribution requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section. The contents of the notice must include: the name and telephone number of a contact person at the facility; the name and telephone number of a contact office at the permitting agency; the location where the trial burn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed and copied; and a schedule of the activities that are required prior to permit issuance, including the anticipated time schedule for agency approval of the plan and the time period during which the trial burn would be conducted. Applicants submitting information under § 270.19(a) are exempt from compliance with 40 CFR 264.343 and 264.345 and, therefore, are exempt from the requirement to conduct a trial burn. Applicants who submit trial burn plans and receive approval before submission of a permit application must complete the trial burn and submit the results, specified in paragraph (b)(7) of this section, with part B of the permit application. If completion of this process conflicts with the date set for submission of the part B application, the applicant must contact the Director to establish a later date for submission of the part B application or the trial burn results. Trial burn results must be submitted prior to issuance of the permit. When the applicant submits a trial burn plan with part B of the permit application, the Director will specify a time period prior to permit issuance in which the trial burn must be conducted and the results submitted.</P>

              <P>(a) For the purpose of allowing an owner or operator to meet the treatment demonstration requirements of § 264.272 of this chapter, the Director may issue a treatment demonstration permit. The permit must contain only those requirements necessary to meet the standards in § 264.272(c). The permit may be issued either as a treatment or disposal permit covering only the field test or laboratory analyses, or as a two-phase facility permit covering the field tests, or laboratory analyses, and design, construction operation and maintenance of the land treatment unit.</P>
              <P>(1) The Director may issue a two-phase facility permit if he finds that, based on information submitted in part B of the application, substantial, although incomplete or inconclusive, information already exists upon which to base the issuance of a facility permit.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Director finds that not enough information exists upon which he can establish permit conditions to attempt to provide for compliance with all of the requirements of subpart M, he must issue a treatment demonstration permit covering only the field test or laboratory analyses.</P>

              <P>(b) If the Director finds that a phased permit may be issued, he will establish, as requirements in the first phase of the facility permit, conditions for conducting the field tests or laboratory analyses. These permit conditions will <PRTPAGE P="367"/>include design and operating parameters (including the duration of the tests or analyses and, in the case of field tests, the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the treatment zone), monitoring procedures, post-demonstration clean-up activities, and any other conditions which the Director finds may be necessary under § 264.272(c). The Director will include conditions in the second phase of the facility permit to attempt to meet all subpart M requirements pertaining to unit design, construction, operation, and maintenance. The Director will establish these conditions in the second phase of the permit based upon the substantial but incomplete or inconclusive information contained in the part B application.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), the owner or operator of an interim status facility may make the following changes at the facility:</P>
              <P>(1) Treatment, storage, or disposal of new hazardous wastes not previously identified in part A of the permit application (and, in the case of newly listed or identified wastes, addition of the units being used to treat, store, or dispose of the hazardous wastes on the effective date of the listing or identification) if the owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application prior to such treatment, storage, or disposal;</P>
              <P>(2) Increases in the design capacity of processes used at the facility if the owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application prior to such a change (along with a justification explaining the need for the change) and the Director approves the changes because:</P>
              <P>(i) There is a lack of available treatment, storage, or disposal capacity at other hazardous waste management facilities, or</P>
              <P>(ii) The change is necessary to comply with a Federal, State, or local requirement.</P>
              <P>(3) Changes in the processes for the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste or addition of processes if the owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application prior to such change (along with a justification explaining the need for the change) and the Director approves the change because:</P>
              <P>(i) The change is necessary to prevent a threat to human health and the environment because of an emergency situation, or</P>
              <P>(ii) The change is necessary to comply with a Federal, State, or local requirement.</P>

              <P>(4) Changes in the ownership or operational control of a facility if the new owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application no later than 90 days prior to the scheduled change. When a transfer of operational control of a facility occurs, the old owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart H (Financial Requirements), until the new owner or operator has demonstrated to the Director that he is complying with the requirements of that subpart. The new owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with subpart H requirements within six months of the date of the change in ownership or operational control of the facility. Upon demonstration to the Director by the new owner or operator of <PRTPAGE P="374"/>compliance with subpart H, the Director shall notify the old owner or operator in writing that he no longer needs to comply with subpart H as of the date of demonstration. All other interim status duties are transferred effective immediately upon the date of the change in ownership or operational control of the facility.</P>
              <P>(5) Changes made in accordance with an interim status corrective action order issued by EPA under section 3008(h) or other Federal authority, by an authorized State under comparable State authority, or by a court in a judicial action brought by EPA or by an authorized State. Changes under this paragraph are limited to the treatment, storage, or disposal of solid waste from releases that originate within the boundary of the facility.</P>
              <P>(6) Addition of newly regulated units for the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste if the owner or operator submits a revised part A permit application on or before the date on which the unit becomes subject to the new requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as specifically allowed under this paragraph, changes listed under paragraph (a) of this section may not be made if they amount to reconstruction of the hazardous waste management facility. Reconstruction occurs when the capital investment in the changes to the facility exceeds 50 percent of the capital cost of a comparable entirely new hazardous waste management facility. If all other requirements are met, the following changes may be made even if they amount to a reconstruction:</P>
              <P>(1) Changes made solely for the purposes of complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 265.193 for tanks and ancillary equipment.</P>
              <P>(2) If necessary to comply with Federal, State, or local requirements, changes to an existing unit, changes solely involving tanks or containers, or addition of replacement surface impoundments that satisfy the standards of section 3004(o).</P>
              <P>(3) Changes that are necessary to allow owners or operators to continue handling newly listed or identified hazardous wastes that have been treated, stored, or disposed of at the facility prior to the effective date of the rule establishing the new listing or identification.</P>
              <P>(4) Changes during closure of a facility or of a unit within a facility made in accordance with an approved closure plan.</P>
              <P>(5) Changes necessary to comply with an interim status corrective action order issued by EPA under section 3008(h) or other Federal authority, by an authorized State under comparable State authority, or by a court in a judicial proceeding brought by EPA or an authorized State, provided that such changes are limited to the treatment, storage, or disposal of solid waste from releases that originate within the boundary of the facility.</P>
              <P>(6) Changes to treat or store, in tanks, containers, or containment buildings, hazardous wastes subject to land disposal restrictions imposed by part 268 of this chapter or RCRA section 3004, provided that such changes are made solely for the purpose of complying with part 268 of this chapter or RCRA section 3004.</P>
              <P>(7) Addition of newly regulated units under paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(8) Changes necessary to comply with standards under 40 CFR part 63, Subpart EEE—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Hazardous Waste Combustors.</P>

                <SUBJECT>What is a RAP?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A RAP is a special form of RCRA permit that you, as an owner or operator, may obtain, instead of a permit issued under §§ 270.3 through 270.66, to authorize you to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous remediation waste (as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter) at a remediation waste management site. A RAP may only be issued for the area of contamination where the remediation wastes to be managed under the RAP originated, or areas in close proximity to the contaminated area, except as allowed in limited circumstances under § 270.230.</P>
                <P>(b) The requirements in §§ 270.3 through 270.66 do not apply to RAPs unless those requirements for traditional RCRA permits are specifically required under §§ 270.80 through 270.230. The definitions in § 270.2 apply to RAPs.</P>
                <P>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part or part 124 of this chapter, any document that meets the requirements in this section constitutes a RCRA permit under RCRA section 3005(c).</P>
                <P>(d) A RAP may be:</P>
                <P>(1) A stand-alone document that includes only the information and conditions required by this subpart; or</P>

                <P>(2) Part (or parts) of another document that includes information and/or conditions for other activities at the remediation waste management site, in addition to the information and conditions required by this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="376"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) If you are treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous remediation wastes as part of a cleanup compelled by Federal or State cleanup authorities, your RAP does not affect your obligations under those authorities in any way.</P>
                <P>(f) If you receive a RAP at a facility operating under interim status, the RAP does not terminate your interim status.</P>

                <SECTNO>§ 270.85</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>When do I need a RAP?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Whenever you treat, store, or dispose of hazardous remediation wastes in a manner that requires a RCRA permit under § 270.1, you must either obtain:</P>
                <P>(1) A RCRA permit according to §§ 270.3 through 270.66; or</P>
                <P>(2) A RAP according to this subpart.</P>
                <P>(b) Treatment units that use combustion of hazardous remediation wastes at a remediation waste management site are not eligible for RAPs under this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) You may obtain a RAP for managing hazardous remediation waste at an already permitted RCRA facility. You must have these RAPs approved as a modification to your existing permit according to the requirements of § 270.41 or § 270.42 instead of the requirements in this subpart. When you submit an application for such a modification, however, the information requirements in § 270.42(a)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iv), and (c)(1)(iv) do not apply; instead, you must submit the information required under § 270.110. When your permit is modified the RAP becomes part of the RCRA permit. Therefore when your permit (including the RAP portion) is modified, revoked and reissued, terminated or when it expires, it will be modified according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.40 through 270.42, revoked and reissued according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.41 and 270.43, terminated according to the applicable requirements in § 270.43, and expire according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.50 and 270.51.</P>

                <P>In your RAP, the Director must specify, either directly or by reference, procedures for future modifications, revocations and reissuance, or terminations of your RAP. These procedures must provide adequate opportunities for public review and comment on any modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination that would significantly change your management of your remediation waste, or that otherwise merits public review and comment. If your RAP has been incorporated into a traditional RCRA permit, as allowed under § 270.85(c), then the RAP will be modified according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.40 through 270.42, revoked and reissued according to the applicable requirements in §§ 270.41 and 270.43, or terminated according to the applicable requirements of § 270.43.</P>

If one or more of these reasons do not exist, then the Director will not modify your final RAP, except at your request. Reasons for modification are:</P>
                <P>(1) You made material and substantial alterations or additions to the activity that justify applying different conditions;</P>

                <P>(2) The Director finds new information that was not available at the time <PRTPAGE P="381"/>of RAP issuance and would have justified applying different RAP conditions at the time of issuance;</P>
                <P>(3) The standards or regulations on which the RAP was based have changed because of new or amended statutes, standards or regulations, or by judicial decision after the RAP was issued;</P>
                <P>(4) If your RAP includes any schedules of compliance, the Director may find reasons to modify your compliance schedule, such as an act of God, strike, flood, or materials shortage or other events over which you as the owner/operator have little or no control and for which there is no reasonably available remedy;</P>
                <P>(5) You are not in compliance with conditions of your RAP;</P>
                <P>(6) You failed in the application or during the RAP issuance process to disclose fully all relevant facts, or you misrepresented any relevant facts at the time;</P>
                <P>(7) The Director has determined that the activity authorized by your RAP endangers human health or the environment and can only be remedied by modifying; or</P>
                <P>(8) You have notified the Director (as required in the RAP under § 270.30(l)(3)) of a proposed transfer of a RAP.</P>
                <P>(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, when the Director reviews a RAP for a land disposal facility under § 270.195, he may modify the permit as necessary to assure that the facility continues to comply with the currently applicable requirements in parts 124, 260 through 266 and 270 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(c) The Director will not reevaluate the suitability of the facility location at the time of RAP modification unless new information or standards indicate that a threat to human health or the environment exists that was unknown when the RAP was issued.</P>

If one or more reasons do not exist, then the Director will not modify or revoke and reissue your final RAP, except at your request. Reasons for modification or revocation and reissuance are the same as the reasons listed for RAP modifications in § 270.175(a)(5) through (8) if the Director determines that revocation and reissuance of your RAP is appropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>How are time periods in the requirements in this subpart and my RAP computed?</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Any time period scheduled to begin on the occurrence of an act or event must begin on the day after the act or event. (For example, if your RAP specifies that you must close a staging pile within 180 days after the operating term for that staging pile expires, and the operating term expires on June 1, then June 2 counts as day one of your 180 days, and you would have to complete closure by November 28.)</P>
                <P>(b) Any time period scheduled to begin before the occurrence of an act or event must be computed so that the period ends on the day before the act or event. (For example, if you are transferring ownership or operational control of your site, and wish to transfer your RAP, the new owner or operator must submit a revised RAP application no later than 90 days before the scheduled change. Therefore, if you plan to change ownership on January 1, the new owner/operator must submit the revised RAP application no later than October 3, so that the 90th day would be December 31.)</P>

                <P>(c) If the final day of any time period falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the time period must be extended to the next working day. (For example, if you wish to appeal the Director's decision to modify your RAP, then you must petition the Environmental Appeals Board within 30 days after the Director has issued the final RAP decision. If the 30th day falls on Sunday, then you may submit your appeal by the Monday after. If the 30th day falls on July 4th, then you may submit your appeal by July 5th.)<PRTPAGE P="383"/>
                </P>
                <P>(d) Whenever a party or interested person has the right to or is required to act within a prescribed period after the service of notice or other paper upon him by mail, 3 days must be added to the prescribed term. (For example, if you wish to appeal the Director's decision to modify your RAP, then you must petition the Environmental Appeals Board within 30 days after the Director has issued the final RAP decision. However, if the Director notifies you of his decision by mail, then you may have 33 days to petition the Environmental Appeals Board.)</P>

                <P>(a) If you wish to transfer your RAP to a new owner or operator, you must follow the requirements specified in your RAP for RAP modification to identify the new owner or operator, and incorporate any other necessary requirements. These modifications do not constitute “significant” modifications for purposes of § 270.170. The new owner/operator must submit a revised RAP application no later than 90 days before the scheduled change along with a written agreement containing a specific date for transfer of RAP responsibility between you and the new permittees.</P>
                <P>(b) When a transfer of ownership or operational control occurs, you as the old owner or operator must comply with the applicable requirements in part 264, subpart H (Financial Requirements), of this chapter until the new owner or operator has demonstrated that he is complying with the requirements in that subpart. The new owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with part 264, subpart H, of this chapter within six months of the date of the change in ownership or operational control of the facility or remediation waste management site. When the new owner/operator demonstrates compliance with part 264, subpart H, of this chapter to the Director, the Director will notify you that you no longer need to comply with part 264, subpart H, of this chapter as of the date of demonstration.</P>

                <P>(a) You may request a RAP for remediation waste management activities at a location removed from the area where the remediation wastes originated if you believe such a location would be more protective than the contaminated area or areas in close proximity.</P>
                <P>(b) If the Director determines that an alternative location, removed from the area where the remediation waste originated, is more protective than managing remediation waste at the area of contamination or areas in close proximity, then the Director may approve a RAP for this alternative location.</P>
                <P>(c) You must request the RAP, and the Director will approve or deny the RAP, according to the procedures and requirements in this subpart.</P>
                <P>(d) A RAP for an alternative location must also meet the following requirements, which the Director must include in the RAP for such locations:</P>

                <P>(1) The RAP for the alternative location must be issued to the person responsible for the cleanup from which the remediation wastes originated;<PRTPAGE P="384"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The RAP is subject to the expanded public participation requirements in §§ 124.31, 124.32, and 124.33 of this chapter;</P>
                <P>(3) The RAP is subject to the public notice requirements in § 124.10(c) of this chapter;</P>

                <P>(4) The site permitted in the RAP may not be located within 61 meters or 200 feet of a fault which has had displacement in the Holocene time (you must demonstrate compliance with this standard through the requirements in § 270.14(b)(11)) (See definitions of terms in § 264.18(a) of this chapter);

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart specifies the procedures EPA will follow in approving, revising, and withdrawing approval of State programs and the requirements State programs must meet to be approved by the Administrator under sections 3006(b), (f) and (h) of RCRA.</P>
              <P>(b) State submissions for program approval must be made in accordance with the procedures set out in this subpart.</P>

              <P>(c) The substantive provisions which must be included in State programs for them to be approved include requirements for permitting, compliance evaluation, enforcement, public participation, and sharing of information. Many of the requirements for State programs are made applicable to States by cross-referencing other EPA regulations. In particular, many of the provisions of <PRTPAGE P="392"/>parts 270 and 124 are made applicable to States by the references contained in § 271.14.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon receipt of a complete submission, EPA will conduct a public hearing, if interest is shown, and determine whether to approve or disapprove the program taking into consideration the requirements of this subpart, the Act and any comments received.</P>
              <P>(e) The Administrator shall approve State programs which conform to the applicable requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f) Except as provided in § 271.3(a)(3), upon approval of a State permitting program, the Administrator shall suspend the issuance of Federal permits for those activities subject to the approved State program.</P>
              <P>(g) Any State program approved by the Administrator shall at all times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(h) Partial State programs are not allowed for programs operating under RCRA final authorization. However, in many cases States will lack authority to regulate activities on Indian lands. This lack of authority does not impair a State's ability to obtain full program approval in accordance with this subpart, i.e., inability of a State to regulate activities on Indian lands does not constitute a partial program. EPA will administer the program on Indian lands if the State does not seek this authority.

              <P>(i) Except as provided in § 271.4, nothing in this subpart precludes a State from:</P>
              <P>(1) Adopting or enforcing requirements which are more stringent or more extensive than those required under this subpart;</P>
              <P>(2) Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this subpart. Where an approved State program has a greater scope of coverage than required by Federal law, the additional coverage is not part of the Federally approved program.</P>
              <P>(j) Requirements and prohibitions which are applicable to the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste and which are imposed pursuant to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) include any requirement or prohibition which has taken effect under HSWA, such as:</P>
              <P>(1) All regulations specified in Table 1, and</P>

              <P>(2) The self-implementing statutory provisions specified in Table 2 that have taken effect.

              <SUBJECT>Availability of final authorization.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Where a State program meets the requirements of section 3006 of RCRA and this subpart it may receive authorization for any provision of its program corresponding to a Federal provision in effect on the date of the State's authorization.</P>
              <P>(b) States approved under this subpart are authorized to administer and enforce their hazardous waste program in lieu of the Federal program, except as provided below:</P>
              <P>(1) Any requirement or prohibition which is applicable to the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste and which is imposed pursuant to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 takes effect in each State having a finally authorized State program on the same date as such requirement takes effect in other States. These requirements and prohibitions are identified in § 271.1(j).</P>
              <P>(2) The requirements and prohibitions in § 271.1(j) supersede any less stringent provision of a State program. The Administrator is authorized to carry out each such Federal requirement and prohibition in an authorized State except where, pursuant to section 3006(b) or 3006(g)(2) of RCRA, the State has received final or interim authorization to carry out the particular requirement or prohibition. Violations of Federal requirements and prohibitions effective in authorized States are enforceable under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.</P>
              <P>(3) Until an authorized State program is revised to reflect the amendments made by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 and such program revisions receive final or interim authorization pursuant to section 3006(b) or 3006(g)(2) of RCRA, the Administrator shall have the authority in such State to issue or deny permits or those portions of permits affected by the requirements and prohibitions established by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984.</P>
              <P>(4) Any requirement imposed under the authority of the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act:</P>

              <P>(i) Shall take effect in each State having a finally authorized State program on the same date as such requirement takes effect in other States;<PRTPAGE P="398"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Shall supersede any less stringent or inconsistent provision of a State program; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Shall be carried out by the Administrator in an authorized state except where, pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, the State has received final authorization to carry out the requirement in lieu of the Administrator.</P>
              <P>(c) Official State applications for final authorization may be reviewed on the basis of Federal self-implementing statutory provisions that were in effect 12 months prior to the State's submission of its official application (if no implementing regulations have previously been promulgated) and the regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260-266, 268, 270 and 271 that were in effect 12 months prior to the State's submission of its official application. To meet this requirement the State may demonstrate that its program qualifies for final authorization pursuant to this subpart or interim authorization under § 271.24. States are not precluded from seeking authorization for requirements taking effect less than 12 months prior to the State's submittal of its final application.</P>

              <P>(b) Any aspect of State law or of the State program which has no basis in human health or environmental protection and which acts as a prohibition on the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste in the State may be deemed inconsistent.</P>
              <P>(c) If the state manifest system does not meet the requirements of this part, the state program shall be deemed inconsistent. The state manifest system must further allow the use and recognize the validity of electronic manifests as described in § 260.10 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(5) Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations, including those governing State administrative procedures; and</P>
              <P>(6) The showing required by § 271.20(c) of the State's public participation activities prior to program submission.</P>

              <P>(b) Within 30 days of receipt by EPA of a State program submission, EPA will notify the State whether its submission is complete. If EPA finds that a State's submission is complete, the statutory review period (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the period of time allotted for formal EPA review of a proposed State program under section 3006(b) of the Act) shall be deemed to have begun on the date of receipt of the State's submission. If EPA finds that a State's submission is incomplete, the review period shall not begin until all necessary information is received by EPA.</P>

              <P>(c) If the State's submission is materially changed during the review period, the review period shall begin <PRTPAGE P="399"/>again upon receipt of the revised submission.</P>

              <P>(a) A description in narrative form of the scope, structure, coverage and processes of the State program.</P>
              <P>(b) A description (including organization charts) of the organization and structure of the State agency or agencies which will have responsibility for administering the program, including the information listed below. If more than one agency is responsible for administration of a program, each agency must have statewide jurisdiction over a class of activities. The responsibilities of each agency must be delineated, their procedures for coordination set forth, and an agency must be designated as a “lead agency” to facilitate communications between EPA and the State agencies having program responsibilities. When the State proposes to administer a program of greater scope of coverage than is required by Federal law, the information provided under this paragraph shall indicate the resources dedicated to administering the Federally required portion of the program.</P>
              <P>(1) A description of the State agency staff who will carry out the State program, including the number, occupations, and general duties of the employees. The State need not submit complete job descriptions for every employee carrying out the State program.</P>
              <P>(2) An itemization of the estimated costs of establishing and administering the program, including cost of the personnel listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, cost of administrative support, and cost of technical support. This estimate must cover the first two years after program approval.</P>
              <P>(3) An itemization of the sources and amounts of funding, including an estimate of Federal grant money, available to the State Director to meet the costs listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, identifying any restrictions or limitations upon this funding. This estimate must cover the first two years after program approval.</P>
              <P>(c) A description of applicable State procedures, including permitting procedures and any State administrative or judicial review procedures.</P>
              <P>(d) Copies of the permit form(s), application form(s), and reporting form(s) the State intends to employ in its program. Forms used by the State for hazardous waste management need not be identical to the forms used by EPA but should require the same basic information, except that the State RCRA program must require the use of EPA Manifest Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A. Where the State preprints information on the Manifest forms, such forms must be submitted with the State's application for approval. Restrictions on preprinting by the States are identified in 40 CFR 271.10(h). Otherwise, the State need not provide copies of uniform national forms it intends to use but should note its intention to use such forms.</P>
              <P>(e) A complete description of the State's compliance tracking and enforcement program.</P>
              <P>(f) A description of the State manifest tracking system, and of the procedures the State will use to coordinate information with other approved State programs and the Federal program regarding interstate and international shipments.</P>
              <P>(g) An estimate of the number of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Generators;</P>
              <P>(2) Transporters; and</P>
              <P>(3) On- and off-site storage, treatment and disposal facilities, and a brief description of the types of facilities and an indication of the permit status of these facilities.</P>
              <P>(h) If available, an estimate of the annual quantities of hazardous wastes generated within the State; transported into and out of the State; and stored, treated, or disposed of within the State: On-site; and Off-site.</P>

              <P>(a) Any State that seeks to administer a program under this subpart shall submit a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The Memorandum of Agreement shall be executed by the State Director and the Regional Administrator and shall become effective when approved by the Administrator. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the Memorandum of Agreement may include other terms, conditions, or agreements consistent with this subpart and relevant to the administration and enforcement of the State's regulatory program. The Administrator shall not approve any Memorandum of Agreement which contains provisions which restrict EPA's statutory oversight responsibility.</P>
              <P>(b) All Memoranda of Agreement shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Provisions for the Regional Administrator to promptly forward to the State Director information obtained prior to program approval in notifications provided under section 3010(a) of RCRA. The Regional Administrator and the State Director shall agree on procedures for the assignment of EPA identification numbers for new generators, transporters, treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.</P>
              <P>(2) Provisions specifying the frequency and content of reports, documents and other information which the State is required to submit to EPA. The State shall allow EPA to routinely review State records, reports, and files relevant to the administration and enforcement of the approved program. State reports may be combined with grant reports where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) Provisions on the State's compliance monitoring and enforcement program, including:</P>
              <P>(i) Provisions for coordination of compliance monitoring activities by the State and by EPA. These may specify the basis on which the Regional Administrator will select facilities or activities within the State for EPA inspection. The Regional Administrator will normally notify the State at least 7 days before any such inspection; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Procedures to assure coordination of enforcement activities.</P>
              <P>(4) Provisions allowing EPA to conduct compliance inspections of all generators, transporters, and HWM facilities in each year for which the State is operating under final authorization. The Regional Administrator and the State Director may agree to limitations on compliance inspections of generators, transporters, and non-major HWM facilities.</P>

              <P>(5) No limitations on EPA compliance inspections of generators, transporters, or non-major HWM facilities under paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall restrict EPA's right to inspect any generator, transporter, or HWM facility which it has cause to believe is not in compliance with RCRA; however, before conducting such an inspection, EPA will normally allow the <PRTPAGE P="401"/>State a reasonable opportunity to conduct a compliance evaluation inspection.</P>

              <P>(6) Provisions for the prompt transfer from EPA to the State of pending permit applications and any other information relevant to program operation not already in the possession of the State Director (e.g., support files for permit issuance, compliance reports, etc.). When existing permits are transferred from EPA to the State for administration, the Memorandum of Agreement shall contain provisions specifying a procedure for transferring the administration of these permits. If a State lacks the authority to directly administer permits issued by the Federal government, a procedure may be established to transfer responsibility for these permits.

              <P>(1) Use a manifest system that ensures that interstate and intrastate shipments of hazardous waste are designated for delivery and, in the case of intrastate shipments, are delivered to facilities that are authorized to operate under an approved state program or the federal program. The manifest system must require the use of the paper or electronic manifest formats as required by § 262.20(a) of this chapter. No other manifest form, electronic manifest format, shipping paper, or information other than that required by federal requirements, may be required by the state to travel with the shipment, or to be transmitted electronically, as a means to track the transportation and delivery of hazardous waste shipments. No other electronic signature other than that required by the federal electronic manifest requirements may be required by a state to be executed in connection with the signing of an electronic manifest.</P>
              <P>(2) Initiate the manifest and designate on the manifest the treatment, storage or disposal facility to which the waste is to be shipped.</P>
              <P>(3) Ensure that all wastes offered for transportation are accompanied by a manifest form, or are tracked with an electronic manifest, except:</P>
              <P>(i) Shipments subject to 40 CFR 262.20(e) or (f);</P>
              <P>(ii) Shipments by rail or water, as specified in 40 CFR 262.23(c) and (d).</P>

              <P>(g) In the case of interstate shipments for which the manifest has not been returned, the State program must provide for notification to the State in which the facility designated on the manifest is located and to the State in which the shipment may have been delivered (or to EPA in the case of unauthorized States).</P>
              <P>(h) The state must follow the federal manifest format for the paper manifest forms (EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A) and their instructions and must follow the federal electronic manifest format and instructions as obtained from the Electronic Manifest System described in § 260.10 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(1) A state may require the entry of waste codes associated with particular wastes that are regulated as hazardous wastes by the state, if the state codes <PRTPAGE P="403"/>are not redundant with a federally required code for the same waste. No state, however, may impose enforcement sanctions on a transporter during transportation of the shipment for failure of the form to include a state-required waste code.</P>
              <P>(2) Either the State to which a shipment is manifested (consignment State) or the State in which the generator is located (generator State), or both, may require that copies of the manifest form be submitted to the State.</P>

              <P>(b) The State shall have authority to require and shall require all transporters to comply with reporting and recordkeeping requirements equivalent to those under 40 CFR 263.22. States must require that transporters keep these records at least 3 years. States that choose to receive electronic documents must include the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3—(Electronic reporting) in their Program (except that states that choose to receive electronic manifests and/or permit the use of electronic manifests must comply with any applicable requirements for e-manifest in this section of this section).</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The state must require the transporter to carry the manifest forms (EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A) during transport, or, where the electronic manifest is used and the U. S. Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Regulations, 49 CFR parts 171-180, require a paper shipping document on the transport vehicle, to carry one printed copy of the electronic manifest during transport, except in the case of shipments by rail or water, for which transporters may carry a shipping paper as specified in 40 CFR 263.20(e) and (f).</P>
              <P>(2) The State must require the transporter to deliver waste only to the facility designated on the manifest, which in the case of return shipments of rejected wastes or regulated container residues, may also include the original generator of the waste shipment.</P>
              <P>(3) The State program must provide requirements for shipments by rail or water equivalent to those under 40 CFR 263.20(e) and (f).</P>

              <P>(4) For exports of hazardous waste, the state must require the transporter to refuse to accept hazardous waste for export if the exporter has not provided: A manifest listing the consent numbers for the hazardous waste shipment; a movement document for shipments occurring under consents issued by EPA on or after December 31, 2016; and on or after the AES filing compliance date, the ITN number for the hazardous waste shipment.

              <P>(d) For hazardous wastes that are discharged in transit, the State program must require that transporters notify <PRTPAGE P="404"/>appropriate State, local, and Federal agencies of such discharges, and clean up such wastes, or take action so that such wastes do not present a hazard to human health or the environment. These requirements shall be equivalent to those found at 40 CFR 263.30 and 263.31.</P>
              <P>(e) Unless otherwise provided in part 271, the State program shall have standards for transporters which are at least as stringent as any amendment to 40 CFR Part 263 which is promulgated after July 1, 1984.</P>

When State law authorizes such continued operation it shall require compliance by owners and operators of such facilities with standards at least as stringent as EPA's interim status standards at 40 CFR part 265.</P>
              <P>(b) The State must require all new HWM facilities to contact the State and obtain an EPA identification number before commencing treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste.</P>
              <P>(c) All permits issued by the State shall require compliance with the standards adopted by the State under § 271.12.</P>
              <P>(d) All permits issued under State law prior to the date of approval of final authorization shall be reviewed by the State Director and modified or revoked and reissued to require compliance with the requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(b) State programs shall have inspection and surveillance procedures to determine, independent of information <PRTPAGE P="406"/>supplied by regulated persons, compliance or noncompliance with applicable program requirements. The State shall maintain:</P>
              <P>(1) A program which is capable of making comprehensive surveys of all facilities and activities subject to the State Director's authority to identify persons subject to regulation who have failed to comply with permit application or other program requirements.

              </NOTE>
              
              <P>(2) To sue in courts of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any threatened or continuing violation of any program requirement, including permit conditions, without the necessity of a prior revocation of the permit;</P>
              <P>(3) To access or sue to recover in court civil penalties and to seek criminal remedies, including fines, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Civil penalties shall be recoverable for any program violation in at least the amount of $10,000 per day.</P>

              <P>(ii) Criminal remedies shall be obtainable against any person who knowingly transports any hazardous waste to an unpermitted facility; who treats, stores, or disposes of hazardous waste without a permit; who knowingly transports, treats, stores, disposes, recycles, causes to be transported, or otherwise handles any used oil regulated by EPA under section 3014 of RCRA that is not listed or identified as a hazardous waste under the state's hazardous waste program in violation of standards or regulations for management of such used oil; or who makes any false statement, or representation in any application, label, manifest, record, report, permit or other document filed, maintained, or used for purposes of program compliance (including compliance with any standards or regulations for used oil regulated by EPA under section 3014 of RCRA that is not listed or identified as hazardous waste). <PRTPAGE P="407"/>Criminal fines shall be recoverable in at least the amount of $10,000 per day for each violation, and imprisonment for at least six months shall be available.</P>

                <P>In addition to the requirements of this paragraph, the State may have other enforcement remedies. The following enforcement options, while not mandatory, are highly recommended:</P>
                <P>Procedures for assessment by the State of the costs of investigations, inspections, or monitoring surveys which lead to the establishment of violations;</P>
                <P>Procedures which enable the State to assess or to sue any persons responsible for unauthorized activities for any expenses incurred by the State in removing, correcting, or terminating any adverse effects upon human health and the environment resulting from the unauthorized activity, whether or not accidental;</P>
                <P>Procedures which enable the State to sue for compensation for any loss or destruction of wildlife, fish or aquatic life, or their habitat, and for any other damages caused by unauthorized activity, either to the State or to any residents of the State who are directly aggrieved by the unauthorized activity, or both; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for revision of State programs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Either EPA or the approved State may initiate program revision. Program revision may be necessary when the controlling Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or supplemented. The State shall keep EPA fully informed of any proposed modifications to its basic statutory or regulatory authority, its forms, procedures, or priorities.</P>
              <P>(b) Revision of a State program shall be accomplished as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The State shall submit a modified program description, Attorney General's statement, Memorandum of Agreement, or such other documents as EPA determines to be necessary under the circumstances.</P>
              <P>(2) The Administrator shall approve or disapprove program revisions based on the requirements of this part and of the Act. In approving or disapproving program revisions, the Administrator shall follow the procedures of paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The procedures for an immediate final publication of the Administrator's decision are as follows:</P>

              <P>(A) In the <E T="04">Federal Register;</E>
              </P>
              <P>(B) In enough of the largest newspapers in the State to attract Statewide attention; and</P>
              <P>(C) By mailing to persons on the State agency mailing list and to any other persons whom the agency has reason to believe are interested.</P>
              <P>(ii) The public notice shall summarize the State program revision, indicate whether EPA intends to approve or disapprove the revision and provide for an opportunity to comment for a period of 30 days.</P>

              <P>(iii) Approval or disapproval of a State program revision shall become effective 60 days after the date of publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State revision discussed in the notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received the Administrator shall so notify the State and shall, within 60 days after the date <PRTPAGE P="411"/>of publication, publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> either:</P>
              <P>(A) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or</P>
              <P>(B) A notice containing a response to comments and which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.</P>
              <P>(4) The procedures for proposed and final publication of the Administrator's decision are as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The Administrator shall issue public notice of his proposed approval or disapproval of a State program revision:</P>
              <P>(A) In the <E T="04">Federal Register;</E>
              </P>
              <P>(B) In enough of the largest newspapers in the State to attract Statewide attention; and</P>
              <P>(C) By mailing to persons on the State agency mailing list and to any other persons whom the agency has reason to believe are interested.</P>
              <P>(ii) The public notice shall summarize the State program revision, indicate whether EPA intends to approve or disapprove the revision and provide for an opportunity to comment for a period of at least 30 days.</P>

              <P>(iii) A State program revision shall become effective when the Administrator's final approval is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) States with approved programs shall notify EPA whenever they propose to transfer all or part of any program from the approved State agency to any other State agency, and shall identify any new division of responsibilities among the agencies involved. The new agency is not authorized to administer the program until approved by the Administrator under paragraph (b) of this section. Organizational charts required under § 271.6(b) shall be revised and resubmitted.</P>
              <P>(d) Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that circumstances have changed with respect to a State program, he may request, and the State shall provide, a supplemental Attorney General's statement, program description, or such other documents or information as are necessary.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) As the Federal program changes, authorized State programs must be revised to remain in compliance with this subpart.</P>

              <P>(2) Federal program changes are defined for purposes of this section as promulgated amendments to 40 CFR parts 124, 270, 260-266, or 268 and any self-implementing statutory provisions (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, those taking effect without prior implementing regulations) which are listed as State program requirements in this subpart. States must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and must subsequently submit the modifications to EPA for approval.</P>
              <P>(i) For Federal program changes occurring before July 1, 1984, the State program must be modified within one year of the date of the Federal program change.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) (iii) and (iv) of this section, for Federal program changes occurring on or after July 1, 1984, the State program must be modified by July 1 of each year to reflect all changes to the Federal program occurring during the 12 months preceding the previous July 1. (For example, States must modify their programs by July 1, 1986 to reflect all changes from July 1, 1984 to June 30, 1985.)</P>
              <P>(iii) For Federal program changes identified in § 271.1(j) that occur between November 8, 1984 and June 30, 1987 (inclusive), the State program must be modified by July 1, 1989.</P>
              <P>(iv) For Federal program changes identified in § 271.1(j) that occur between July 1, 1987 and June 30, 1990 (inclusive), the State program must be modified by July 1, 1991.</P>
              <P>(v) States may have an additional year to modify their programs for those changes to the Federal program identified in paragraphs (e) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section which necessitate a State statutory amendment.</P>
              <P>(3) The deadlines in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (v) may be extended by the Regional Administrator upon an adequate demonstration by a State that it has made a good faith effort to meet these deadlines and that its legislative or rulemaking procedures render the State unable to do so. No such extension shall exceed six months.</P>

              <P>(4)(i) Within 30 days of the completion of the State program modification the State must submit to EPA a copy <PRTPAGE P="412"/>of the program change and a schedule indicating when the State intends to seek approval of the change. Such schedule shall not exceed the dates provided for in paragraph (e)(4)(ii).</P>
              <P>(ii) Within 60 days of the appropriate deadline in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, the State must submit to EPA the documentation described in paragraph (b) of this section to revise its program.</P>
              <P>(f) A State must modify its program to comply with any Federal program changes which occur prior to the day that final authorization is received, except for those changes that the State has already received authorization for pursuant to § 271.3(f). Such State program modifications must be completed and submitted by the deadlines specified in paragraph (e) of this section or by the date of final authorization, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) States that are unable to modify their programs by the deadlines in paragraph (e) may be placed on a schedule of compliance to adopt the program revision(s) provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The State has received an extension of the program modification deadline under paragraph (e)(3) and has made diligent efforts to revise its program during that period of time,</P>
              <P>(ii) The State has made progress in adopting the program modifications,</P>
              <P>(iii) The State submits a proposed timetable for the requisite regulatory and/or statutory revisions by the deadline granted under paragraph (e)(3),</P>
              <P>(iv) The schedule of compliance for program revisions does not exceed one year from the extended program modification deadline under paragraph (e)(3), and</P>
              <P>(v) The schedule of compliance is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If a State fails to comply with the schedule of compliance, the Administrator may initiate program withdrawal procedures pursuant to §§ 271.22 and 271.23.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Abbreviated authorization revisions.</E> This abbreviated procedure applies to State Program revisions for the Federal rulemakings listed in Table 1 of this section. The abbreviated procedures are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) An application for a revision of a State's program for the rulemakings listed in Table 1 of this section shall consist of:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement from the State that its laws and regulations provide authority that is equivalent to, and no less stringent than, the designated minor rules or parts of rules specified in Table 1 of this section, and which includes references to the specific statutes, administrative regulations and where appropriate, judicial decisions. State statutes and regulations cited in the statement shall be lawfully adopted at the time the statement is signed and fully effective by the time the program revisions are approved; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Copies of all applicable State statutes and regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 30 days of receipt by EPA of a State's application for final authorization to implement a rule specified in Table 1 of this section, if the Administrator determines that the application is not complete or contains errors, the Administrator shall notify the State. This notice will include a concise statement of the deficiencies which form the basis for this determination. The State will address all deficiencies and resubmit the application to EPA for review.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of this section an application is considered incomplete when:</P>
              <P>(i) Copies of applicable statutes or regulations were not included;</P>
              <P>(ii) The statutes or regulations relied on by the State to implement the program revisions are not lawfully adopted at the time the statement is signed or fully effective by the time the program revisions are approved;</P>
              <P>(iii) In the statement, the citations to the specific statutes, administrative regulations and where appropriate, judicial decisions are not included or incomplete; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The State is not authorized to implement the prerequisite RCRA rules as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) Within 60 days after receipt of a complete final application from a State for final authorization to implement a rule or rules specified in Table 1 of this section, the Administrator shall publish a notice of the decision to grant final authorization in accordance with the procedures for immediate final <PRTPAGE P="413"/>publication in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) To be eligible to use the procedure in this paragraph (h), a State must be authorized for the provisions which the rule listed in Table 1 to this section amends.</P>

              <P>The State shall have standards for used oil management which are equivalent to 40 CFR part 279. These standards shall include:</P>
              <P>(a) Standards for used oil generators which are equivalent to those under subpart C of part 279 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(b) Standards for used oil collection centers and aggregation points which are equivalent to those under subpart D of part 279 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(c) Standards for used oil transporters and transfer facilities which are equivalent to those under subpart E of part 279 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(d) Standards for used oil processors and re-refiners which are equivalent to those under subpart F of part 279 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(e) Standards for used oil burners who burn off-specification used oil for energy recovery which are equivalent to those under subpart G of part 279 of this chapter;</P>
              <P>(f) Standards for used oil fuel marketers which are equivalent to those under subpart H of part 279 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(g) Standards for use as a dust suppressant and disposal of used oil which are equivalent to those under subpart I of part 279 of this chapter. A State may petition (e.g., as part of its authorization petition submitted to EPA under § 271.5) EPA to allow the use of used oil (that is not mixed with hazardous waste and does not exhibit a characteristic other than ignitability) as a dust suppressant. The State must show that it has a program in place to prevent the use of used oil/hazardous waste mixtures or used oil exhibiting a characteristic other than ignitability as a dust suppressant. In addition, such programs must minimize the impacts of use as a dust suppressant on the environment.</P>

              <P>(h)(1) Unless otherwise provided in part 271, state programs shall have standards for the marketing and burning of used oil for energy recovery that are at least as stringent as the requirements and prohibitions that EPA adopted on November 29, in 40 CFR part 266, subpart E of this chapter. The part 279 of this chapter requirements <PRTPAGE P="417"/>specified in Table 1 (except those provisions identified in footnotes 1 and 2 of Table 1) are Federally enforceable in those states that have not adopted state requirements equivalent to 40 CFR part 279, subparts G and H of this chapter requirements and have not been authorized to enforce the state requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State authorization.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The State of Delaware is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6921 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Act Amendments of <PRTPAGE P="424"/>1984 (HSWA) (Pub. L. 98-616, November 8, 1984), 42 U.S.C. 6926 (c) and (g). The Federal program for which a State may receive authorization is defined in 40 CFR 271.9 through 271.17 and 271.21. The State's program, as administered by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this chapter. EPA's approval was effective on June 22, 1984, 48 FR 23837.</P>

              <P>(b) Delaware is not authorized to implement any HSWA requirement in lieu of EPA unless EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to do so in a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice granting Delaware authorization.</P>
              <P>(c) Delaware has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities, including conducting inspections under section 3007, 42 U.S.C. 6927, and taking enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003, 42 U.S.C. 6928, 6934 and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) Delaware must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Delaware must seek final authorization for all program revisions pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA pursuant to section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Delaware obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.401. If Delaware obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.402.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State authorization.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The State of Michigan is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6921 <E T="03">et seq.</E> subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) (Public Law 98-616, November 8, 1984), 42 U.S.C. 6926 (c) and (g). The Federal program for which a State may receive authorization is defined in 40 CFR part 271. The State's program, as administered by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this chapter. EPA's approval of Michigan's base program was effective on October 30, 1986 (see 51 FR 36804). EPA's approval of the revisions to Michigan's base program was effective on January 23, 1990 (see 54 FR 48608) and RCRA Cluster III authorization effective June 24, 1991 (see 56 FR 18517).</P>

              <P>(b) Michigan is authorized to implement certain HSWA requirements in lieu of EPA. EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to allow such action in a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice granting Michigan authorization and RCRA Cluster III authorization effective June 24, 1991 (see 56 FR 18517).</P>
              <P>(c) Michigan has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities under sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, 6928, 6934, and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) Michigan must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Michigan must seek final authorization for all program revisions, pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA, pursuant to section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Michigan obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.1151 of this subpart. If Michigan obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.1152.</P>

              <SUBJECT>State authorization.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The State of Missouri is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6921 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), (Pub. L. 98-616, Nov. 8, 1984), 42 U.S.C. 6926 (c) and (g)). The Federal program for which a State may receive authorization is defined in 40 CFR part 271. The State's program, as administered by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this Chapter. EPA's approval was effective on December 4, 1985 (50 FR 47740, November 20, 1985).</P>

              <P>(b) Missouri is not authorized to implement any HSWA requirements in lieu of EPA unless EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to allow such action in a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice granting Missouri authorization.</P>
              <P>(c) Missouri has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities under sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, 6928, 6934, and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.</P>

              <P>(d) Missouri must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Missouri must seek final authorization for all program revisions pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA pursuant to section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Missouri obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.1301 of this subpart. If <PRTPAGE P="438"/>Missouri obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provision will be listed in § 227.1302.</P>

However, EPA did not authorize the breaking and crushing of universal waste lamps. The Agency needs further analysis to determine if the breaking and crushing of universal waste lamps will be authorized as part of the State's authorized program.

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Statutes and regulations that are broader in scope.</E> The following statutory and regulatory provisions are broader in scope than the Federal program, are not part of the authorized program, are not incorporated by reference and are not federally enforceable:</P>
              <P>(i) Environmental Conservation Laws (ECL), 1997 Replacement Volume, as revised by the 2004 Cumulative Pocket Part: Sections 27-0301; 27-0303; 27-0305; 27-0307; 27-0909(5); 27-0923; 27-0925 and 27-0926.</P>
              <P>(ii) Environmental Conservation Laws (ECL), 1997 Replacement Volume, as revised by the 2006 Cumulative Pocket Part: Section 27-1109(6).</P>
              <P>(iii) The following New York provisions are broader in scope because the State implements a Household Hazardous Waste program, whereas the Federal program excludes household waste from regulation as hazardous waste at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1): Title 6, New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (6 NYCRR), as amended effective through September 5, 2006: Sections 370.2(b)(92) “Household hazardous waste”; 370.2(b)(93) “Household hazardous waste collection facility”; and 373-4.</P>
              <P>(iv) At 371.4(c), New York retains K064, K065, K066, K090 and K091 as hazardous wastes while EPA has removed them from the table at 40 CFR 261.32 and no longer regulates them as hazardous wastes (64 FR 56469; October 20, 1999).</P>

              <P>(v) In the following provisions of New York's hazardous waste regulations, the State cross-references Part 364 “Waste Transporter Permits” requirements, which sets forth transporter requirements regarding permit and financial liability requirements: 372.2(b)(5)(ii), 372.3(a)(1), 372.3(a)(4), 372.3(b)(6)(iv), 372.3(d)(3), 373-2.5(b)(3)(ii)(d) and (e), 373-1.7(h)(3), 373-3.5(b)(3)(ii)(d) and (e), 374-3.4(a)(2), and <PRTPAGE P="444"/>Appendix 30 Instructions for Generators/Item 8. These provisions referencing the Part 364 transporter permit and financial liability requirements are broader in scope than the Federal program.</P>
              <P>(vi) New York did not adopt an analog to 40 CFR 261.4(g) that excludes certain dredged materials from the State definition of hazardous waste. Instead, the State subjects these materials to full regulation as hazardous wastes.</P>
              <P>(vii) New York State regulations do not incorporate the Mineral Processing Secondary Materials Exclusion at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(17) and the related changes affecting 40 CFR 261.2(c)(3) and (c)(4)/Table, and 40 CFR 261.2(e)(1)(iii). Since New York did not adopt the exclusion at 40 CFR 261.4(a)(17) the State has a broader in scope program because the effect is to include materials that are not considered solid waste by EPA.</P>
              <P>(viii) The following New York provisions are broader in scope because they include requirements associated with the regulation of PCB waste as a state-only hazardous waste: 371.4(e), 372.1(e)(9), 373-1.1(d)(1)(x), 374-2.2(a)(9), 374-2.2(b) Table 1 and Footnote 2, 374-2.5(e)(4), 374-2.6(d)(4), 374-2.7(d)(4), 376.1(g)(1)(i), and 376.4(f). PCB wastes are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) at 40 CFR part 761 rather than under the Federal RCRA program.</P>
              <P>(ix) The New York provision at 373-1.4(c) is broader in scope because it includes siting certificate requirements which are not part of the Federal program.</P>
              <P>(x) The New York provision at 373-2.15(a)(2) is broader in scope because it subjects incinerators to not just limited portions of the State's Air regulations in the same manner as the Federal rules, but entire programs including air program-specific permits and registrations.</P>
              <P>(xi) The New York provisions at 374-2.5(a)(2) and 374-2.6(a)(2) cross-reference 360-14.1(a)(4), which sets forth transfer facility and processor/re-refiner requirements for these types of facilities co-located at hazardous waste management facilities. These provisions referencing the Part 360 requirements are broader in scope than the Federal program because section 360-14.1(a)(4) may require used oil transfer facilities and processors/re-refiners managing non-hazardous used oil to be subject to State-only Part 360 provisions including permit requirements. The Federal program does not have an analogous permitting requirement for these types of facilities.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Vacated Federal rule.</E> New York provisions at 371.1(e)(1)(xvi) and 371.4(i) are no longer considered to be part of New York's authorized program because the equivalent federal requirements were vacated by a federal court. The Federal Requirements ((Hazardous Waste Combustors; Revised Standards (HSWA) (40 CFR 261.4(a)(16) and 261.38 only) were published on June 19, 1998. The New York regulations were authorized on January 11, 2005 (effective March 14, 2005). The State's authorized program was subsequently codified in 40 CFR part 272 on March 26, 2007 (effective May 25, 2007). However, the corresponding Federal rules were later vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Cir. No. 98-1379; June 27, 2014). Consistent with the Court's vacatur, EPA issued a new final rule removing 40 CFR 261.4(a)(16) and 261.38 from the Federal CFR (published on April 8, 2015)</P>

              <P>(a) The State of Ohio is authorized to administer and enforce a hazardous waste management program in lieu of the Federal program under subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6291 <E T="03">et seq.</E>, subject to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) (Pub.

The State's program, as administered by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6926(b) and part 271 of this chapter. EPA's approval of Ohio's base RCRA program was effective on June 30, 1989 (see 54 FR 27173). EPA's approval of revisions to Ohio's base program was effective on June 7, 1991 (see 56 FR 14203) and August 19, 1991 (see 56 FR 28088).</P>

              <P>(b) Ohio is authorized to implement certain HSWA requirements in lieu of EPA. EPA has explicitly indicated its intent to allow much action in a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice granting Ohio authorization on June 7, 1991 (see 56 FR 14203) and August 19, 1991 (see 56 FR 28088).</P>
              <P>(c) Ohio has primary responsibility for enforcing its hazardous waste program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its enforcement authorities under Section 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, 6928, 6934, and 6973, as well as under other Federal laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) Ohio must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle C program, in accordance with section 3006(b) of RCRA and 40 CFR part 271, subpart A. Ohio must seek final authorization for all program revisions pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA but, on a temporary basis, may seek interim authorization for revisions required by HSWA pursuant to section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g). If Ohio obtains final authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(b), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in 272.1801 of this subpart. If Ohio in the future obtains interim authorization for the revised requirements pursuant to section 3006(g), the newly authorized provisions will be listed in § 272.1802.</P>

              <P>(ii) Texas has partially or fully adopted, but is not authorized to implement, the Federal rules that are listed in the table in this paragraph <PRTPAGE P="457"/>(c)(4)(ii). The EPA will continue to implement the Federal HSWA requirements for which Texas is not authorized until the State receives specific authorization for those requirements. The EPA will not enforce the non-HSWA Federal rules although they may be enforceable under State law. For those Federal rules that contain both HSWA and non-HSWA requirements, the EPA will enforce only the HSWA portions of the rules.</P>

              <P>(v) Utah Administrative Code revised as of February 15, 1996: Sections R315-2-14, R315-3-3(i)(1)&amp;(3), R315-3-11(a), (b) &amp; (f), R315-3-16(b), R315-3-23(b)(1) &amp; (2), R315-3-23(c) &amp; (d), R315-3-24(a) through R315-3-29, and R315-3-34.</P>
              <P>(vi) Utah Administrative Code revised as of May 15, 1996: Section R315-15-1.1(j) &amp; (k).</P>
              <P>(3) The following statutory and regulatory provisions are broader-in-scope than the Federal program, are not part of the authorized program, and are not incorporated by reference:</P>
              <P>(i) Utah Code Annotated, Volume 3A, 1998 Replacement and 1999 Supplement, Title 19: Sections 19-6-105(3), 19-6-113(5), 19-6-118, 19-6-120, and 19-6-121.</P>
              <P>(ii) Utah Administrative Code revised as of February 15, 1996. EPA considers Utah's listing of all P999 and some F999 wastes (specifically: nerve, military, and chemical agents) as more stringent than the Federal rule. To the extent that unused chemical agents, as produced, exhibit a hazardous waste reactivity characteristic, they are considered hazardous waste and, thus, are regulated under Federal rule. Utah's listing of these wastes enhances the degree of regulatory control regarding these wastes. EPA also considers Utah's rule as broader-in-scope than the federal rule for those F999 process wastes which do not exhibit a characteristic for hazardous waste and would not be regulated under Federal rule. R315-2-10(e)(1), 315-2-11(e) introductory paragraph and R315-2-11(e)(1) are broader-in-scope regarding these wastes.</P>
              <P>(iii) Utah Administrative Code, as of May 15, 1996: R315-15-7.1(d), R315-15-10, R315-15-11 with respect to used oil transfer and off-specification used oil burning facilities, and R315-15-12 through R315-15-15 except R315-15-13.5(d).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Unauthorized State provisions:</E> (i) Although the Federal rules listed in the following table have been adopted by the State and have been included in the materials incorporated by reference in paragraph (b)(1) of this Section, EPA has not authorized the State for these rules at this time. While they may be enforceable under State law, they are not enforceable under RCRA:</P>

              </P>
              <P>(i) Has not made a decision to discard (e.g., burn for energy recovery) the pesticide. Until such a decision is made, the pesticide does not meet the definition of “solid waste” under 40 CFR 261.2; thus the pesticide is not a hazardous waste and is not subject to hazardous waste requirements, including this part 273. This pesticide remains subject to the requirements of FIFRA; or</P>

              <P>(ii) Has made a decision to use a management option that, under 40 CFR 261.2, does not cause the pesticide to be a solid waste (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the selected option is use (other than use constituting disposal) or reuse (other than burning for energy recovery), or reclamation). Such a pesticide is not a solid waste and therefore is not a hazardous waste, and is not subject to the hazardous waste requirements including this part 273. This pesticide, including a recalled pesticide that is exported to a foreign destination for use or reuse, remains subject to the requirements of FIFRA.</P>
              <P>(2) Unused pesticide products described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the generator of the unused pesticide product has not decided to discard (e.g., burn for energy recovery) them. These pesticides remain subject to the requirements of FIFRA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Factors for petitions to include other wastes under 40 CFR part 273.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The waste or category of waste, as generated by a wide variety of generators, is listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter, or (if not listed) a proportion of the waste stream exhibits one or more characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter. (When a characteristic waste is added to the universal waste regulations of this part 273 by using a generic name to identify the waste category (e.g., batteries), the definition of universal waste in § 260.10 of this chapter and § 273.9 will be amended to include only the hazardous waste portion of the waste category (e.g., hazardous waste batteries).) Thus, only the portion of the waste stream that does exhibit one or more characteristics (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, is hazardous waste) is subject to the universal waste regulations of this part 273;</P>

              <P>(b) The waste or category of waste is not exclusive to a specific industry or group of industries, is commonly generated by a wide variety of types of establishments (including, for example, households, retail and commercial businesses, office complexes, very <PRTPAGE P="493"/>small quantity generators, small businesses, government organizations, as well as large industrial facilities);</P>
              <P>(c) The waste or category of waste is generated by a large number of generators (e.g., more than 1,000 nationally) and is frequently generated in relatively small quantities by each generator;</P>
              <P>(d) Systems to be used for collecting the waste or category of waste (including packaging, marking, and labeling practices) would ensure close stewardship of the waste;</P>
              <P>(e) The risk posed by the waste or category of waste during accumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other hazardous wastes, and specific management standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste management requirements appropriate to be added to 40 CFR 273.13, 273.33, and 273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would be protective of human health and the environment during accumulation and transport;</P>
              <P>(f) Regulation of the waste or category of waste under 40 CFR part 273 will increase the likelihood that the waste will be diverted from non-hazardous waste management systems (e.g., the municipal waste stream, non-hazardous industrial or commercial waste stream, municipal sewer or stormwater systems) to recycling, treatment, or disposal in compliance with Subtitle C of RCRA.</P>
              <P>(g) Regulation of the waste or category of waste under 40 CFR part 273 will improve implementation of and compliance with the hazardous waste regulatory program; and/or</P>
              <P>(h) Such other factors as may be appropriate.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This section identifies those materials which are subject to regulation as used oil under this part. This section also identifies some materials that are not subject to regulation as used oil under this part, and indicates whether these materials may be subject to regulation as hazardous waste under parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Used oil.</E> EPA presumes that used oil is to be recycled unless a used oil handler disposes of used oil, or sends used oil for disposal. Except as provided in § 279.11, the regulations of this part apply to used oil, and to materials identified in this section as being subject to regulation as used oil, whether or not the used oil or material exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste</E>—(1) <E T="03">Listed hazardous waste.</E> (i) Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter are subject to regulation as hazardous waste under parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter, rather than as used oil under this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Rebuttable presumption for used oil.</E> Used oil containing more than 1,000 ppm total halogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter. Persons may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter).</P>

              <P>(A) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling arrangement as described in § 279.24(c), to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or disposed.<PRTPAGE P="498"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Characteristic hazardous waste.</E> Mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that solely exhibit one or more of the hazardous waste characteristics identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter and mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste that is listed in subpart D solely because it exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart C are subject to:</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, regulation as hazardous waste under parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter rather than as used oil under this part, if the resultant mixture exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste identified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Except as specified in § 279.10(b)(2)(iii) regulation as used oil under this part, if the resultant mixture does not exhibit any characteristics of hazardous waste identified under subpart C of part 261 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Regulation as used oil under this part, if the mixture is of used oil and a waste which is hazardous solely because it exhibits the characteristic of ignitability (e.g., ignitable-only mineral spirits), provided that the resultant mixture does not exhibit the characteristic of ignitability under § 261.21 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Very small quantity generator hazardous waste.</E> Mixtures of used oil and very small quantity generator hazardous waste regulated under § 262.14 of this chapter are subject to regulation as used oil under this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil from which the used oil has been properly drained or removed to the extent possible such that no visible signs of free-flowing oil remain in or on the material:</P>
              <P>(i) Are not used oil and thus not subject to this part, and</P>
              <P>(ii) If applicable are subject to the hazardous waste regulations of parts 124, 260 through 266, 268, and 270 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) Materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil that are burned for energy recovery are subject to regulation as used oil under this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Used oil drained or removed from materials containing or otherwise contaminated with used oil is subject to regulation as used oil under this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Mixtures of used oil with products.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, mixtures of used oil and fuels or other fuel products are subject to regulation as used oil under this part.</P>
              <P>(2) Mixtures of used oil and diesel fuel mixed on-site by the generator of the used oil for use in the generator's own vehicles are not subject to this part once the used oil and diesel fuel have been mixed. Prior to mixing, the used oil is subject to the requirements of subpart C of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Materials derived from used oil.</E> (1) Materials that are reclaimed from used oil that are used beneficially and are not burned for energy recovery or used in a manner constituting disposal (e.g., re-refined lubricants) are:</P>
              <P>(i) Not used oil and thus are not subject to this part, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Not solid wastes and are thus not subject to the hazardous waste regulations of parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 of this chapter as provided in § 261.3(c)(2)(i) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) Materials produced from used oil that are burned for energy recovery (e.g., used oil fuels) are subject to regulation as used oil under this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, materials derived from used oil that are disposed of or used in a manner constituting disposal are:</P>
              <P>(i) Not used oil and thus are not subject to this part, and</P>

              <P>(ii) Are solid wastes and thus are subject to the hazardous waste regulations of parts 260 through 266, 268, 270, and 124 <PRTPAGE P="499"/>of this chapter if the materials are listed or identified as hazardous wastes.</P>
              <P>(4) Used oil re-refining distillation bottoms that are used as feedstock to manufacture asphalt products are not subject to this part.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Wastewater.</E> Wastewater, the discharge of which is subject to regulation under either section 402 or section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act (including wastewaters at facilities which have eliminated the discharge of wastewater), contaminated with <E T="03">de minimis</E> quantities of used oil are not subject to the requirements of this part. For purposes of this paragraph, <E T="03">“de minimis”</E> quantities of used oils are defined as small spills, leaks, or drippings from pumps, machinery, pipes, and other similar equipment during normal operations or small amounts of oil lost to the wastewater treatment system during washing or draining operations. This exception will not apply if the used oil is discarded as a result of abnormal manufacturing operations resulting in substantial leaks, spills, or other releases, or to used oil recovered from wastewaters.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Used oil introduced into crude oil pipelines or a petroleum refining facility.</E> (1) Used oil mixed with crude oil or natural gas liquids (e.g., in a production separator or crude oil stock tank) for insertion into a crude oil pipeline is exempt from the requirements of this part. The used oil is subject to the requirements of this part prior to the mixing of used oil with crude oil or natural gas liquids.</P>
              <P>(2) Mixtures of used oil and crude oil or natural gas liquids containing less than 1% used oil that are being stored or transported to a crude oil pipeline or petroleum refining facility for insertion into the refining process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Used oil that is inserted into the petroleum refining facility process before crude distillation or catalytic cracking without prior mixing with crude oil is exempt from the requirements of this part provided that the used oil constitutes less than 1% of the crude oil feed to any petroleum refining facility process unit at any given time. Prior to insertion into the petroleum refining facility process, the used oil is subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, used oil that is introduced into a petroleum refining facility process after crude distillation or catalytic cracking is exempt from the requirements of this part only if the used oil meets the specification of § 279.11. Prior to insertion into the petroleum refining facility process, the used oil is subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(5) Used oil that is incidentally captured by a hydrocarbon recovery system or wastewater treatment system as part of routine process operations at a petroleum refining facility and inserted into the petroleum refining facility process is exempt from the requirements of this part. This exemption does not extend to used oil which is intentionally introduced into a hydrocarbon recovery system (e.g., by pouring collected used oil into the waste water treatment system).</P>
              <P>(6) Tank bottoms from stock tanks containing exempt mixtures of used oil and crude oil or natural gas liquids are exempt from the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Used oil on vessels.</E> Used oil produced on vessels from normal shipboard operations is not subject to this part until it is transported ashore.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Used oil containing PCBs.</E> Used oil containing PCBs (as defined at 40 CFR 761.3) at any concentration less than 50 ppm is subject to the requirements of this part unless, because of dilution, it is regulated under 40 CFR part 761 as a used oil containing PCBs at 50 ppm or greater. PCB-containing used oil subject to the requirements of this part may also be subject to the prohibitions and requirements found at 40 CFR part 761, including § 761.20(d) and (e). Used oil containing PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater is not subject to the requirements of this part, but is subject to regulation under 40 CFR part 761. No person may avoid these <PRTPAGE P="500"/>provisions by diluting used oil containing PCBs, unless otherwise specifically provided for in this part or part 761 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Rebuttable presumption for used oil.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To ensure that used oil is not a hazardous waste under the rebuttable presumption of § 279.10(b)(1)(ii), the used oil transporter must determine whether the total halogen content of used oil being transported or stored at a transfer facility is above or below 1,000 ppm.</P>
              <P>(b) The transporter must make this determination by:</P>
              <P>(1) Testing the used oil; or</P>
              <P>(2) Applying knowledge of the halogen content of the used oil in light of the materials or processes used.</P>
              <P>(c) If the used oil contains greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter. The owner or operator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter).</P>

              <P>(1) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling arrangement as described in § 279.24(c), to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids <PRTPAGE P="506"/>are recycled in any other manner, or disposed.</P>
              <P>(2) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units if the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Record retention.</E> Records of analyses conducted or information used to comply with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must be maintained by the transporter for at least 3 years.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Emergency procedures.</E> (i) Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or the designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:</P>
              <P>(A) Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and</P>
              <P>(B) Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed.</P>
              <P>(ii) Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests and, if necessary, by chemical analyses.</P>
              <P>(iii) Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (e.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-offs from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions).</P>
              <P>(iv) If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, he must report his findings as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) If his assessment indicated that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, he must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. He must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and</P>
              <P>(B) He must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for the geographical area (in the applicable regional contingency plan under part 1510 of this title), or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number 800/424-8802). The report must include:</P>

              <P>(v) During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other used oil or hazardous waste at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operation, collecting and containing released used oil, and removing or isolating containers.</P>
              <P>(vi) If the facility stops operation in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(vii) Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for recycling, storing, or disposing of recovered used oil, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility.</P>
              <P>(viii) The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility:</P>
              <P>(A) No waste or used oil that may be incompatible with the released material is recycled, treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and</P>
              <P>(B) All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.</P>
              <P>(C) The owner or operator must notify the Regional Administrator, and appropriate State and local authorities that the facility is in compliance with paragraphs (b)(6)(viii)(A) and (B) of this section before operations are resumed in the affected area(s) of the facility.</P>

              <P>(ix) The owner or operator must note in the operating record the time, date and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, he must submit a written report on the <PRTPAGE P="512"/>incident to the Regional Administrator. The report must include:</P>

              <P>(a) To ensure that used oil managed at a processing/re-refining facility is not hazardous waste under the rebuttable presumption of § 279.10(b)(1)(ii), the owner or operator of a used oil processing/re-refining facility must determine whether the total halogen content of used oil managed at the facility is above or below 1,000 ppm.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner or operator must make this determination by:</P>
              <P>(1) Testing the used oil; or</P>
              <P>(2) Applying knowledge of the halogen content of the used oil in light of the materials or processes used.</P>
              <P>(c) If the used oil contains greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter. The owner or operator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(1) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling agreement, to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or disposed.</P>
              <P>(2) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Rebuttable presumption for used oil.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) To ensure that used oil managed at a used oil burner facility is not hazardous waste under the rebuttable presumption of § 279.10(b)(1)(ii), a used oil burner must determine whether the total halogen content of used oil managed at the facility is above or below 1,000 ppm.</P>
              <P>(b) The used oil burner must determine if the used oil contains above or below 1,000 ppm total halogens by:</P>
              <P>(1) Testing the used oil;</P>
              <P>(2) Applying knowledge of the halogen content of the used oil in light of the materials or processes used; or</P>

              <P>(3) If the used oil has been received from a processor/re-refiner subject to regulation under subpart F of this part, using information provided by the processor/re-refiner.<PRTPAGE P="517"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) If the used oil contains greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste listed in subpart D of part 261 of this chapter. The owner or operator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste (for example, by showing that the used oil does not contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in appendix VIII of part 261 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(1) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are processed, through a tolling arrangement as described in § 279.24(c), to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other manner, or disposed.</P>
              <P>(2) The rebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units where the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other than refrigeration units.</P>

              <P>(g) If the owner or operator fails to obtain alternate assurance within 150 days of finding that he or she no longer meets the requirements of the financial test based on the year-end financial statements, or within 30 days of notification by the Director of the implementing agency that he or she no longer meets the requirements of the financial test, the owner or operator must notify the Director of such failure within 10 days.</P>

              <P>(a) An owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of § 280.93 by obtaining a guarantee that conforms to the requirements of this section. The guarantor must be:</P>
              <P>(1) A firm that:</P>

              <P>(i) Possesses a controlling interest in the owner or operator;<PRTPAGE P="556"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Possesses a controlling interest in a firm described under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; or,</P>
              <P>(iii) Is controlled through stock ownership by a common parent firm that possesses a controlling interest in the owner or operator; or,</P>
              <P>(2) A firm engaged in a substantial business relationship with the owner or operator and issuing the guarantee as an act incident to that business relationship.</P>
              <P>(b) Within 120 days of the close of each financial reporting year the guarantor must demonstrate that it meets the financial test criteria of § 280.95 based on year-end financial statements for the latest completed financial reporting year by completing the letter from the chief financial officer described in § 280.95(d) and must deliver the letter to the owner or operator. If the guarantor fails to meet the requirements of the financial test at the end of any financial reporting year, within 120 days of the end of that financial reporting year the guarantor shall send by certified mail, before cancellation or nonrenewal of the guarantee, notice to the owner or operator. If the Director of the implementing agency notifies the guarantor that he no longer meets the requirements of the financial test of § 280.95(b) or (c) and (d), the guarantor must notify the owner or operator within 10 days of receiving such notification from the Director. In both cases, the guarantee will terminate no less than 120 days after the date the owner or operator receives the notification, as evidenced by the return receipt. The owner or operator must obtain alternative coverage as specified in § 280.114(e).</P>
              <P>(c) The guarantee must be worded as follows, except that instructions in brackets are to be replaced with the relevant information and the brackets deleted:</P>
              <P>  Guarantee</P>
              <P>Guarantee made this [date] by [name of guaranteeing entity], a business entity organized under the laws of the state of [name of state], herein referred to as guarantor, to [the state implementing agency] and to any and all third parties, and obligees, on behalf of [owner or operator] of [business address].</P>
              <P>  Recitals.</P>
              <P>(1) Guarantor meets or exceeds the financial test criteria of 40 CFR 280.95(b) or (c) and (d) and agrees to comply with the requirements for guarantors as specified in 40 CFR 280.96(b).</P>
              <P>(2) [Owner or operator] owns or operates the following underground storage tank(s) covered by this guarantee: [List the number of tanks at each facility and the name(s) and address(es) of the facility(ies) where the tanks are located. If more than one instrument is used to assure different tanks at any one facility, for each tank covered by this instrument, list the tank identification number provided in the notification submitted pursuant to 40 CFR 280.22 or the corresponding state requirement, and the name and address of the facility.] This guarantee satisfies 40 CFR part 280, subpart H requirements for assuring funding for [insert: “taking corrective action” and/or “compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by” either “sudden accidental releases” or “nonsudden accidental releases” or “accidental releases”; if coverage is different for different tanks or locations, indicate the type of coverage applicable to each tank or location] arising from operating the above-identified underground storage tank(s) in the amount of [insert dollar amount] per occurrence and [insert dollar amount] annual aggregate.</P>
              <P>(3) [Insert appropriate phrase: “On behalf of our subsidiary” (if guarantor is corporate parent of the owner or operator); “On behalf of our affiliate” (if guarantor is a related firm of the owner or operator); or “Incident to our business relationship with” (if guarantor is providing the guarantee as an incident to a substantial business relationship with owner or operator)] [owner or operator], guarantor guarantees to [implementing agency] and to any and all third parties that:</P>

              <P>In the event that [owner or operator] fails to provide alternative coverage within 60 days after receipt of a notice of cancellation of this guarantee and the [Director of the implementing agency] has determined or suspects that a release has occurred at an underground storage tank covered by this <PRTPAGE P="557"/>guarantee, the guarantor, upon instructions from the [Director], shall fund a standby trust fund in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 280.112, in an amount not to exceed the coverage limits specified above.</P>
              <P>In the event that the [Director] determines that [owner or operator] has failed to perform corrective action for releases arising out of the operation of the above-identified tank(s) in accordance with 40 CFR part 280, subpart F, the guarantor upon written instructions from the [Director] shall fund a standby trust in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 280.112, in an amount not to exceed the coverage limits specified above.</P>
              <P>If [owner or operator] fails to satisfy a judgment or award based on a determination of liability for bodily injury or property damage to third parties caused by [“sudden” and/or “nonsudden”] accidental releases arising from the operation of the above-identified tank(s), or fails to pay an amount agreed to in settlement of a claim arising from or alleged to arise from such injury or damage, the guarantor, upon written instructions from the [Director], shall fund a standby trust in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 280.112 to satisfy such judgment(s), award(s), or settlement agreement(s) up to the limits of coverage specified above.</P>
              <P>(4) Guarantor agrees that if, at the end of any fiscal year before cancellation of this guarantee, the guarantor fails to meet the financial test criteria of 40 CFR 280.95(b) or (c) and (d), guarantor shall send within 120 days of such failure, by certified mail, notice to [owner or operator]. The guarantee will terminate 120 days from the date of receipt of the notice by [owner or operator], as evidenced by the return receipt.</P>
              <P>(5) Guarantor agrees to notify [owner or operator] by certified mail of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code naming guarantor as debtor, within 10 days after commencement of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(6) Guarantor agrees to remain bound under this guarantee notwithstanding any modification or alteration of any obligation of [owner or operator] pursuant to 40 CFR part 280.</P>
              <P>(7) Guarantor agrees to remain bound under this guarantee for so long as [owner or operator] must comply with the applicable financial responsibility requirements of 40 CFR part 280, subpart H for the above-identified tank(s), except that guarantor may cancel this guarantee by sending notice by certified mail to [owner or operator], such cancellation to become effective no earlier than 120 days after receipt of such notice by [owner or operator], as evidenced by the return receipt.</P>

              <P>(d) The Regional Administrator will notify the state of his determination regarding the acceptability of the state's fund or other assurance in lieu of financial mechanisms specified in this subpart. Within 60 days after the Regional Administrator notifies a state that a state fund or other state assurance is acceptable, the state must provide to each owner or operator for which it is assuming financial responsibility a letter or certificate describing the nature of the state's assumption of responsibility. The letter or certificate from the state must include, or have attached to it, the following information: the facility's name and address and the amount of funds for corrective action and/or for compensating third parties that is assured by the state.

Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a dedicated fund may not be commingled with other funds or otherwise used in normal operations. A dedicated fund will be considered eligible if it meets one of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(a) The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance, or order to pay for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks and is funded for the full amount of coverage required under § 280.93, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanism(s) that provide the remaining coverage; or</P>
              <P>(b) The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance, or order as a contingency fund for general emergencies, including taking corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks, and is funded for five times the full amount of coverage required under § 280.93, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanism(s) that provide the remaining coverage. If the fund is funded for less than five times the amount of coverage required under § 280.93, the amount of financial responsibility demonstrated by the fund may not exceed one-fifth the amount in the fund; or</P>
              <P>(c) The fund is dedicated by state constitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance or order to pay for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks. A payment is made to the fund once every year for seven years until the fund is fully-funded.

              <P>(1) The local government owner or operator has available bonding authority, approved through voter referendum (if such approval is necessary prior to the issuance of bonds), for an amount equal to the difference between the required amount of coverage and the amount held in the dedicated fund. This bonding authority shall be available for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks; or<PRTPAGE P="584"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The local government owner or operator has a letter signed by the appropriate state attorney general stating that the use of the bonding authority will not increase the local government's debt beyond the legal debt ceilings established by the relevant state laws. The letter must also state that prior voter approval is not necessary before use of the bonding authority.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Participation in management.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The term “participating in the management of an UST or UST system” means that, subsequent to the effective date of this subpart, December 6, 1995, the holder is engaging in decisionmaking control of, or activities related to, operation of the UST or UST system, as defined herein.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Actions that are participation in management.</E> (1) Participation in the management of an UST or UST system means, for purposes of this subpart, actual participation by the holder in the management or control of decisionmaking related to the operation of an UST or UST system. Participation in management does not include the mere capacity or ability to influence or the unexercised right to control UST or UST system operations. A holder is participating in the management of the UST or UST system only if the holder either:</P>
              <P>(i) Exercises decisionmaking control over the operational (as opposed to financial or administrative) aspects of the UST or UST system, such that the holder has undertaken responsibility for all or substantially all of the management of the UST or UST system; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Exercises control at a level comparable to that of a manager of the borrower's enterprise, such that the holder has assumed or manifested responsibility for the overall management of the enterprise encompassing the day-to-day decisionmaking of the enterprise with respect to all, or substantially all, of the operational (as opposed to financial or administrative) aspects of the enterprise.</P>
              <P>(2) Operational aspects of the enterprise relate to the use, storage, filling, or dispensing of petroleum contained in an UST or UST system, and include functions such as that of a facility or plant manager, operations manager, chief operating officer, or chief executive officer. Financial or administrative aspects include functions such as that of a credit manager, accounts payable/receivable manager, personnel manager, controller, chief financial officer, or similar functions. Operational aspects of the enterprise do not include the financial or administrative aspects of the enterprise, or actions associated with environmental compliance, or actions undertaken voluntarily to protect the environment in accordance with applicable requirements in this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Actions that are not participation in management pre-foreclosure.</E> (1) <E T="03">Actions at the inception of the loan or other transaction.</E> No act or omission prior to the time that indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest constitutes evidence of participation in management within the meaning of this subpart. A prospective holder who undertakes or requires an environmental investigation (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit) of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located (in which indicia of ownership are to be held), or requires a prospective borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system or to comply or come into compliance (whether prior or subsequent to the time that indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest) with any <PRTPAGE P="591"/>applicable law or regulation, is not by such action considered to be participating in the management of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Loan policing and work out.</E> Actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest do not constitute participation in management for purposes of this subpart. The authority for the holder to take such actions may, but need not, be contained in contractual or other documents specifying requirements for financial, environmental, and other warranties, covenants, conditions, representations or promises from the borrower. Loan policing and work out activities cover and include all such activities up to foreclosure, exclusive of any activities that constitute participation in management.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Policing the security interest or loan.</E> (A) A holder who engages in policing activities prior to foreclosure will remain within the exemption provided that the holder does not together with other actions participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in § 280.210(a). Such policing actions include, but are not limited to, requiring the borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system during the term of the security interest; requiring the borrower to comply or come into compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental and other laws, rules, and regulations during the term of the security interest; securing or exercising authority to monitor or inspect the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located (including on-site inspections) in which indicia of ownership are maintained, or the borrower's business or financial condition during the term of the security interest; or taking other actions to adequately police the loan or security interest (such as requiring a borrower to comply with any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower).</P>
              <P>(B) Policing activities also include undertaking by the holder of UST environmental compliance actions and voluntary environmental actions taken in compliance with this part, provided that the holder does not otherwise participate in the management or daily operation of the UST or UST system as provided in § 280.210(a) and § 280.230. Such allowable actions include, but are not limited to, release detection and release reporting, release response and corrective action, temporary or permanent closure of an UST or UST system, UST upgrading or replacement, and maintenance of corrosion protection. A holder who undertakes these actions must do so in compliance with the applicable requirements in this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281. A holder may directly oversee these environmental compliance actions and voluntary environmental actions, and directly hire contractors to perform the work, and is not by such action considered to be participating in the management of the UST or UST system.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Loan work out.</E> A holder who engages in work out activities prior to foreclosure will remain within the exemption provided that the holder does not together with other actions participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in § 280.210(a). For purposes of this rule, “work out” refers to those actions by which a holder, at any time prior to foreclosure, seeks to prevent, cure, or mitigate a default by the borrower or obligor; or to preserve, or prevent the diminution of, the value of the security. Work out activities include, but are not limited to, restructuring or renegotiating the terms of the security interest; requiring payment of additional rent or interest; exercising forbearance; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an assignment of accounts or other amounts owing to an obligor; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an escrow agreement pertaining to amounts owing to an obligor; providing specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions, counseling, or guidance; and exercising any right or remedy the holder is entitled to by law or under any warranties, covenants, <PRTPAGE P="592"/>conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower.</P>
              <P>(c) Foreclosure on an UST or UST system or facility or property on which an UST or UST system is located, and participation in management activities post-foreclosure.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Foreclosure.</E> (i) Indicia of ownership that are held primarily to protect a security interest include legal or equitable title or deed to real or personal property acquired through or incident to foreclosure. For purposes of this subpart, the term “foreclosure” means that legal, marketable or equitable title or deed has been issued, approved, and recorded, and that the holder has obtained access to the UST, UST system, UST facility, and property on which the UST or UST system is located, provided that the holder acted diligently to acquire marketable title or deed and to gain access to the UST, UST system, UST facility, and property on which the UST or UST system is located. The indicia of ownership held after foreclosure continue to be maintained primarily as protection for a security interest provided that the holder undertakes to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or otherwise divest itself of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, in a reasonably expeditious manner, using whatever commercially reasonable means are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, taking all facts and circumstances into consideration, and provided that the holder does not participate in management (as defined in § 280.210(a)) prior to or after foreclosure.</P>

              <P>(ii) For purposes of establishing that a holder is seeking to sell, re-lease pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or divest in a reasonably expeditious manner an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, the holder may use whatever commercially reasonable means as are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or may employ the means specified in § 280.210(c)(2). A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon a written <E T="03">bona fide,</E> firm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, as provided in § 280.210(c)(2), is not considered to hold indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest.</P>
              <P>(2) Holding foreclosed property for disposition and liquidation. A holder, who does not participate in management prior to or after foreclosure, may sell, re-lease, pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, liquidate, wind up operations, and take measures, prior to sale or other disposition, to preserve, protect, or prepare the secured UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located. A holder may also arrange for an existing or new operator to continue or initiate operation of the UST or UST system. The holder may conduct these activities without voiding the security interest exemption, subject to the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(i) A holder establishes that the ownership indicia maintained after foreclosure continue to be held primarily to protect a security interest by, within 12 months following foreclosure, listing the UST or UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, with a broker, dealer, or agent who deals with the type of property in question, or by advertising the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, as being for sale or disposition on at least a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or <PRTPAGE P="593"/>one suitable under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil procedure) covering the location of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located. For purposes of this provision, the 12-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date that the marketable title or deed has been issued, approved and recorded, and the holder has obtained access to the UST, UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later, provided that the holder acted diligently to acquire marketable title or deed and to obtain access to the UST, UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located. If the holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title or deed or to gain access to the UST or UST system, the 12-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date on which the holder first acquires either title to or possession of the secured UST or UST system, or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(ii) A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, establishes by such outbidding, rejection, or failure to act, that the ownership indicia in the secured UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located are not held primarily to protect the security interest, unless the holder is required, in order to avoid liability under federal or state law, to make a higher bid, to obtain a higher offer, or to seek or obtain an offer in a different manner.</P>
              <P>(A) Fair consideration, in the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a senior security interest in the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, is the value of the security interest as defined in this section. The value of the security interest includes all debt and costs incurred by the security interest holder, and is calculated as an amount equal to or in excess of the sum of the outstanding principal (or comparable amount in the case of a lease that constitutes a security interest) owed to the holder immediately preceding the acquisition of full title (or possession in the case of a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure, plus any unpaid interest, rent, or penalties (whether arising before or after foreclosure). The value of the security interest also includes all reasonable and necessary costs, fees, or other charges incurred by the holder incident to work out, foreclosure, retention, preserving, protecting, and preparing, prior to sale, the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, re-lease, pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), of an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, or other disposition. The value of the security interest also includes environmental investigation costs (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit of the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located), and corrective action costs incurred under §§ 280.51 through 280.67 or any other costs incurred as a result of reasonable efforts to comply with any other applicable federal, state or local law or regulation; less any amounts received by the holder in connection with any partial disposition of the property and any amounts paid by the borrower (if not already applied to the borrower's obligations) subsequent to the acquisition of full title (or possession in the case of a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure. In the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a junior security interest, fair consideration is the value of all outstanding higher priority security interests plus the value of the security interest held by the junior holder, each calculated as set forth in this paragraph (c).</P>

              <P>(B) Outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration means that the holder outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon within 90 days of receipt, a written, <E T="03">bona fide,</E> firm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or facility or property on <PRTPAGE P="594"/>which the UST or UST system is located received at any time after six months following foreclosure, as defined in § 280.210(c). A “written, <E T="03">bona fide,</E> firm offer” means a legally enforceable, commercially reasonable, cash offer solely for the foreclosed UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, including all material terms of the transaction, from a ready, willing, and able purchaser who demonstrates to the holder's satisfaction the ability to perform. For purposes of this provision, the six-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date that marketable title or deed has been issued, approved and recorded to the holder, and the holder has obtained access to the UST, UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later, provided that the holder was acting diligently to acquire marketable title or deed and to obtain access to the UST or UST system, UST facility and property on which the UST or UST system is located. If the holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title or deed or to gain access to the UST or UST system, the six-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date on which the holder first acquires either title to or possession of the secured UST or UST system, or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(3) Actions that are not participation in management post-foreclosure. A holder is not considered to be participating in the management of an UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located when undertaking actions under this part, provided that the holder does not otherwise participate in the management or daily operation of the UST or UST system as provided in § 280.210(a) and § 280.230. Such allowable actions include, but are not limited to, release detection and release reporting, release response and corrective action, temporary or permanent closure of an UST or UST system, UST upgrading or replacement, and maintenance of corrosion protection. A holder who undertakes these actions must do so in compliance with the applicable requirements in this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281. A holder may directly oversee these environmental compliance actions and voluntary environmental actions, and directly hire contractors to perform the work, and is not by such action considered to be participating in the management of the UST or UST system.</P>

              <P>(b) State submissions for program approval must be in accordance with the procedures set out in this part.</P>
              <P>(c) A state may apply for approval under this part at any time after the promulgation of release detection, prevention, and corrective action regulations under § 9003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.</P>
              <P>(d) Any state program approved by the Administrator under this part shall at all times be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">State program elements.</E> The following substantive elements of a state program must be addressed in a state application for approval:</P>
              <P>(1) Requirements for all existing and new underground storage tanks:</P>
              <P>(i) New UST systems (design, construction, installation, and notification);</P>
              <P>(ii) Upgrading of existing UST systems;</P>
              <P>(iii) General operating requirements;</P>
              <P>(iv) Release detection;</P>
              <P>(v) Release reporting, investigation, and confirmation;</P>
              <P>(vi) Out-of-service USTs and closure;</P>

              </P>
              <P>(viii) Financial responsibility for UST systems containing petroleum; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Operator training.</P>
              <P>(2) Provisions for adequate enforcement of compliance with the above program elements.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Final approval.</E> The state must demonstrate that its requirements under each state program element for existing and new UST systems are no less stringent than the corresponding federal requirements as set forth in subpart C of this part. The state must also demonstrate that it has a program that provides adequate enforcement of compliance with these requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) States with programs approved under this part are authorized to administer the state program in lieu of the federal program and will have primary enforcement responsibility with respect to the requirements of the approved program. EPA retains authority to take enforcement action in approved states as necessary and will notify the designated lead state agency of any such intended action.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 281.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Scope and definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) The Administrator may approve either partial or complete state programs. A “partial” state program regulates either solely UST systems containing petroleum or solely UST systems containing hazardous substances. If a “partial” state program is approved, EPA will administer the remaining part of the program. A “complete” state program regulates both petroleum and hazardous substance tanks.</P>
              <P>(2) EPA will administer the UST program in Indian country, except where Congress has clearly expressed an intention to grant a state authority to regulate petroleum and hazardous substance USTs in Indian country. In either case, this decision will not impair a state's ability to obtain program approval for petroleum or hazardous substances in non-Indian country in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Nothing in this subpart precludes a state from:</P>
              <P>(i) Adopting or enforcing requirements that are more stringent or more extensive than those required under this part; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Operating a program with a greater scope of coverage than that required under this part. Where an approved state program has a greater scope of coverage than required by federal law, the additional coverage is not part of the federally-approved program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) The definitions in 40 CFR part 280 apply to this entire part except as described below.</P>
              <P>(i) States may use the definitions associated with tank and piping secondary containment as defined in section 9003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) States may use the definitions associated with operator training as described in § 9010 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.</P>
              <P>(2) For the purposes of this part the term “final approval” means the approval received by a state program that meets the requirements in § 281.11(b).</P>

              <P>(2) If suction lines are used:</P>
              <P>(i) Tightness tests must be conducted at least once every three years, unless a monthly method of detection is applied to this piping; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The piping is designed to allow the contents of the pipe to drain back into the storage tank if the suction is released and is also designed to allow an inspector to immediately determine the integrity of the piping system.</P>
              <P>(3) Except as provided for in § 281.30(a)(1) new or replaced petroleum piping must use interstitial monitoring within secondary containment in accordance with section 9003(i)(1) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act except when the state requires evidence of financial responsibility and certification in accordance with section 9003(i)(2) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Requirements for hazardous substance UST systems.</E> All new hazardous substance UST systems must use interstitial monitoring within secondary containment of the tanks and the attached underground piping that conveys the regulated substance stored in the tank. For hazardous substance UST systems installed prior to October 13, 2015, owners and operators can use another form of release detection if the owner and operator can demonstrate to the state (or the state otherwise determines) that another method will detect a release of the regulated substance as effectively as other methods allowed under the state program for petroleum UST systems and that effective corrective action technology is available for the hazardous substance being stored that can be used to protect human health and the environment.</P>

              <P>(a) The following procedures are required for all applications, regardless of whether the application is for a partial or complete program, as defined in § 281.12.</P>
              <P>(b) Before submitting an application to EPA for approval of a state program, the state must provide an opportunity for public notice and comment in the development of its underground storage tank program.</P>
              <P>(c) When EPA receives a state program application, EPA will examine the application and notify the state whether its application is complete, in accordance with the application components required in § 281.20. The 180-day statutory review period begins only after EPA has determined that a complete application has been received.</P>
              <P>(d) The state and EPA may by mutual agreement extend the review period.</P>

              <P>(e) After receipt of a complete program application, the Administrator will tentatively determine approval or disapproval of the state program. EPA shall issue public notice of the tentative determination in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and other mechanisms to attract state-wide attention. Notice of the tentative determination must also:</P>
              <P>(1) Afford the public 30 days after the notice to comment on the state's application and the Administrator's tentative determination; and</P>
              <P>(2) Include a general statement of the areas of concern, if the Administrator indicates the state program may not be approved; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Revision of approved state programs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Either EPA or the approved state may initiate program revision. Program revision may be necessary when the controlling federal or state statutory or regulatory authority is changed or when responsibility for the state program is shifted to a new agency or agencies. The state must inform EPA of any proposed modifications to its basic statutory or regulatory authority or change in division of responsibility among state agencies. EPA will determine in each case whether a revision of the approved program is required. Approved state programs must submit a revised application within three years of any changes to this part that requires a program revision.</P>

              <P>(b) Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that circumstances have changed with respect to an approved state program or the federal <PRTPAGE P="619"/>program, the Administrator may request, and the state must provide, a revised application as prescribed by EPA.</P>
              <P>(c) The Administrator will approve or disapprove program revisions based on the requirements of this part and Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act pursuant to the procedures under this section, or under § 281.50 if EPA has reason to believe the proposed revision will receive significant negative comment from the public.</P>

              <P>(1) The Administrator must issue public notice of planned approval or disapproval of a state program revision in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and other mechanisms to attract state-wide attention. The public notice must summarize the state program revision, indicate whether EPA intends to approve or disapprove the revision, and provide for an opportunity to comment for a period of 30 days.</P>

              <P>(2) The Administrator's decision on the proposed revision becomes effective 60 days after the date of publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless significant negative comment opposing the proposed revision is received during the comment period. If significant negative comment is received, EPA must notify the state and within 60 days after the date of publication, publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> either:</P>
              <P>(i) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision, which will then be treated as a tentative decision in accordance with the applicable procedures of § 281.50(e) and (f); or</P>
              <P>(ii) A notice that contains a response to significant negative comments and affirms either that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.</P>

              <P>(1) The state must give EPA notice of the proposed transfer, and submit, at least 90 days before the transfer, a plan for the orderly transfer of all relevant program information necessary for EPA to administer the program.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 30 days of receiving the state's transfer plan, EPA must evaluate the plan and identify any additional information needed by the federal government for program administration.</P>

              <P>(3) At least 30 days before the transfer is to occur, EPA must publish notice of the transfer in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and other mechanisms to attract state-wide attention.</P>
              <P>(b) The following procedures apply when the Administrator considers withdrawing approval.</P>
              <P>(1) When EPA begins proceedings to determine whether to withdraw approval of a state program (either on its own initiative or in response to a petition from an interested person), withdrawal proceedings will be conducted in accordance with procedures set out in 40 CFR 271.23(b) and (c), except for § 271.23(b)(8)(iii) to the extent that it deviates from requirements under § 281.60.</P>
              <P>(2) If the state fails to take appropriate action within a reasonable time, not to exceed 120 days after notice from the Administrator that the state is not administering and enforcing its program in accordance with the requirements of this part, EPA will withdraw approval of the state's program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Colorado State-Administered Program.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The State of Colorado is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 <E T="03">et seq.</E> The State's program, as administered by the Colorado Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Division of Environmental Response and Remediation (DERR), was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this chapter. EPA <PRTPAGE P="625"/>published the notice of final determination approving the Colorado underground storage tank base program effective on April 23, 2007. A subsequent program revision application was approved by EPA and became effective on July 19, 2019.</P>
              <P>(b) Colorado has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection, and enforcement authorities under Sections 9003(h), 9005, and 9006 of Subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h),6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.</P>

              <P>(c) To retain program approval, Colorado must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with Section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Colorado obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to Section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart, and notice of any change will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
              <P>(d) Colorado has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to the EPA and approved effective April 23, 2007, and the program revision application approved by the EPA effective on July 19, 2019:</P>

              <P>(a) The State of Massachusetts is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the federal program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 <E T="03">et seq.</E> The State's program, as administered by the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety (now called the Massachusetts Department of Fire Services) and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR Part 281 EPA approved the Massachusetts program on March 3, 1995, which was effective on April 17, 1995.</P>

              <P>(b) Massachusetts has primary responsibility for enforcing its underground storage tank program.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">History of the approval of Oklahoma's Program.</E> The State of Oklahoma is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the federal program under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 <E T="03">et seq.</E> The <PRTPAGE P="651"/>State's program, as administered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commision, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and Part 281 of this Chapter. EPA published the notice of final determination approving the Oklahoma underground storage tank base program effective on October 14, 1992. A subsequent program revision application was approved effective on March 12, 2018.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Enforcement authority.</E> Oklahoma has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9003(h), 9005 and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h), 6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.</P>

              <P>(c) To retain program approval, Oklahoma must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the federal subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Oklahoma obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

              <P>(c) To retain program approval, the Commonwealth must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle I program that make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If the Commonwealth obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(d) The Commonwealth has final approval for the following elements submitted to EPA in the State's program application for final approval.

              <SUBJECT>Texas State-Administered Program.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The State of Texas is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the federal program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 <E T="03">et seq.</E> The State's program, as administered by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this Chapter. EPA approved the Texas program on March 7, 1995 and it was effective on April 17, 1995.</P>
              <P>(b) Texas has primary responsibility for enforcing its underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, as well as under other statutory and regulatory provisions.</P>

              <P>(c) To retain program approval, Texas must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the federal subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Texas obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(d) Texas has final approval for the following elements submitted to EPA in Texas' program application for final approval and approved by EPA on March 7, 1995. Copies may be obtained from the Underground Storage Tank Program, Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, P.O. Box 13087, Austin, TX 78711-3087.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">History of the approval of Utah's Program.</E> The State of Utah is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the federal program under subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 <E T="03">et seq.</E> The State's program, as administered by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Division of Environmental Response and Remediation (DERR), was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and Part 281 of this Chapter. EPA published the notice of final determination approving the Utah underground storage tank base program effective on April 7, 1995. A subsequent program revision application was approved by EPA and became effective on January 4, 2019.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Enforcement authority.</E> Utah has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its corrective action, inspection, and enforcement authorities under sections 9003(h), 9005, and 9006 of subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991b(h),6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.</P>

              <P>(c) To retain program approval, Utah must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the federal subtitle I program which make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Utah obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
              <P>(d) Utah has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to EPA and approved effective April 7, 1995, and the program revision application approved by EPA effective on January 4, 2019:</P>
