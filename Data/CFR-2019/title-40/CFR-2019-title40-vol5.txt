      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Where air quality models are used to meet the provisions of this section, modeling shall be based on the applicable models and other requirements specified in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix W (Guideline on Air Quality Models). Where an air quality model is inappropriate, the model may be modified or another model may be substituted only on a case-by-case basis at the Department's discretion upon written approval by the administrator of EPA. In addition, use of a modified or substituted model must be subject to notice and opportunity for public comment under procedures set forth in 40 CFR 51.102.”

              (j) EPA is approving Pennsylvania's request that the 1990 emissions inventory for VOCs from R.R. Donnelley & Sons—East Plant be corrected to accurately reflect the 1990 emissions. The 1990 baseyear VOC emissions inventory will be corrected to 864 tons. Justification for the change in VOC emissions is described as follows:
              (1) For rotogravure operations, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (East Plant) initially assumed a 5% retention of solvent in the web, and then revised their assumption to 2% based on the amount of solvent actually being recovered by the six bed carbon adsorption system. Based on VOC emissions data submitted to PADEP for the year 1990, the actual VOC emissions from rotogravure operations was 794.51 tons. The figures were taken from data submitted to PADEP from the facility dated May 6, 1996 (subsequently submitted to EPA from PADEP via letter dated December 13, 1996).
              (2) For heatset web offset lithographic operations, boilers, and associated solvent cleaning equipment, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company provided data calculating estimates for actual 1990 VOC emissions of 69.83 tons. The figures were taken from the facility's RACT proposal submitted to PADEP dated March 29, 1995.

              (k) Rockwell Heavy Vehicle, Inc., New Castle Forge Plant, Lawrence County—On April 8, 1998 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection requested that EPA include the CO, VOC and NOX emissions from this facility in the 1990 base year emission inventory. The CO, VOC and NOX emissions from the natural gas units and the spray booth of this facility are hereby approved as part of the 1990 point source inventory. The 1990 CO, VOC and NOX emissions from the natural gas units are 8.3 TPY, 1.2 TPY and 64.2 TPY, respectively. The 1990 VOC emissions from the spray booth is 12.1 TPY.

              (q) Determination of attainment—In accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, EPA has determined that Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard and that certain requirements of section 172(c) of the Clean Air Act are suspended as long as the nonattainment area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination is based upon complete, quality assured, and certified ambient air monitoring data that show the area has monitored attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the 2007 to 2009 monitoring period. Complete, quality-assured air monitoring data for 2010 are consistent with continued attainment. This determination suspends the obligation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to submit an attainment demonstration and associated reasonably available control measures (RACM), a reasonable further progress (RFP) plan, contingency measures, and other planning requirements related to attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the Pittsburgh Area for as long as the area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. If a violation of the1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.
              (r) Determination of attainment. EPA has determined, as of March 26, 2012, that based on 2008 to 2010 ambient air quality data, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
              (s) Determination of attainment. EPA has determined, as of April 4, 2013, that based on 2009 to 2011 ambient air quality data, the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley, PA moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
              (t) On July 14, 2012, Pennsylvania repealed the provisions set forth in Sections 130.101 through 130.108 pertaining to Portable Fuel Containers. Pennsylvania's regulations in the Pennsylvania State Implementation Plan were removed because they are superseded by more stringent Federal requirements codified at 40 CFR 59.600 through 59.699, relating to control of evaporative emissions from new and in-use portable fuel containers.

              (a) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Pennsylvania Implementation Plan, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation shall restrict the annual usage of asphalts to the limits listed below in the following sixteen county area of Pennsylvania: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Cambria, Clarion, Fayette, Green, Indiana, Jefferson, Lawrence, Mercer, Somerset, Venango, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties:
              (1) No more than twenty percent of the total amount of liquid bituminous asphalt paving material used shall be cutback asphalt; and
              (2) No more than 2,615,000 gallons of cutback asphalts shall be used, of which no more than 1,400,000 gallons may be used for dust palliative work on roadways and shoulders; and
              (3) No more than 2,500,000 gallons total of emulsion Class E-4 and Class E-5 shall be used unless an equivalent reduction in the use of cutbacks is made to balance the additional hydrocarbon emissions from emulsions.
              (b) The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is required to submit to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, on a quarterly basis, reports which list for each of the affected counties the number of gallons of each class of asphalt used. The first quarterly reports will be submitted in October 1977 for the period between July 1, 1977, and September 30, 1977. Copies of all reports will also be forwarded to Region III, EPA.

              (a) Determination of attainment. EPA has determined, as of December 29, 2014, based on quality-assured ambient air quality data for 2011 to 2013, that the Lyons, PA nonattainment area has attained the 2008 Pb NAAQS. This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2008 Pb NAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 2008 Pb NAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.
              (b) EPA approves the state implementation plan for the North Reading, Pennsylvania nonattainment area for the 2008 lead NAAQS. This SIP revision including reasonably available control measures, reasonably available control technology, contingency measures, and attainment demonstration was submitted by the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on August 10, 2015.
              (c) EPA approves the state implementation plan for the Lower Beaver Valley, Pennsylvania nonattainment area for the 2008 lead NAAQS. This SIP revision includes reasonably available control measures, reasonably available control technology, contingency measures, and an attainment demonstration submitted by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on January 15, 2015.

              (a) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2007 to 2009, EPA determined that the Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle (Harrisburg) fine particle (PM2.5) nonattainment area attained the 1997 annual PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of April 5, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 179(c) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Harrisburg PM2.5 nonattainment area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).

              (b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2007 to 2009, EPA determined that the Johnstown fine particle (PM2.5) nonattainment area attained the 1997 annual PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of April 5, 2010. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 179(c) to determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Johnstown PM2.5 nonattainment area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 179(d).

              (c) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2007 to 2009, EPA determined that the Lancaster fine particle (PM2.5) nonattainment area attained the 1997 annual PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of April 5, 2010.

                (q) Determination of attainment. EPA has determined, as of July 10, 2015, based on quality-assured ambient air quality data for 2012 to 2014, that the Liberty-Clairton, PA nonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour fine particle (PM2.5) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.

              (u) Determination of attainment. EPA has determined based on 2013 to 2015 ambient air quality monitoring data, that the Delaware County, Pennsylvania moderate nonattainment area has attained the 2012 annual fine particulate matter (PM2.5) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1015, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning state implementation plan revisions related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2012 annual PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (v) Determination of attainment. Effective June 9, 2017, the EPA has determined that, based on 2013 to 2015 ambient air quality data, the Liberty-Clairton, PA PM2.5 nonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of December 31, 2015. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 188(b)(2) to determine whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also has determined that the Liberty-Clairton, PA nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 188(b)(2).
              (w) Determination of Attainment. EPA has determined based on 2014 to 2016 ambient air quality monitoring data, that the Lebanon County, Pennsylvania moderate nonattainment area has attained the 2012 annual fine particulate matter (PM2.5) primary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1015, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning state implementation plan revisions related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2012 annual PM2.5 NAAQS.

              (a) Part D—Disapproval.
              (1) On November 5, 1985, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management submitted a revision to the Rhode Island State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkwright Incorporated. This revision is an alternative reasonably available control technology determination for the control of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from three paper coating lines at Arkwright Incorporated's Fiskeville, Rhode Island facility. As a result of EPA's disapproval of this revision, the existing VOC rules applicable to Arkwright Incorporated and contained in the Rhode Island SIP remain in effect (Rhode Island Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 19 as approved by EPA in 40 CFR 52.2080(c)(19)).

              Stack height review.

              The State of Rhode Island has declared to the satisfaction of EPA that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height credits greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited dispersion technique as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as revised on July 8, 1985. Such declarations were submitted to EPA on March 27, 1986. The State has further declared, in letters from Thomas D. Getz, dated October 15, 1985 and March 27, 1986, that “[R]hode Island will use the 8 July 1985 revised height regulations in administering section 9.18 of its new source review regulations.” Thus, Rhode Island has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

              Emission inventories.
              (a) The Governor's designee for the State of Rhode Island submitted the 1990 base year emission inventory for the Providence ozone nonattainment area on January 12, 1993 as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The 1990 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for this area.
              (b) The inventory is for the ozone precursors which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventory covers point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources.
              (c) The Providence nonattainment area is classified as serious and includes the entire state of Rhode Island.
              (d) Minor revisions to the Rhode Island 1990 base year emission inventory were submitted to EPA on September 21, 1998. The revised emission estimates were prepared in accordance with EPA guidance, and are approved into the State's SIP.
              (e) The state of Rhode Island submitted base year emission inventories representing emissions for calendar year 2002 from the Providence moderate ozone nonattainment area on April 30, 2008 as revisions to the State's SIP. The 2002 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for this area. The inventory consists of emission estimates of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, and cover point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile and biogenic sources. The inventory was submitted as a revision to the SIP in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 1997 8-hour ozone standard.

              Control strategy: Ozone.
              (a) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on September 21, 1998. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(c)(2)(B), and the contingency measure requirements of section 182(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act, for the Providence serious ozone nonattainment area.

              (b) Approval—Revisions to the state implementation plan submitted by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on March 24, 2003. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the one-hour ozone attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, for the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes a one-hour attainment date of November 15, 2007 for the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area, and approves the contingency measures for purposes of attainment. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2007 of 30.68 tons per day of volatile organic compounds and 33.97 tons per day of nitrogen oxides to be used in transportation conformity in the Rhode Island serious ozone nonattainment area. Rhode Island also commits to conduct a mid-course review to assess modeling and monitoring progress achieved towards the goal of attainment by 2007, and to submit the results to EPA by December 31, 2004.

              (c) Determination of Attainment. Effective July 6, 2010, EPA is determining that the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.
              (d) Determination of Attainment. Effective November 22, 2010, EPA is determining that the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard based on 2007-2009 monitoring data. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Providence (All of Rhode Island) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply. In addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 ozone standard.
              (e) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on April 30, 2008. The revision is for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b)(1) from 2002 through 2008, and the contingency measure requirement of sections 172(c)(9) and of the Clean Air Act, for the Providence moderate ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 of 24.64 tons per day of volatile organic compounds and 28.26 tons per day of nitrogen oxides to be used in transportation conformity in the Providence moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.

              § 52.2089
              Control strategy: carbon monoxide.
              (a) Approval—On September 22, 2008, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management submitted a request to establish a limited maintenance plan for the Providence Rhode Island carbon monoxide attainment area for the remainder of the second ten-year maintenance plan. The State of Rhode Island has committed to year round carbon monoxide monitoring at the East Providence Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Station (PAMS) site; re-establishing downtown Providence CO monitoring if criteria specified in the Limited Maintenance Plan are triggered; and, ensuring that project-level carbon monoxide evaluations of transportation projects in the maintenance area are conducted. The limited maintenance plan satisfies all applicable requirements of section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Approval of a limited maintenance plan is conditioned on maintaining levels of ambient carbon monoxide levels below the required limited maintenance plan 8-hour carbon monoxide design value criterion of 7.65 parts per million. If the Limited Maintenance Plan criterion is no longer satisfied, Rhode Island must develop a full maintenance plan to meet Clean Air Act requirements.

              § 52.2122
              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves South Carolina's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of part D, title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977.
              (b) EPA disapproved South Carolina's generic bubble regulation submitted for approval into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on June 5, 1985.
              (c)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (c), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
              (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:

              (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; or

              (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; and,
              (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:

              (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e; or

              (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more.
              (4) For purposes of this paragraph (c)—
              (i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
              (ii) The term tpy CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
              (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.

              (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO2e.

              (iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in South Carolina Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards (South Carolina Regulations) 61-62.5, Standard No. 7, paragraph (a)(2)(iv)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in South Carolina Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards (South Carolina Regulations) 61-62.5, Standard No. 7, paragraphs (b)(34) and (b)(49)(i)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO2e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO2e instead of applying the value in South Carolina Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards (South Carolina Regulations) 61-62.5, Standard No. 7, paragraph (b)(49)(ii).
              (d) Regulation 61-62.5 Standard No. 7—This regulation (submitted on July 1, 2005) includes two portions of EPA's 2002 NSR Reform Rules that were vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court—Pollution Control Projects (PCPs) and clean units. As a result, EPA is disapproving all rules and/or rule sections in the South Carolina PSD rules referencing clean units or PCPs. Specifically, the following South Carolina rules are being disapproved: (a)(2)(iv)(e); (a)(2)(iv)(f) (second sentence only); (a)(2)(vi); (b)(12); (b)(30)(iii)(h); (b)(34)(iii)(b); (b)(34)(vi)(d); (b)(35); (r)(6)—only the reference to the term “clean unit” is being disapproved. The remainder of this regulatory provision is being approved); (r)(7)—only the reference to the term “clean unit” is being disapproved. The remainder of this regulatory provision is being approved); (x); (y) and (z).
              (e) Regulation 61-62.5 Standard No. 7.1—EPA is disapproving two provisions of South Carolina's NNSR program (submitted on July 1, 2005) that relate to provisions that were vacated from the federal program by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on June 24, 2005. The two provisions vacated from the federal rules pertain to Pollution Control Projects (PCPs) and clean units. The PCP and clean unit references are severable from the remainder of the NNSR program. Specifically, the following sections of South Carolina Regulation 61-62.5 Standard No. 7.1 are being disapproved: (b)(5); (b)(6)—Second sentence only; (b)(8); (c)(4); (c)(6)(C)(viii); (c)(8)(C)(iii); (c)(8)(E)(v); (c)(10); (d)(1)(C)(ix); (d)(1)(C)(x); (d)(3)—Only the reference to the term “clean unit” is being disapproved. The remainder of this regulatory provision is being approved; (d)(4)—Only the reference to the term “clean unit” is being disapproved. The remainder of this regulatory provision is being approved; (f); (g) and (h). These disapprovals were amended in 73 FR 31371, (June 2, 2008)

              Control strategy: Ozone.
              (a) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined, as of November 15, 2011, the bi-state Charlotte-Gastonia-Rockhill, North Carolina-South Carolina nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standards for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.

              (b) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2008-2010, EPA determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of June 15, 2011. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2) to determine, based on the Area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the Area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, North Carolina-South Carolina, 1997 8-hour ozone nonattainment Area is not subject to the consequences of failing to attain pursuant to section 181(b)(2).
              (c) Determination of attainment. The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment area has attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Charlotte-Rock Hill, NC-SC nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

              VOC rule deficiency correction.
              Sections I and II of South Carolina's Regulations 62.1 and 62.5 is approved. The State submitted these regulations to EPA for approval on September 18, 1990. Sections I and II of Regulation 62.5 were intended to correct deficiencies cited in a letter calling for the State to revise its SIP for ozone from Mr. Greer C. Tidwell, the EPA Regional Administrator, to Governor Carroll A. Campbell on May 26, 1988, and clarified in a letter from Mr. Winston A. Smith, EPA Region IV, Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, to Mr. Otto E. Pearson, former Director of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control:
              (a) South Carolina's VOC regulations contain no method for determining capture efficiency. This deficiency must be corrected after EPA publishes guidance on the methods for determining capture efficiency before the SIP for ozone can be fully approved.

              § 52.2172
              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves South Dakota's plan as meeting the requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977.
              (b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
              (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:

              (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; or

              (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; and,
              (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:

              (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e; or

              (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more.
              (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
              (i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
              (ii) The term tpy CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
              (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.

              (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO2e.

              (iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in 40 CFR 52.21(a)(2)(iv)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs 40 CFR 52.21(b)(3) and (b)(23)(i)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO2e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO2e instead of applying the value in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(ii).

              § 52.2173
              Legal authority.
              (a) The requirements of § 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met since the South Dakota Compiled Law 34-16A-21 provides that data which relates to processes or production unique to the owner or which tend to adversely affect a competitive position of the owner shall be held confidential.
              (b) Delegation of authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, South Dakota requested a delegation of authority to enable it to collect, correlate and release emission data to the public. The Administrator has determined that South Dakota is qualified to receive a delegation of the authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator delegates to South Dakota his authority under sections 114(a) (1) and (2) and section 114(c) of the Act, i.e., authority to collect, correlate, and release emission data to the public.

              (b) Regulation for visibility monitoring and new source review. The provisions of § 52.28 are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for the State of New Hampshire.

              The State of South Dakota has committed to revise its stack height regulations should EPA complete rulemaking to respond to the decision in NRDC v. Thomas, 838 F.2d 1224 (DC Cir. 1988). In a letter to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, dated May 11, 1988, Joel C. Smith, Administrator, Office of Air Quality and Solid Waste, stated:
              
              
                “* * * We are submitting this letter to allow EPA to continue to process our current SIP submittal with the understanding that if EPA's response to the NRDC remand modifies the July 8, 1985 regulations, EPA will notify the State of the rules that must be changed to comport with the EPA's modified requirements. The State of South Dakota agrees to make the appropriate changes.”

              Conditional approval.

              Tennessee submitted a SIP revision on February 27, 2017, to add TCRR 1200-03-27-.12—“NOX SIP Call Requirements for Stationary Boilers and Combustion Turbines” (except paragraph 1200-03-27-.12(7)(b)4.) to the Tennessee SIP, which establishes a state control program to comply with the obligations of the NOX SIP Call. In letters dated May 11, 2018 and October 11, 2018, Tennessee committed to submit, by December 31, 2019, a complete SIP revision amending the rule's applicability provisions to cover certain potential new units. EPA conditionally approved the portion of the February 27, 2017, SIP revision to add TCRR 1200-03-27-.12 to the SIP in an action published in the Federal Register on March 6, 2019 based on this commitment. If Tennessee fails to meet its commitment by December 31, 2019, the conditional approval will become a disapproval and EPA will issue a notice to that effect.

              Legal authority.
              (a) The requirements of § 51.230(c) of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide the legal authority for controlling motor vehicles during air pollution emergency episodes.
              (b) The requirements of § 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance of a national air quality standard is not adequate.

              (c)(1) The requirements of § 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met since the definition of person set forth in the Tennessee Air Quality Act and in the State implementation plan does not include facilities owned or operated by the State. Therefore, section 53-3409(f) of the Tennessee Code Annotated and section 30 of Chapter II of the Tennessee Air Pollution Control Regulations are disapproved.
              (2) Definition of person. For the purposes of the plan, person shall mean any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, State-owned or operated facility, State agency, political subdivision, or any other legal entity, or their legal representatives, agents, or assigns.
              (d) The requirements of § 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met since the State lacks legal authority, as a result of the enactment of House Bill 1490 by the 1974 Tennessee legislature, to control emissions from the quarrying and processing of agricultural limestone. Therefore, section 53-3424 of the Tennessee Code Annotated is disapproved.
              (e) The requirements of § 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met since the State lacks legal authority, as a result of the enactment of House Bill 1845 by the 1974 Tennessee legislature, to control emissions from air contaminant sources which use woodwaste only as fuel. Therefore, the last sentence of section 53-3422 of the Tennessee Code Annotated is disapproved.

              VOC rule deficiency correction.
              (a) Revisions to sections 7-3, 7-13, and 7-24 of the Tennessee regulations are approved. These amendments are in response to the Clean Air Act section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement to submit RACT rules correcting deficiencies in the existing SIP in accordance with EPA's pre-amendment guidance. These deficiencies were first noted in a letter from Greer Tidwell, the EPA Region IV Administrator, to Governor McWherter on May 26, 1988, and clarified in a letter dated June 10, 1988, from Winston Smith, EPA Region IV Air Division Director, to Paul Bontrager, Director of the Air Pollution Control Division of the Metropolitan Health Department for Nashville/Davidson County, and were further identified in EPA guidance including the Blue Book and the proposed Post-87 policy. The following deficiency in the Tennessee Regulations, however, has not been corrected.
              (1) Section 7-25, “Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements” Nashville/Davidson County committed in a letter dated May 7, 1991, to include a separate provision that requires records to be maintained for at least two years. This additional provision, which is scheduled for a July 15, 1992, public hearing, will be submitted to EPA shortly after that date and will be acted upon separately.
              (2) In Section 7-3, Petition for Alternative Controls, the words “as applied” should be added to the term “VOC/gallon solids” as a clarification.
              (3) The term “vapor-tight” should be defined in section 7-13.
              (4) “Once-in/always-in” is missing from the applicability section of the individual rules.

              (5) Section 7-25, “Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements” should be revised to include additional requirements that would contain: units of compliance consistent with the performance requirements; applicable time periods for data entries; and a clear, separate provision that requires records to be kept.

              Review of new sources and modifications.
              (a) Part D—Conditional approval. The Nashville-Davidson County regulation for the review of new sources and modifications in nonattainment areas is approved on condition that the State by October 31, 1984, submit a revision limiting source shutdown credit for offsets to replacement units, and, in the interim, assure implementation of the regulation in conformity with Federal requirements.
              (b) Section 123—Conditional approval. The plan's provision for implementation of the requirements of section 123 of the Clean Air Act in Nashville-Davidson County is approved on condition that the State by October 31, 1984, submit:
              (1) Definitions in the local regulation of nearby and excessive concentration and
              (2) Provision in the local regulation for public notification and opportunity for hearing in cases where stack heights in excess of normal good engineering practice are proposed on the basis of fluid modeling demonstrations, and, in the interim, assure implementation of the local regulation in conformity with Federal requirements.
              (c) The State of Tennessee proposed to delete section 1200-3-18-.03 “Standard for New Sources” from the Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP) and the Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee SIP. EPA is disapproving the deletion of this rule for the Tennessee SIP because Tennessee does not have federally approved New Source Review (NSR) regulations which apply to some of the sources in this chapter. EPA is approving the deletion of this rule for the Memphis submittal because the federally approved TN NSR applies to the Memphis-Shelby County area.
              (d) The State of Tennessee proposed to delete rule 1200-3-18-.03 “Standard for New Sources” from the Tennessee State Implementation Plan (SIP). In paragraph (e) of this section, EPA disapproved the deletion of this rule because Tennessee did not have federally approved New Source Review (NSR) regulations that applied to some of the sources in this chapter. EPA is hereby approving the deletion of section 1200-3-18-.03 of the Tennessee SIP, and is deleting EPA's earlier disapproval in paragraph (e) of this section.

              (a) Part D conditional approval. The Chattanooga primary TSP plan's provisions for review of new sources and modifications in the nonattainment area are approved on condition that the State submit by December 31, 1987, a definition of the term Federally enforceable and provisions for making Federally enforceable all limitations, conditions, and offsets, including permit restrictions, relied upon under the plan, and in the interim, implement these provisions in a manner consistent with EPA requirements.
              (b) In letters dated March 9 and April 15, 1988, the Tennessee Department of Health and Environment certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules. This certification does not apply to: Dupont (43-07-02); Tennessee Valley Authority—Johnsonville (43-11-1 thru 10); Tennessee Chemical Company (70-04-21); Tennessee Eastman (82-03-15-19); A.E. Staley (53-81-18, 19, 34, 31); Cargill Inc., Memphis; and Grace Chemical Company, Millington.
              (c) Determination of Attaining Data. EPA has determined, as of May 31, 2011, the Chattanooga, Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 52.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (d) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined the Knoxville, Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (e) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined Knoxville-Sevierville-La Follette, Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS.
              (f) Determination of attainment. Effective June 9, 2017, the EPA has determined that, based on 2013 to 2015 ambient air quality data, the Knoxville-Sevierville-La Follette, Tennessee PM2.5 nonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of December 31, 2015. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 188(b)(2) to determine whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also has determined that the Knoxville-Sevierville-La Follette, Tennessee nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 188(b)(2).

              (a)(1) Paragraph 1200-3-9-.01(4)-(0)-2. of Tennessee's regulations is disapproved because it does not require that the consent of the Governor(s) of affected states be obtained when innovative technology waivers are granted. EPA retains permitting authority for sources requesting innovative technology waivers which would significantly impact air quality in adjacent states.
              (2) Tennessee's definition of stationary source specifically excludes the activities of any Vessel. This exclusion is not currently approvable and EPA is deferring action on it pending final rulemaking on the issue. EPA retains authority for permits which involve vessel emissions where a source is not willing to include all vessel emissions in the definition of source.

              (a) Determination—EPA is determining that, as of August 8, 1995, the Nashville ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Nashville ozone nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
              (b) Nonregulatory provisions for the implementation of a basic I/M program in Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties, submitted on July 13, 1994, were approved by EPA on September 26, 1995.
              (c) Determination of Attaining Data. EPA has determined, as of October 12, 2010 the Knoxville, Tennessee nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standards for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
              (d) Determination of attainment. The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2011 to 2013 ambient air quality data, the Knoxville, TN and Memphis, TN-MS-AR 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment areas have attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on an area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the areas attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Knoxville, TN and Memphis, TN-MS-AR nonattainment areas will not be reclassified for failure to attain by their applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).

              (a) The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation has submitted revisions to the Tennessee SIP on October 6, 1994. These revisions address the requirements necessary to change a lead nonattainment area to attainment. The maintenance plan for the Fayette County area near Rossville, Tennessee is comprised of a maintenance demonstration and NSR/PSD program. For areas where the only lead source has shut down, these components are sufficient for an approvable maintenance plan. The State's maintenance plan is complete and satisfies all of the requirements of section 175(A) of the CAA.
              (b) Determination of attaining data. EPA has determined the Bristol, Tennessee, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 2008 lead (Pb) NAAQS. This clean data determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2008 Pb NAAQS.

This approval exempts the area from implementing federal NOX RACT on major sources of NOX and exempts Tennessee from NOX conformity. This approval does not exempt sources from any State required or State Implementation Plan (SIP) approved NOX controls. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS occurs in the area, the exemption from the requirement of section 182(f) of the CAA in the applicable area shall not apply.

              § 52.2275
              Control strategy and regulations: Ozone.
              (a) Section 510.3 of revised Regulation V, which was submitted by the Governor on July 20, 1977, is disapproved.
              (b) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Texas Implementation Plan, the control measures listed in paragraph (d) of this section shall be implemented in accordance with the schedule set forth below.
              (c)(1) Removal from service of a 12,000 BPD vacuum distillation unit at the Corpus Christi refinery of the Champlin Petroleum Company, Corpus Christi, Texas, with a final compliance date no later than October 1, 1979. This shall result in an estimated hydrocarbon emission reduction of at least 139 tons per year.
              (2) Dedication of gasoline storage tank 91-TK-3 located at the Corpus Christi refinery of the Champlin Petroleum Company, Corpus Christi, Texas to the exclusive storage of No. 2 Fuel Oil or any fluid with a vapor pressure equivalent to, or less than that of No. 2 Fuel Oil, with a final compliance date no later than October 1, 1979. This shall result in an estimated hydrocarbon emission reduction of at least 107.6 tons per year.
              (d) Determinations that Certain Areas Did Not Attain the 1-Hour Ozone NAAQS. EPA has determined that the Houston/Galveston/Brazoria severe-17 1-hour ozone nonattainment area did not attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007. This determination bears on the area's obligations with respect to implementation of two specific 1-hour ozone standard anti-backsliding requirements: section 172(c)(9) contingency measures for failure to attain and sections 182(d)(3) and 185 major stationary source fee programs.

              (e) Approval—The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) submitted a revision to the Texas SIP on February 18, 2003, concerning the Victoria County 1-hour ozone maintenance plan. This SIP revision was adopted by TCEQ on February 5, 2003. This SIP revision satisfies the Clean Air Act requirement, as amended in 1990, for the second 10-year update to the Victoria County 1-hour ozone maintenance area.
              (f) Determination of attainment. Effective November 17, 2008 EPA has determined that the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's Clean Data Policy, this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration or 5% increment of progress plan, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other State Implementation Plans related to attainment of the 1-hour ozone NAAQS for so long as the area continues to attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS.
              (g) Approval. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) submitted a 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the area of El Paso County on January 20, 2006. The area is designated unclassifiable/attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. EPA determined this request for El Paso County was complete on June 13, 2006. The maintenance plan meets the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act and is consistent with EPA's maintenance plan guidance document dated May 20, 2005. The EPA therefore approved the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS maintenance plan for the area of El Paso County on January 15, 2009.
              (h) Determination of attainment for the 1-hour ozone standard and redesignation for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Effective November 19, 2010, EPA has determined that the Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) and has redesignated the area to attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. With this final redesignation to attainment for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS and this final determination of attainment for the 1-hour ozone NAAQS, the 1-hour anti-backsliding obligations to submit planning SIPs to meet the attainment demonstration and reasonably available control measures (RACM) requirements, and the ROP and contingency measures requirements, cease to apply.
              (i) Determination of attainment. Effective October 1, 2015 the EPA has determined that the Dallas/Fort Worth 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 ozone standard. Under the provisions of the EPA's Clean Data Policy, this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration and other State Implementation Plans related to attainment of the 1997 ozone NAAQS for so long as the area continues to attain the 1997 ozone NAAQS.
              (j) Approval of Redesignation Substitute for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria 1-hour Ozone Nonattainment Area. EPA has approved the redesignation substitute for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria 1-hour ozone nonattainment area submitted by the State of Texas on July 22, 2014. The State is no longer being required to adopt any additional applicable 1-hour ozone NAAQS requirements for the area.
              (k) Determination of Attainment. Effective January 29, 2016 the EPA has determined that the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 ozone standard. Under the provisions of the EPA's Clean Data Policy, this determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration and other State Implementation Plans related to attainment of the 1997 ozone NAAQS for so long as the area continues to attain the 1997 ozone NAAQS.
              (l) The portion of the SIP submitted on December 13, 2012 addressing Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) for the 2008 ozone NAAQS is disapproved.
              (m) Approval of Redesignation Substitute for the Dallas-Fort Worth 1-hour Ozone and 1997 Ozone Nonattainment Areas. EPA has approved the redesignation substitute for the Dallas-Fort Worth 1-hour ozone and 1997 ozone nonattainment areas submitted by the State of Texas on August 18, 2015. The State is no longer being required to adopt any additional applicable to 1-hour ozone and 1997 ozone NAAQS requirements for the area.
              (n) Approval of Redesignation Substitute for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria 1997 Ozone Nonattainment Area.
                EPA has approved the redesignation substitute for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria 1997 ozone NAAQS nonattainment area submitted by the State of Texas on August 18, 2015. The State is no longer being required to adopt any additional applicable 1997 ozone NAAQS requirements for the area.

              Interstate pollutant transport provisions; What are the FIP requirements for decreases in emissions of nitrogen oxides?

              (a)(1) The owner and operator of each source located within the State of Texas and for which requirements are set forth under the Federal CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program in subparts AA through II of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such applicable requirements. The obligation to comply with these requirements in part 97 of this chapter will be eliminated by the promulgation of an approval by the Administrator of a revision to the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP) as meeting the requirements of CAIR for PM2.5 relating to NOX under § 51.123 of this chapter, except to the extent the Administrator's approval is partial or conditional or unless such approval is under § 51.123(p) of this chapter.

              (2) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if, at the time of such approval of the State's SIP, the Administrator has already allocated CAIR NOX allowances to sources in the State for any years, the provisions of part 97 of this chapter authorizing the Administrator to complete the allocation of CAIR NOX allowances for those years shall continue to apply, unless the Administrator approves a SIP provision that provides for the allocation of the remaining CAIR NOX allowances for those years.
              (b) Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph (a) of this section and subparts AA through II of part 97 of this chapter to the contrary:
              (1) With regard to any control period that begins after December 31, 2014,

              (i) The provisions in paragraph (a) of this section relating to NOX annual emissions shall not be applicable; and

              (ii) The Administrator will not carry out any of the functions set forth for the Administrator in subparts AA through II of part 97 of this chapter;

              (2) The Administrator will not deduct for excess emissions any CAIR NOX allowances allocated for 2015 or any year thereafter;

              (3) By March 3, 2015, the Administrator will remove from the CAIR NOX Allowance Tracking System accounts all CAIR NOX allowances allocated for a control period in 2015 and any subsequent year, and, thereafter, no holding or surrender of CAIR NOX allowances will be required with regard to emissions or excess emissions for such control periods.

              (c)(1) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Texas and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NOX Annual Trading Program in subpart AAAAA of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements with regard to emissions occurring in 2015 and 2016.
              (2) [Reserved]

              (d)(1) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Texas and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 1 Trading Program in subpart BBBBB of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements with regard to emissions occurring in 2015 and 2016.

              (2) The owner and operator of each source and each unit located in the State of Texas and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth under the CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 2 Trading Program in subpart EEEEE of part 97 of this chapter must comply with such requirements with regard to emissions occurring in 2017 and each subsequent year.

              (103) Revisions to the Texas SIP addressing VOC RACT Negative Declarations. A revision to the Texas SIP was submitted on January 10, 1996, which included negative declarations for various categories. Section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires nonattainment areas to adopt, at a minimum, the reasonably available control technology (RACT) to reduce emissions from existing sources. Pursuant to section 182(b)(2) of the Act, for moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas, the EPA has identified 13 categories for such sources and developed the Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) or Alternate Control Techniques (ACTs) documents to implement RACT at those sources. When no major volatile organic compound (VOC) sources for a source category exist in a nonattainment area, a State may submit a negative declaration for that category. Texas submitted negative declarations for the areas and source categories listed in this paragraph (c)(103). For the Beaumont/Port Arthur region, negative declarations were submitted for the following eight categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For Dallas/Fort Worth, negative declarations were submitted for six categories: industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, shipbuilding and repair, autobody refinishing, plastic part coatings-business machines, and offset lithography. For the Houston/Galveston area, negative declarations were submitted for seven categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For El Paso, negative declarations were submitted for nine categories: industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. This submittal satisfies section 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for these particular CTG/ACT source categories for the Texas ozone nonattainment areas stated in this paragraph (c)(103).
              (i) Incorporation by reference. The letter dated January 10, 1996, from the Governor of Texas to the Regional Administrator, submitting the Post-1996 Rate of Progress Plan as a revision to the SIP, which included VOC RACT negative declarations.

              (i) For each unit, SO2 emissions for each calendar day shall be determined by summing the hourly emissions measured in pounds of SO2. For each unit, heat input for each boiler-operating-day shall be determined by adding together all hourly heat inputs, in millions of BTU. Each boiler-operating-day of the thirty-day rolling average for a unit shall be determined by adding together the pounds of SO2 from that day and the preceding 29-boiler-operating-days and dividing the total pounds of SO2 by the sum of the heat input during the same 30-boiler-operating-day period. The result shall be the 30-boiler-operating-day rolling average in terms of lb/MMBtu emissions of SO2. If a valid SO2 pounds per hour or heat input is not available for any hour for a unit, that heat input and SO2 pounds per hour shall not be used in the calculation of the 30-boiler-operating-day rolling average for SO2.

              (ii) In lieu of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, and if San Miguel meets paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, it may install a CEMS at the inlet of the scrubber system. The 30 BOD SO2 average from the existing outlet CEMS must read at or below 6.0% (94% control) of a 30 BOD SO2 average from the inlet CEMS.
              (5) Testing and monitoring. (i) No later than the compliance date as set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) for SO2 on the units listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in accordance with 40 CFR 60.8 and 60.13(e), (f), and (h), and appendix B of part 60 of this chapter. No later than the compliance date as set out in paragraph (a)(2), San Miguel must submit a letter to the Regional Administrator that informs the EPA which compliance option it elects, as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. San Miguel must then adhere to the compliance method set forth in that letter to the Regional Administrator. All owners or operators shall comply with the quality assurance procedures for CEMS found in 40 CFR part 75. Compliance with the emission limits for SO2 shall be determined by using data from a CEMS.

              (ii) Continuous emissions monitoring shall apply during all periods of operation of the coal burning equipment, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments. Continuous monitoring systems for measuring SO2 and diluent gas shall complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. Hourly averages shall be computed using at least one data point in each fifteen minute quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant in an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of performance of calibration, quality assurance, preventive maintenance activities, or backups of data from data acquisition and handling system, and recertification events. When valid SO2 pounds per hour, or SO2 pounds per million Btu emission data are not obtained because of continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span adjustments, emission data must be obtained by using other monitoring systems approved by the EPA to provide emission data for a minimum of 18 hours in each 24 hour period and at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler-operating-days.
              (6) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Unless otherwise stated all requests, reports, submittals, notifications, and other communications to the Regional Administrator required by this section shall be submitted, unless instructed otherwise, to the Director, Multimedia Planning and Permitting Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, to the attention of Mail Code: 6PD, at 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 1200, Dallas, Texas 75202-2733. For each unit subject to the emissions limitation in this section and upon completion of the installation of CEMS as required in this section, the owner or operator shall comply with the following requirements:
              (i) For each emissions limit in this section, comply with the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for CEMS compliance monitoring in 40 CFR 60.7(c) and (d).
              (ii) For each day, provide the total SO2 emitted that day by each emission unit. For any hours on any unit where data for hourly pounds or heat input is missing, identify the unit number and monitoring device that did not produce valid data that caused the missing hour.
              (7) Equipment operations. At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner or operator shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate the unit including associated air pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Regional Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the unit.
              (8) Enforcement. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision in this implementation plan, any credible evidence or information relevant as to whether the unit would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not the owner or operator has violated or is in violation of any standard or applicable emission limit in the plan.
              (ii) Emissions in excess of the level of the applicable emission limit or requirement that occur due to a malfunction shall constitute a violation of the applicable emission limit.

              Particulate Matter (PM 10) Group II SIP commitments.

              On July 18, 1988, the Governor of Texas submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) that contained commitments for implementing all of the required activities including monitoring, reporting, emission inventory, and other tasks that may be necessary to satisfy the requirements of the PM10 Group II SIPs. The Texas Air Control Board adopted these revisions on May 13, 1988. The State of Texas has committed to comply with the PM10 Group II SIP requirements, as articulated in the Federal Register notice of July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24670), for the defined areas of Dallas, Harris, Lubbock, and Nueces counties as provided in the Texas PM10 Group II SIPs. In addition to the SIP, a letter from the Governor of Texas, dated July 18, 1988, stated that:
              
              
                * * * In the July 1, 1987 issue of the Federal Register, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the requirement that each state submit a committal SIP for PM10 Group II areas instead of full control strategies. States were also required to submit demonstrations of attainment and maintenance of the PM10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The TACB is committed to carrying out the activities contained in the enclosed proposed SIP to satisfy those requirements * * *.

              Small business assistance program.
              The Governor of Texas submitted on November 13, 1992 a plan revision to develop and implement a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program to meet the requirements of section 507 of the Clean Air Act by November 15, 1994. The plan commits to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses, hire an Ombudsman to serve as an independent advocate for small businesses, and establish a Compliance Advisory Panel to advise the program and report to the EPA on the program's effectiveness.

              § 52.2308
              Area-wide nitrogen oxides (NOX) exemptions.

              (a) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition requesting that the Dallas ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the NOX control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The Dallas nonattainment area consists of Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, and Collin counties. The exemption request was based on a photochemical grid modeling which shows that the Dallas nonattainment area would attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the additional NOX controls required under section 182(f). On November 21, 1994, the EPA conditionally approved this exemption request, conditioned upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the Dallas attainment demonstration SIP.

              (b) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition requesting that the El Paso ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the NOX control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The El Paso nonattainment area consists of El Paso county, and shares a common airshed with Juarez, Mexico. The exemption request was based on a photochemical grid modeling which shows that the El Paso nonattainment area would attain the NAAQS for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the additional NOX controls required under section 182(f), but for emissions emanating from Mexico. On November 21, 1994, the EPA conditionally approved this exemption request, conditioned upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the El Paso attainment demonstration SIP.

              (c) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted to the EPA on May 4, 1994, a petition requesting that the Victoria County incomplete data ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the requirement to meet the NOX provisions of the Federal transportation conformity rule. The exemption request was based on monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone had been attained in this area for the 35 months prior to the petition, with the understanding that approval of the State's request would be contingent upon the collection of one additional month of data. The required additional month of verified data was submitted later and, together with the data submitted with the State's petition, demonstrated attainment of the NAAQS for 36 consecutive months. The EPA approved this exemption request on March 2, 1995.

              (d) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on August 17, 1994, with supplemental information submitted on August 31, 1994, and September 9, 1994, a petition requesting that the Houston and Beaumont ozone nonattainment areas be temporarily exempted from the NOX control requirements of section 182(f) of the CAA. The Houston nonattainment area consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller counties. The Beaumont nonattainment area consists of Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange counties. The exemption request was based on photochemical grid modeling which shows that reductions in NOX would not contribute to attaining the ozone NAAQS. On April 12, 1995, the EPA approved the State's request for a temporary exemption. Approval of the temporary exemption waives the federal requirements for NOX Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), New Source Review (NSR), conformity, and vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) for the period of the temporary exemption. The temporary exemption automatically expires on December 31, 1996, without further notice from the EPA. Based on the rationale provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this action, upon the expiration of the temporary exemption, the requirements pertaining to NOX RACT, NSR, conformity, and I/M will again become applicable, except that the NOX RACT implementation date applicable to the Houston and Beaumont nonattainment areas under section 182(f) shall be as expeditious as practicable but no later than May 31, 1997, unless the State has received a permanent NOX exemption from the EPA prior to that time.

              (e) The TNRCC submitted to EPA on March 6, 1996, a petition requesting that the Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment areas be granted an extension to a previously-granted temporary exemption from the NOX control requirements of sections 182(f) and 182(b) of the Clean Air Act. The temporary exemption was granted on April 19, 1995. The current petition is based on the need for more time to complete UAM to confirm the need for, and the extent of, NOX controls required. On May 23, 1997, EPA approved the State's request for an extension to the temporary exemption. The temporary extension automatically expires on December 31, 1997, without further notice from EPA. Upon expiration of the extension, the requirements pertaining to NOX RACT, NSR, I/M, general and transportation conformity will become applicable, except that the NOX RACT compliance date shall be implemented as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than May 31, 1999, unless the State has received a contingent NOX exemption from the EPA prior to that time.
              (f) The extension of the temporary exemption from NOX control requirements of sections 182(f) and 182(b) of the Clean Air Act for the Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment areas granted on May 23, 1997, expired December 31, 1997. Upon expiration of the extension, the requirements pertaining to NOX RACT, NSR, I/M, general and transportation conformity will become applicable and the State is expected to implement the requirements as expeditiously as possible.

              (g) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted a letter to EPA requesting rescission of the previously-granted conditional exemption from the NOX control requirements of section 182(f) of the Act for the Dallas/Fort Worth ozone nonattainment area. The letter was sent on November 13, 1998. The conditional exemption was granted on November 21, 1994, conditioned upon EPA approving the modeling portion of the DFW attainment demonstration SIP. The conditional exemption was also approved on a contingent basis. The modeling-based exemption would last only as long as the area's modeling continued to demonstrate attainment without the additional NOX reductions required by section 182(f). The State's request is based on new photochemical modeling which shows the need for NOX controls to help the area attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Furthermore, EPA would not and could not approve the earlier attainment demonstration SIP modeling upon which the condition was based.
              (1) On June 21, 1999, the conditional NOX exemption for the DFW area granted on November 21, 1994 is rescinded. Upon rescission, the Federal requirements pertaining to NOX Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), New Source Review, vehicle Inspection/Maintenance, general and transportation conformity now apply.
              
              (2) The NOX RACT final compliance date must be implemented as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than March 31, 2001.

              Emissions inventories.
              (a) The Governor of the State of Texas submitted the 1990 base year emission inventories for the Houston/Galveston (HGA), Beaumont/Port Arthur (BPA), El Paso (ELP), and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) ozone nonattainment areas on November 17, 1992 as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The 1990 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for each of these areas.
              (b) The inventories are for the ozone precursors which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventories cover point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources.
              (c) The HGA nonattainment area is classified as Severe-17 and includes Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties; the BPA nonattainment area is classified as Serious and includes Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange Counties; the ELP nonattainment area is classified as Serious and includes El Paso County; and the DFW nonattainment area is classified as Moderate and includes Collin, Dallas, Denton, and Tarrant Counties.
              (d) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted State Implementation Plan revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory for the Beaumont/Port Arthur area with a cover letter from the Governor of Texas dated August 9, 1996.
              (e) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on August 9, 1996. This revision was submitted for the purpose of satisfying the 15% Rate-of-Progress requirements of the Clean Air Act, which will aid in ensuring the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone. This submittal also contained revisions to the 1990 base year emissions inventories for the Dallas/Fort Worth, El Paso and Houston/Galveston areas.
              (f) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on May 19, 2000. This revision was submitted for the purpose of satisfying the 9 percent Rate-of-Progress requirements of the Clean Air Act, which will aid in ensuring the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone. This submission also contained revisions to the 1990 base year emissions inventory for the Houston/Galveston areas.

              Motor vehicle antitampering.
              The State of Texas submitted revisions to the State Implementation Plan for 30 TAC Chapter 114, sections 114.1 “Maintenance and Operation of Air Pollution Control Systems or Devices Used to Control Emissions from Motor Vehicles” and 114.5 “Exclusions and Exceptions” on February 24, 1989, and September 6, 1990, and July 13, 1993. The EPA disapproved these revisions that relate to Statewide antitampering provisions and exemptions to antitampering provisions for motor vehicles or motor vehicle engine emission control systems because the State's antitampering rules are not consistent with the Act, section 203(a)(3) and EPA's tampering prohibitions as outlined in EPA's antitampering enforcement policy, Mobile Source Enforcement Memorandum No. 1A.

              Extensions.

              (a) The Administrator, by authority delegated under section 188(d) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, extends for one year (until December 31, 1995) the attainment date for the Salt Lake County PM10 nonattainment area. The Administrator, by authority delegated under section 188(d) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, extends for two years (until December 31, 1996) the attainment date for the Utah County PM10 nonattainment area.
              (b) [Reserved]
              [66 FR 32760, June 18, 2001]
            
            
              § 52.2323
              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Utah's plan as meeting the requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below.
              (b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
              (2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:

              (i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; or
              

              (ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; and,
              (3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:

              (i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e; or

              (ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO2e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO2e or more.
              (4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
              (i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
              (ii) The term tpy CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
              (A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.

              (B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO2e.

              (iii) the term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in 40 CFR 52.21(a)(2)(iv)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs 40 CFR 52.21(b)(3) and (b)(23)(i)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO2e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO2e instead of applying the value in 40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(ii).

              (73) On March 22, 2007, the Governor submitted revisions to Section IX, Part D of the Utah State Implementation Plan (SIP) in the form of a maintenance plan for the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for Salt Lake County and Davis County. On March 22, 2007, the Governor also submitted revisions to associated rules: UAC R307-101-2, R307-110-13, R307-320, R307-325, R307-326, R307-327, R307-328, R307-335, R307-340, R307-341, and R307-342. EPA is approving the maintenance plan, except for the following aspects, which EPA is disapproving: those contingency measures listed in section 6.d of the State's maintenance plan that are voluntary in nature, which consist of: “Alert Day Enhancements,” “Heavy Equipment Emission Control Program,” “Reduce Emissions of VOCs” (to the extent the State would adopt and implement the measure as a voluntary commitment rather than a regulatory measure), “Identification of High-Polluting Vehicles,” and “Other VOC or NOX emissions control measures as appropriate” (to the extent such measures would be voluntary); the contingency measure listed in section 6.d of the State's maintenance plan as “Establish an Offset Ratio for NOX;” the State's proposal in section 5.a.(3)(b)of the maintenance plan to remove from the SIP the VOC RACT approval orders for Hill Air Force Base; the State's proposal in section 5.b.(1) of the maintenance plan to remove from the SIP the NOX RACT limits for the PacifiCorp Gadsby Power Plant; and section 5.g of the maintenance plan, which indicates that the employer-based trip reduction program is included as part of the plan. EPA is approving the revisions to UAC R307-110-13, which incorporates the maintenance plan into Utah's rules, but only to the extent we are approving the 1997 8-hour ozone maintenance plan. EPA is disapproving UAC R307-320, the employer-based trip reduction program. EPA is approving the revisions to UAC R307-325, R307-326, R307-327, R307-328, R307-335, R307-340, R307-341, and R307-342, subject to our interpretation of these rules expressed in the preamble to our rulemaking action. EPA is not acting on the revisions to UAC R307-101-2 because the revisions have been superseded by later revisions to the rule, which EPA approved at § 52.2320(c)(67).

              (75) On September 15, 2006, the Governor submitted revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan (SIP) permitting rules. The September 15, 2006 submittal contains new, amended and renumbered rules in Utah Administrative Code (UAC) Title R-307 that pertain to the issuance of Utah air quality permits. EPA is approving the following rules or parts of rules from the September 15, 2006 submittal: R307-401-1 through 6; R307-401-8; R307-401-9 (except for paragraph (b) and the portions of paragraph (c) that reference paragraph (b)); R307-401-10 through 11; R307-401-13; R307-401-17 through 20; and R307-410-1 through 4. EPA is disapproving the following rules or parts of rules from the September 15, 2006 submittal: R307-401-7; R307-401-9(b) and the portions of 9(c) that reference (9)(b); R307-401-12; and R307-410-5. EPA is limitedly approving and limitedly disapproving R307-410-6 from the September 15, 2006 submittal—this means EPA is approving this rule because it will strengthen the SIP but is simultaneously disapproving it because it does not fully comply with applicable requirements. EPA is not acting on the revisions to UAC R307-101-2 because the revisions have been superseded by later revisions to the rule, which EPA approved at § 52.2320(c)(67) (see 73 FR 51222). EPA is not acting on R307-401-14 through 16 because EPA previously acted on such provisions (notice of final rulemaking signed October 19, 2012).

              (xiv) Municipal waste combustor organics (measured as total tetra-through octa-chlorinated diebenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans): 3.2 × 10M6 megagrams per year (3.5 × 10M6 tons per year).
              (xv) Municipal waste combustor metals (measured as particulate matter): 14 megagrams per year (15 tons per year).
              (xvi) Municipal waste combustor acid gases (measured as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride): 36 megagrams per year (40 tons per year).
              (xvii) Municipal solid waste landfills emissions (measured as nonmethane organic compounds): 45 megagrams per year (50 tons per year).
              (7) Regulated NSR pollutant, for purposes of this section means the following:
              (i) Any pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard has been promulgated and any pollutant identified under 40 CFR 52.21(b)(50)(i) as a constituent or precursor for such pollutant. Precursors identified by the EPA Administrator for purposes of NSR are the following:
              (A) Volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides are precursors to ozone in all attainment and unclassifiable areas.
              (B) Sulfur dioxide is a precursor to PM2.5 in all attainment and unclassifiable areas.

              (C) Nitrogen oxides are presumed to be precursors to PM2.5 in all attainment and unclassifiable areas, unless the State demonstrates to the EPA Administrator's satisfaction or EPA demonstrates that emissions of nitrogen oxides from sources in a specific area are not a significant contributor to that area's ambient PM2.5 concentrations.

              (D) Volatile organic compounds are presumed not to be precursors to PM2.5 in any attainment or unclassifiable area, unless the State demonstrates to the EPA Administrator's satisfaction or EPA demonstrates that emissions of volatile organic compounds from sources in a specific area are a significant contributor to that area's ambient PM2.5 concentrations.
              (ii) Any pollutant that is subject to any standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act;
              (iii) Any Class I or II substance subject to a standard promulgated under or established by title VI of the Act;
              (iv) Any pollutant that otherwise is subject to regulation under the Act.

              (v) Notwithstanding 40 CFR 52.21(b)(50)(i) through (iv), the term regulated NSR pollutant shall not include any or all hazardous air pollutant either listed in section 112 of the Act, or added to the list pursuant to section 112(b)(2) of the Act, and which have not been delisted pursuant to section 122(b)(3) of the Act, unless the listed hazardous air pollutant is also regulated as a constituent or precursor of a general pollutant listed under section 108 of the Act.
              (vi) Participate matter (PM) emissions, PM2.5 emissions and PM10 emissions shall include gaseous emissions from a source or activity which condense to form particulate matter at ambient temperatures. On or after January 1, 2011 (or any earlier date established in the upcoming rulemaking codifying test methods), such condensable particulate matter shall be accounted for in applicability determinations and in establishing emissions limitations for PM, PM2.5 and PM10 in PSD permits. Compliance with emissions limitations for PM, PM2.5 and PM10 issued prior to this date shall not be based on condensable particular matter unless required by the terms and conditions of the permit or the applicable implementation plan. Applicability determinations made prior to this date without accounting for condensable particular matter shall not be considered in violation of this section unless the applicable implementation plan required condensable particular matter to be included.
              
              (8) Ambient air increments. (i) In areas designated as Class I, II, or III, increases in pollutant concentration over the baseline concentration shall be limited to the following:

              Stack height regulations.

              The State of Utah has committed to revise its stack height regulations should EPA complete rulemaking to respond to the decision in NRDC v. Thomas, 838 F. 2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). In a letter to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, dated May 27, 1988, F. Burnell Cordner, Director, Bureau of Air Quality, stated:
              
              
                * * * We are submitting this letter to allow EPA to continue to process our current SIP submittal with the understanding that if the EPA's response to the NRDC remand modifies the July 8, 1985 regulations, the EPA will notify the State of the rules that must be changed to comply with the EPA's modified requirements. The State of Utah agrees to process appropriate changes.

              National Highway Systems Designation Act Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Programs.
              (a) On March 15, 1996 the Governor of Utah submitted a revised I/M program for Utah County which included a credit claim, a basis in fact for the credit claimed, a description of the County's program, draft County ordinances, and authorizing legislation for the program. Approval is granted on an interim basis for a period of 18 months, under the authority of section 348 of the National Highway Systems Designation Act of 1995. If Utah County fails to start its program by November 15, 1997 at the latest, this approval will convert to a disapproval after EPA sends a letter to the State. At the end of the eighteen month period, the approval will lapse. At that time, EPA must take final rulemaking action upon the State's SIP, under the authority of section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Final action on the State/County's plan will be taken following EPA's review of the State/County's credit evaluation and final regulations (State and County) as submitted to EPA.

              (b) On May 20, 1999, the State of Utah submitted an evaluation of the Utah County inspection and maintenance program. On December 7, 2001, the Governor of Utah submitted Rule R307-110-34 and Section X, Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program, Part D, Utah County. These submittals satisfy the interim approval requirements specified under section 348 of the National Highway Systems Designation Act of 1995 (62 FR 31351, 63 FR 414). Under the authority of section 110 of the Clean Air Act, EPA is removing the interim status of Utah County's improved inspection and maintenance program and granting Utah County full final approval of their improved inspection and maintenance program.

              Emission inventories.
              (a) The Governor of the State of Utah submitted the 1990 base year emission inventory of ozone precursors, which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide, for the Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area on January 13, 1995, as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). This inventory addresses emissions from point, area, non-road, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources. This Governor's submittal was followed by the submittal of corrections to the inventory, on April 20, 1995, from Russell Roberts, Director, Division of Air Quality, Utah Department of Environmental Quality. The ozone maintenance plan for Salt Lake and Davis Counties that the Governor submitted on February 19, 1997, incorporates by reference the corrected 1990 base year ozone emission inventory as background material. The 1990 ozone base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for the Salt Lake and Davis Counties area.
              (b) On November 12, 1997, the Governor of Utah submitted the 1993 Carbon Monoxide Periodic Emission Inventories for Ogden City and Utah County as revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan. These inventories address carbon monoxide emissions from stationary point, area, non-road, and on-road mobile sources.
              (c) On June 14, 1999, the Governor of Utah submitted the 1996 Carbon Monoxide Periodic Emission Inventory for Utah County as a revision to the Utah State Implementation Plan. The inventory addresses carbon monoxide emissions from stationary point, area, non-road mobile, and on-road mobile sources.

              On May 2, 1997, Ursula Trueman, Director, Division of Air Quality, Utah Department of Environmental Quality, submitted, on behalf of the State of Utah and pursuant to section 182(f)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, a section 182(f)(2) NOX Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) exemption request for major stationary sources of NOX in the Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area other than the Pacificorp Gadsby and Kennecott Utah Copper Utah Power Plants. The exemption request was based on ambient air quality monitoring data which demonstrated that the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) had been attained in the Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area for the years 1990 through 1996. EPA approved this NOX RACT exemption request on July 2, 1997.

              Change to approved plan.
              (a) Utah Air Conservation Regulation R307-18-1, New Source Performance Standards, is removed from the approved plan. On June 10, 2002, we issued a letter delegating responsibility for all sources located, or to be located, in the State of Utah subject to the NSPS in 40 CFR part 60. See the table in 40 CFR 60.4 for the status of NSPS delegated to the state of Utah.
              (b) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-8, Asbestos Work Practices, Contractor Certification, AHERA Accreditation and AHERA Implementation, is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). This rule language pertains to the regulation of asbestos and is generally not related to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and therefore it is not appropriate to be in Utah's SIP.

              (c) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-4.12, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs), is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). Utah has delegation of authority for NESHAPs in 40 CFR part 61 (49 FR 36368), pursuant to 110(k)(6) of the Act.
              (d) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-6, Eligibility of Pollution Control Expenditures for Sales Tax Exemption, is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). This rule language pertains to State Sales Tax Exemptions for Pollution Control Expenditures and is not generally related to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and is therefore not appropriate to be in Utah's SIP.
              (e) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-102-3, Administrative Procedures and Hearings, and R307-414-3, Request for Review, are removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). These provisions are not required by the CAA and are, therefore, not required to be in Utah's SIP. These provisions were last approved in 40 CFR 52.2320(c)(59)(i)(A).
              (f) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-4.06, Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Program (CEMSP), is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). This rule has been superseded and replaced by rule R307-170, Continuous Emission Monitoring Program.

              (a) CAA Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) requirements for the 1997 8-hour ozone and PM2.5 standards. Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, of the Utah SIP submitted by the Utah Governor on March 22, 2007, satisfies the requirements of the Clean Air Act Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 8-hour ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS promulgated by EPA in July 1997. Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, was adopted by the UAQB on February 9, 2007. The March 22, 2007 Governor's letter included as an attachment a set of replacement pages for the Interstate Transport text. The new pages reflect correctly that the Interstate Transport declaration is under Section XXIII of the Utah SIP and not under Section XXII as incorrectly indicated in the pages submitted with the Administrative Documentation for the adoption of this SIP section.

              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Vermont's plan as identified in § 52.2370 for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January, 1978 and January, 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.

              (a) [Resreved]
              (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
              (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
              (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
              (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

              Visibility protection.
              (a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the plan does not include approvable procedures meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.

              § 52.2384
              Stack height review.
              The State of Vermont has declared to the satisfaction of EPA that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height credits greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited dispersion techniques as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as revised on July 8, 1985. This declaration was submitted to EPA on March 21, 1986. The State has further declared in a letter from Harold T. Garabedian, dated March 21, 1986, that, “[T]he State concludes that our present rule 5-502(4)(d) is adequate to insure that new emission sources will not be able to use credits from modeling ambient impacts at greater than ‘good engineering practice’ stack height or from using ‘other dispersion techniques.’ ” Thus, Vermont has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

              § 52.2423
              Approval status.
              (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Virginia's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards.
              (b)-(e) [Reserved]
              (f) Section 9VAC 5-40-20.A.4. of the Virginia Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution is not considered part of the applicable plan because it contradicts a previously approved section of the SIP.
              (g) [Reserved]

              (h) In an April 19, 1991 request submitted by the Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control, the source-specific emission limitation for James River Paper which EPA had approved on August 18, 1983 is deleted. James River Paper Co. (now known as Custom Papers Group—Richmond, Inc.) located in Richmond, Virginia is now required to comply with the applicable Virginia SIP paper coating regulation.
              
              (i) Pursuant to an October 31, 1991 request submitted by the Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control, the source-specific Alternate Control Program (bubble) for J.W. Fergusson & Sons, Inc. which EPA had approved on March 4, 1983, is removed from the plan. J.W. Fergusson & Sons, Inc. located in Richmond, Virginia is required to comply with the Virginia SIP graphic arts RACT regulation approved by EPA on January 25, 1984 (see 40 CFR 52.2420(c)(48) and (c)(74)).
              (j)-(l) [Reserved]
              (m) EPA approves as part of the Virginia State Implementation Plan the documents listed in Appendix M, Sections II.A. through II.E and Section II.G. (currently Regulation 5-20-21 E.1. through E.5 and E.7) of the Virginia Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution submitted by the Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control on April 12, 1989.
              (n) EPA approves as part of the Virginia State Implementation Plan the revised references to the documents listed in Appendix M, Sections II.A. and II.B. (currently Regulation 5-20-21E.1 and E.2) of the Virginia Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution submitted by the Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control on February 12, 1993.
              (o) EPA approves the revised confidentiality of information provisions of Sections 120-02-30, submitted by the Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control on March 18, 1993, as revisions to the Virginia SIP. However, should Virginia submit a SIP revision request on behalf of a source, which contains information that has been judged confidential under the provisions of Section 120-02-30, Virginia must request EPA to consider confidentiality according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 2. EPA is obligated to keep such information confidential only if the criteria of 40 CFR part 2 are met.

              (p) EPA disapproves the revised public participation provisions of Sections 120-08-01G.1 and 120-08-01G.4.b, submitted by the Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control on March 29, 1993, as revisions to the Virginia SIP. These revised provisions do not meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.160 and 51.161. In its place, EPA retains the SIP provisions of Section 120-08-01C.1.a and 01C.4.b through d. as originally approved at §§ 52.2420(c)(69) [SIP section 2.33(a)(5)(ii)] and subsequently revised, due to format changes, at §§ 52.2420(c)(89)(i)(B)(7) [SIP section 120-08-01C.4.b].
              (q) EPA approves as part of the Virginia State Implementation Plan the following revisions to the Virginia Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Pollution submitted by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality on October 9, 1998:
              (1) Subpart T of 9 VAC 5-60-100 Designated emission standards of Rule 6-2 (9 VAC 5-60-90 et seq.) of 9 VAC 5 Chapter 60 amended to adopt 40 CFR 63.460 through 63.469 by reference. This amendment was adopted on January 8, 1997, published in the Virginia Register of Regulations on March 31, 1997 and effective on May 1, 1997.
              (2) Revised date reference to 40 CFR part 63 (July 1, 1996) contained in 9 VAC 5-60-90 (General), as it pertains to the documents listed in 9 VAC 5-60-100, Subpart T.
              (r) EPA approves as part of the Virginia State Implementation Plan the revised references to the documents listed in Chapter 20, Section 9 VAC 5-20-21 (formerly Appendix M), Sections E.4.a.(1), E.4.a.(2), and E.7.a.(1) through E.7.a.(3), of the Virginia Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution submitted by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality on June 22, 1999.
              (s) EPA approves as part of the Virginia State Implementation Plan the references to the documents listed in 9 VAC 5 Chapter 20, Section 5-20-21, paragraph E.12 of the Virginia Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution submitted by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality on February 23, 2004.

              (2) The site shall complete the powerhouse conversion (completion of the powerhouse conversion) no later than 30 months after the effective date of the permit.
              (h) Monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. (1) The permit shall set forth monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the site-wide emissions caps. The monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements shall be structured in a tiered system, such that the requirements become more stringent as the site's emissions approach the total emissions cap.

              (2) At a minimum, the permit shall require that the site submit to the permitting authority semi-annual reports of the site-wide criteria pollutant emissions (expressed as a 12-month rolling total) for each month covered by the report. These reports shall include a calculation of the total emissions cap, as well as, the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and PM10.

              (3) Any reports required by the permit to be submitted on an annual or semi-annual basis shall contain a certification by the site's responsible official that to his belief, based on reasonable inquiry, the information submitted in the report is true, accurate, and complete.
              (4) Any records required by the permit shall be retained on site for at least five years.
              (i) Air quality analysis. The permittee shall demonstrate, prior to permit issuance and on a periodic basis which shall be specified in the permit, that emissions from construction or operation of the site will not cause or contribute to air pollution in excess of any:
              (1) Maximum allowable increase or maximum allowable concentration for any pollutant, pursuant to section 165 of the Act;
              (2) National ambient air quality standard or;
              (3) Other applicable emission standard or standard of performance under the Act.
              (j) Termination. (1) The permit may be terminated as provided in this paragraph for reasons which shall include the following, as well as any other termination provisions specified in the permit:
              (i) If the Administrator or the permitting authority determines that continuation of the permit is an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare, or the environment;
              (ii) If the permittee knowingly falsifies emissions data;
              (iii) If the permittee fails to implement the powerhouse conversion pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section;
              (iv) If the permittee receives four consent orders or two judgments adverse to the site arising from non-compliance with this permit in a five year period that are deemed material by the Administrator or the permitting authority; or
              (v) If the total emissions cap is exceeded.
              (2) In the event of termination, the Administrator or the permitting authority shall provide the permittee with written notice of its intent to terminate the permit. Within 30 calendar days of the site's receipt of this notice, the site may take corrective action to remedy the cause of the termination. If this remedy, which may include a corrective action plan and schedule, is deemed acceptable by the Administrator or the permitting authority (whichever agency provided written notice of its intent to terminate the permit), the action to terminate the permit shall be withdrawn. Otherwise, the permit shall be terminated in accordance with procedures specified in the permit.
              (3) Termination of the permit does not waive the site's obligation to complete any corrective actions relating to non-compliance under the permit.
              (k) Inspection and entry. (1) Upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the site shall allow authorized representatives of the Administrator and the permitting authority to perform the following:
              (i) Enter upon the site;

              (i) Where a new major stationary source or major modification would be subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements for greenhouse gases (GHGs) under 40 CFR 52.21 but would not be subject to PSD under the state implementation plan (SIP) because CO2 emissions from the industrial combustion of biomass are excluded from consideration as GHGs as a matter of state law under RCW 70.235.020(3); or

              (ii) Where a new major stationary source or major modification is subject to PSD for GHGs under both the Washington SIP and the FIP, but CO2 emissions from the industrial combustion of biomass are excluded from consideration in the Ecology PSD permitting process because of the exclusion in RCW 70.235.020(3);
              (2) Indian reservations in Washington, except for non-trust land within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Indian Reservation (also known as the 1873 Survey Area) as provided in the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989, 25 U.S.C. 1773, and any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction.

              (3) Sources subject to PSD permits issued by the EPA prior to August 7, 1977, but only with respect to the general administration of any such permits still in effect (e.g., modifications, amendments, or revisions of any nature).
              (b) Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air quality. The provisions of § 52.21, except paragraph (a)(1), are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for Washington for the facilities, emission sources, geographic areas, and permits listed in paragraph (a) of this section. For situations addressed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the EPA will issue a Federal PSD permit under § 52.21 to the new major stationary source or major modification addressing PSD requirements applicable to GHGs for all subject emission units at the source, regardless of whether CO2 emissions resulted from the industrial combustion of biomass or from other sources of GHGs at the facility. For situations addressed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the EPA will issue a Federal PSD permit under § 52.21 addressing PSD requirements applicable to GHGs for each subject emissions unit that is permitted to emit CO2 from the industrial combustion of biomass.

              (c) In accordance with section 164 of the Clean Air Act and the provisions of 40 CFR 52.21(g), the Spokane Indian Reservation is designated as a Class I area for the purposes of preventing significant deterioration of air quality.

              (a) Applicability. This section applies to the Alcoa Inc.—Wenatchee Works primary aluminum smelter (Wenatchee Works) located near Wenatchee, Washington and to its successors and/or assignees.
              (b) Best available retrofit technology (BART) emission limitations for Potline 5—(1) Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission limit. Starting November 10, 2014, SO2 emissions from Potline 5 must not exceed 46 pounds per ton of aluminum produced during any calendar month as calculated in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
              (i) Compliance demonstration. Alcoa must determine SO2 emissions, on a calendar month basis using the following formulas:
              
              SO2 emissions in pounds = (carbon ratio) × (tons of aluminum produced during the calendar month) × (% sulfur in baked anodes/100) × (% sulfur converted to SO2/100) × (2 pounds of SO2 per pound of sulfur) × (2000 pounds per ton)
              
              SO2 emissions in pounds per ton of aluminum produced = (SO2 emissions in pounds during the calendar month)/(tons of aluminum produced during the calendar month)
              
              (A) The carbon ratio is the calendar month average of tons of baked anodes consumed per ton of aluminum produced as determined using the baked anode consumption and aluminum production records required in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
              (B) The % sulfur in baked anodes is the calendar month average sulfur content as determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (C) The % sulfur converted to SO2 is 90%.
              (ii) Emission monitoring. The % sulfur of baked anodes must be determined using ASTM Method D6376 or an alternative method approved by the EPA Region 10.
              (A) At a minimum, Alcoa must collect no less than four baked anode core samples during each calendar week.
              (B) Calendar month average sulfur content must be determined by averaging the sulfur content of all samples collected during the calendar month.
              (2) Particulate matter (PM) emission limit. Starting November 10, 2014, PM emissions from the Potline 5 Gas Treatment Center stack must not exceed 0.005 grains per dry standard cubic foot of exhaust gas.

              (i) Compliance demonstration. Alcoa must determine NOX emissions, on a calendar month basis using the following formula:
              
              NOX emissions in tons per calendar month = (the emission factor determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, in pounds of NOX per ton of aluminum produced) × (number of tons of aluminum produced in the calendar month)/(2000 pounds per ton).
              
              (ii) NO
                X
                emission factor development. By September 9, 2014, Alcoa must submit to the EPA a plan for testing NOX emissions from Potline 5 and developing an emission factor in terms of pounds of NOX per ton of aluminum produced. This plan must include testing NOX emissions from both the Gas Treatment Center stack and the potline roof vents along with measurements of volumetric flow and aluminum production such that mass emissions can be determined and correlated with aluminum production. Within 90 days after the EPA approval of the plan, Alcoa shall conduct the testing and submit the resultant emission factor to the EPA at the address listed in paragraph (i)(5) of this section.
              (iii) NO
                X
                emission limit. NOX emission limit in tons per calendar month = (the emission factor determined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, in pounds of NOX per ton of aluminum produced) × (5546.2 tons of aluminum per month)/(2000 pounds per ton).

              (i) Compliance demonstration. The weighted monthly average sulfur content of coke used in manufacturing shall be calculated as follows:
              
              Weighted average percent sulfur = ∑(C1-n × SC1-n/100)/∑C1-n*100
              
              
                Where:
                
                Cn is the quantity of coke in shipment n in tons
                SCn is the percent sulfur content by weight of the coke in shipment n
                n is the number of shipments of coke in the calendar month
              
              
              (ii) Emission monitoring. Alcoa must test each shipment of coke for sulfur content using ASTM Method D6376 or an alternative method approved by the EPA Region 10. Written documentation from the coke supplier certifying the sulfur content is an approved alternative method.
              (2) Particulate matter (PM) emission limit. Starting November 10, 2014, the PM emissions from the anode bake furnaces stack must not exceed 0.01 grains per dry standard cubic foot of exhaust gas.

              § 52.2522
              Identification of plan-conditional approval.
              With the exceptions set forth below in this subpart, the Administrator approves West Virginia's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards.
              (a)-(f) [Reserved]
              (g) The Administrator approves West Virginia's November 22, 1995 SIP submittal for the Follansbee, West Virginia PM-10 nonattainment area as fulfilling the section 189(a)(1)(B) requirement for a demonstration that the plan is sufficient to attain the PM-10 NAAQS.
              (h) [Reserved]

              (i)(1) EPA is fully approving WVDEP's August 31, 2011 submittal, except for the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. Except for this narrow issue, EPA is approving all other portions of the submittal, including but not limited to, the remainder of section 2.66. In approving West Virginia State Rule 45CSR14 with regard to all other CAA and Federal regulatory SIP requirements for PSD applicable as of the August 31, 2011 SIP revision submission date, EPA is acknowledging that it is consistent with the “Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule” (Tailoring Rule), which was promulgated on June 3, 2010 (75 FR 31514). EPA is not finalizing its proposed approval of WVDEP's August 31, 2011 submittal with respect to the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. In light of a comment received on its July 31, 2012 proposed rule (77 FR 45302), EPA is reviewing West Virginia State Rule 45CSR14 to determine the extent to which its definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” satisfies the corresponding Federal definition, and will address this issue in a separate action.

              (2) EPA is also approving those portions of West Virginia's SIP submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 2007, April 3, 2008, October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 2012 which address the PSD-related requirements set forth in CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II) for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS, 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS, 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS, 2008 lead NAAQS, and 2008 ozone NAAQS, as well as CAA Section 110(a)(2)(C) and (J) for the 2008 lead NAAQS and 2008 ozone NAAQS, except for the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. EPA is not finalizing its July 31, 2012 proposed approval (77 FR 45302) of WVDEP's SIP submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 2007, April 3, 2008, October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 2012 submitted to meet the PSD-related infrastructure SIP obligations set forth at CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) with respect to the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. EPA will address this issue in a separate action.

              (j)(1) EPA is disapproving a narrow portion of West Virginia's August 31, 2011 submittal because it does not satisfy the requirement that emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 shall include gaseous emissions which condense to form particulate matter at ambient temperatures. This disapproval extends only to the lack of condensable emissions within the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant,” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66, and does not alter EPA's October 17, 2012 (77 FR 63736) approval of the remaining portions of West Virginia's August 2011 SIP submittal.

              (2) EPA is disapproving specific portions of West Virginia's infrastructure SIP submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 2007, April 3, 2008, October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 2012 which address certain obligations set forth at CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) relating to the West Virginia PSD permit program. Because West Virginia's definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” in 45CSR14 does not address condensables for PM2.5 and PM10 emissions, EPA is determining that West Virginia's infrastructure SIP submissions do not meet certain statutory and regulatory obligations relating to a PSD permit program set forth at CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) for the narrow issue of condensables as set forth in the following table.

              (k) EPA is conditionally approving two West Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted on July 1, 2014 and June 6, 2012 relating to revisions to 45CSR14 (Permits for Construction and Major Modification of Major Stationary Sources of Air Pollution for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration) for failure to include a significant monitoring concentration value (SMC) of zero micrograms per cubic meter for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The conditional approval is based upon a commitment from the State to submit an additional SIP revision with a revised regulation at 45CSR14-16.7.c which will incorporate a SMC value of zero micrograms per cubic meter for PM2.5 to address this discrepancy and to be consistent with federal requirements. If the State fails to meet its commitment by June 24, 2016, the approval is treated as a disapproval.

              (55) On January 28, 1985, Wisconsin submitted its Rothschild (Marathon County) SO2 plan, which contains emission limits for sources in the City of Rothschild and the Town of Weston, specifically for the Weyerhaeuser Paper Company and the Reed-Lignin Company, respectively. USEPA is approving NR 418.08 because this revision meets the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7501-7508. The Wisconsin SIP, however, contains additional existing requirements for SO2. Today's action on NR 418.08 has been integrated within Wisconsin's existing SIP regulations, and does not eliminate a source's obligation to comply with all existing SO2 SIP requirements. Specifically, today's action in no way affects the terms and conditions of a Federal Consent Decree entered into by USEPA and the Weyerhaeuser Company located in Rothschild, Wisconsin No. 89-C-0973-C (W.D. Wis., filed November 1, 1989). This Consent Decree resolves USEPA's enforcement action against Weyerhaeuser Company for violations of SIP rule NR 154.12(1) (now recodified as 418.08). In that Decree, Weyerhaeuser committed to comply with NR 154.12(1) by installing a desulfurization scrubber. August 15, 1989, the WDNR issued a construction permit to Weyerhaeuser which limit the combined emissions of Weyerhaeuser's acid plant and desulfurization scrubber to 28 pounds of SO2 per hour. The conditions and terms of this construction permit and of the Consent Decree remain federally enforceable. On May 9, 1987, 18 months past the effective date of USEPA's designation of Marathon County as a primary SO2 non-attainment area (October 9, 1985, (50 FR 41139)), a construction moratorium was imposed in Marathon County under section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Clean Air Act because the county did not have a USEPA approved plan which assured the attainment and maintenance of the SO2 NAAQS. However, USEPA final approval of Rothschild's SO2 SIP will lift the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban in Marathon County.

Companies producing or using the four compounds will no longer need to follow the VOC rules for these compounds. Section NR 400.02(162)(b) was added for the compound t-butyl acetate. It is not considered a VOC for emission limits and content requirements. T-butyl acetate will still be considered a VOC for the recordkeeping, emissions reporting, and inventory requirements. Wisconsin also added and modified sections of NR 424.05, its VOC control requirements for yeast manufacturing facilities. Wisconsin's requirements are the same as the federal requirements in the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for nutritional yeast manufacturing.

Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the Ozone portion of the State Implementation Plan depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements on:
              (1) Group III Control Techniques Guideline sources within 1 year after January 1st following the issuance of each Group III control technique guideline; and
              (2) Major (actual emissions equal or greater than 100 tons VOC per year) non-control technique guideline sources in accordance with the State's schedule contained in the 1982 Ozone SIP revision for Southeastern Wisconsin.

              § 52.2573
              General requirements.
              (a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide for public availability of emission data.
              (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
              (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
              (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
              (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of any stationary source in the Southeast Wisconsin AQCR subject to the following emission limiting regulation in the Wisconsin implementation plan shall comply with the applicable compliance schedule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section: Wisconsin Air Pollution Control Regulation NR 154.13.
              (2) (i) Compliance schedules. The owner or operator of any stationary source in the Southeast Wisconsin AQCR subject to NR 154.13 shall notify the Administrator no later than October 1, 1973, of his intent either to install necessary control systems per Wisconsin Air Pollution Control Regulation NR 154.13(2) or to switch to an exempt solvent per Wisconsin Air Pollution Control Regulation NR 154.13(3) to comply with the requirements of Wisconsin Air Pollution Control Regulation NR 154.13.
              (ii) Any owner or operator of a stationary source subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section who elects to comply with the requirements of NR 154.13 by installing a control system shall take the following actions with respect to the source no later than the specified dates.
              (a) November 1, 1973—Advertise for bids for purchase and/or construction of control system or purchase of requisite material for process modification sufficient to control hydrocarbon emissions from the source.
              (b) December 15, 1973—Award contracts or issued order for purchase and/or construction of control system or purchase of requisite material for process modification sufficient to control hydrocarbon emissions from the source.
              (c) April 15, 1974—Initiate onsite construction or installation of control system or process modification.
              (d) November 1, 1974—Complete on-site construction or installation of control system or process modification.
              (e) January 1, 1975—Achieve final compliance with Wisconsin Air Pollution Control Regulation NR 154.13.
              (iii) Any owner or operator of a stationary source subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, who elects to comply with the requirements of Wisconsin Air Pollution Control Regulation NR 154.13 by switching to an exempt solvent, shall take the following actions with respect to the source no later than the dates specified.
              (a) April 1, 1974—Begin testing exempt solvents.
              (b) June 1, 1974—Issue purchase orders for exempt solvents.

              (d) January 1, 1975—Achieve full compliance with Wisconsin Air Pollution Control Regulation NR 154.13.
              (iv) Any owner or operator subject to a compliance schedule above shall certify to the Administrator, within five days after the deadline for each increment of progress in that schedule, whether or not the increment has been met.

              (3) (i) None of the above paragraphs shall apply to a source which is presently in compliance with applicable regulations and which has certified such compliance to the Administrator by October 1, 1973. The Administrator may request whatever supporting information he considers necessary for proper certification.
              
              (ii) Any compliance schedule adopted by the State and approved by the Administrator shall satisfy the requirements of this paragraph for the affected source.
              (iii) Any owner or operator subject to a compliance schedule in this paragraph may submit to the Administrator no later than October 1, 1973, a proposed alternative compliance schedule. No such compliance schedule may provide for final compliance after the final compliance date in the applicable compliance schedule of this paragraph. If promulgated by the Administrator, such schedule shall satisfy the requirements of this paragraph for the affected source.
              (4) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Administrator from promulgating a separate schedule for any source to which the application of the compliance schedule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section fails to satisfy the requirements of §§ 51.261 and 51.262(a) of this chapter.

              § 52.2584
              Control strategy; Particulate matter.
              (a) Part D—Disapproval—USEPA disapproves Regulation NR 154.11(7)(b) of Wisconsin Administrative Code (RACT Requirements for Coking Operations), which is part of the control strategy to attain and maintain the standards for particulate matter, because it does not contain an enforceable RACT-level numerical visible emission limitation for charging operations.

              (b) Approval—On April 30, 1988 and March 30, 1990, the State of Wisconsin submitted committal SIPs for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 micrometers (PM10) for the Group II areas within the Cities of DePere, Madison, Milwaukee, Superior, and Waukesha. This committal SIP meets all of the requirements identified in the July 1, 1987, promulgation of the SIP requirements for PM10.
              (c) Approval—On August 1, 2013, the State of Wisconsin submitted a revision to their Particulate Matter State Implementation Plan. The submittal established transportation conformity “Conformity” criteria and procedures related to interagency consultation, and enforceability of certain transportation related control and mitigation measures.

              (d) Approval—On April 22, 2014, EPA approved the 2006 24-Hour PM2.5 maintenance plan for the Milwaukee-Racine nonattainment area (Milwaukee, Racine and Waukesha Counties), as submitted on June 8, 2012. The maintenance plan establishes 2020 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the Milwaukee-Racine area of 2.33 tons per winter day 1 (tpwd) and 2.16 tpwd direct PM2.5 and 32.62 tpwd and 28.69 tpwd NOX for the years 2020 and 2025, respectively.

              (e) Approval—On April 22, 2014, EPA approved the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 comprehensive emissions inventories for the Milwaukee-Racine area (Milwaukee, Racine and Waukesha Counties). Wisconsin's 2006 NOX, directly emitted PM2.5, SO2, VOC, as well as the 2007 supplemental ammonia emissions inventory satisfies the emission inventory requirements of section 172(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act for the Milwaukee-Racine area.
              (f) Approval—On December 23, 2015, the State of Wisconsin submitted a revision to its State Implementation Plan for the Milwaukee-Racine-Waukesha (Milwaukee), Wisconsin 2006 24-Hour Particulate Matter Maintenance Plan. The submittal established new Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (MVEB) for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) for the years 2020 and 2025. The VOC MVEBs for the Milwaukee area are now: 18.274 tons per day for 2020 and 13.778 tons per day for the year 2025.

              § 52.2585
              Control strategy: Ozone.
              (a) Disapproval—On November 6, 1986, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted as a proposed revision to the State's ozone State Implementation Plan a site-specific reasonably available control technology determination for a miscellaneous metal parts and products dip coating line. This line is located at the Gehl facility in Washington County, Wisconsin. In a May 31, 1988 (53 FR 19806), notice of proposed rulemaking, United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed to disapprove this site-specific revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan for ozone.
              (b) Disapproval—On August 22, 1986, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a proposed revision to its ozone State Implementation Plan consisting of a site-specific reasonably available control technology determination for two miscellaneous metal parts and products spray coatings lines. These operations are located at the General Electric Company, Medical Systems facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an area which has been designated as nonattainment for ozone, pursuant to section 107 of the Clean Air Act and 40 Code of Federal Regulations, part 81, § 81.350.
              (c) [Reserved]
              (d) Approval—On November 15, 1992, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to the development of a process for assessing conformity of any federally-funded transportation and other federally funded projects in the nonattainment area.
              (e) Approval—On January 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for the 1990 base year inventory. The inventory was submitted by the State of Wisconsin to satisfy Federal requirements under section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (the Act), as a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) for all areas in Wisconsin designated nonattainment, classified marginal to extreme. These areas include counties of Walworth, Door, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, Sheboygan, and the six county Milwaukee area (counties of Washington, Ozaukee, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Racine, and Kenosha).
              (f) Approval—The Administrator approves the incorporation of the photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by Wisconsin on November 15, 1993, into the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan. This submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f) which requires the State to provide for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical assessment monitoring stations (PAMS).

              (g) Approval—On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for forecasting VMT in the severe ozone nonattainment area of southeastern Wisconsin and demonstrated that Transportation Control Measures would not be necessary to offset growth in emissions.
              
              (h) Approval—On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for forecasting VMT in the severe ozone nonattainment area of southeastern Wisconsin and demonstrated that Transportation Control Measures would not be necessary to meet the 15 percent Rate-of-Progress milestone.

              (i) Approval—EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen (NOX) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general conformity exemptions for the moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas within Wisconsin as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval also covers the exemption of transportation and general conformity requirements of section 176(c) for the Door and Walworth marginal ozone nonattainment areas. Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the results of the final ozone attainment demonstration expected to be submitted in mid-1997. The approval will be modified if the final attainment demonstration demonstrates that NOX emission controls are needed in any of the nonattainment areas to attain the ozone standard in the Lake Michigan Ozone Study modeling domain.
              (j) Approval—On June 14, 1995, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation and enforcement of the Federal transportation conformity requirements at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 51, subpart T—Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act.

              (k) Approval—On December 15, 1995, and May 15, 1996, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted requests to redesignate Walworth County and Sheboygan and Kewaunee Counties, respectively, from nonattainment to attainment for ozone. The State also submitted maintenance plans as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7505a. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plans include attainment emission inventories for NOX and VOC, demonstrations of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2007 for NOX and VOC, plans to verify continued attainment, and contingency plans. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS, determined to be caused by local sources is monitored, Wisconsin will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained in the contingency plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is recorded, the State will notify EPA and review the data for quality assurance. A plan to analyze the violation, including an analysis of meteorological conditions, will be submitted within 60 days to EPA-Region 5 for approval. Within 14 months of the violation, Wisconsin will complete and public notice the analysis and submit it to EPA-Region 5 for review. If the analysis shows that local sources caused the violation, Wisconsin will implement the contingency measures within 24 months after the violation. The contingency measures to be implemented in Walworth County are Stage II vapor recovery and non-Control Technology Guideline (non-CTG) Reasonably available control technology (RACT) limits. Contingency measures to be implemented in either Kewaunee or Sheboygan County are lower major source applicability thresholds for industrial sources and new gasoline standards which will lower VOC emissions. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act, respectively.

              (l) Wisconsin's November 15, 1994 request for a temporary delay of the ozone attainment date for Manitowoc County from 1996 to 2007 and suspension of the automatic reclassification of Manitowoc County to serious nonattainment for ozone is approved, based on Wisconsin's demonstration through photochemical grid modeling that transport from upwind areas makes it “practicably impossible” for the County to attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard by its original attainment date.
              (m) Approval—On July 10, 1996, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a request to waive the Oxide of Nitrogen requirements for transportation conformity in the Milwaukee and Manitowoc ozone nonattainment areas.
              (n) Approval—On September 8, 2000, Wisconsin submitted a revision to the ozone maintenance plan for the Walworth County area. The revision consists of allocating a portion of the Walworth County area's Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) safety margin to the transportation conformity Motor Vehicle Emission Budget (MVEB). The MVEB for transportation conformity purposes for the Walworth County area are now: 5.39 tons per day of VOC emissions and 7.20 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen emissions for the year 2007. This approval only changes the VOC transportation conformity MVEB for Walworth County.
              (o) Approval—On December 11, 1997, Wisconsin submitted a post-1996 Rate Of Progress plan for the Milwaukee-Racine ozone nonattainment area as a requested revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan. Supplements to the December 11, 1997 plan were submitted on August 5, 1999, January 31, 2000, March 3, 2000, and February 21, 2001 establishing the post-1996 ROP plan for the Milwaukee-Racine ozone nonattainment area. This plan reduces ozone precursor emissions by 9 percent from 1990 baseline emissions by November 15, 1999.
              (p) Approval—On December 27, 2000, Wisconsin submitted a one-hour ozone attainment demonstration plan as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP). Supplements to the December 27, 2001 plan were submitted on May 28, 2001, June 6, 2001, and August 29, 2001. This plan includes a modeled demonstration of attainment, rules for the reduction of ozone precursor emissions, a plan to reduce ozone precursor emissions by three percent per year from 2000 to 2007, an analysis of reasonably achievable control measures, an analysis of transportation conformity budgets, a revision of the waiver for emission of oxides of nitrogen, and commitments to conduct a mid-course review of the area's attainment status and to use the new MOBILE6 emissions model.

              (q) Approval—On January 28, 2003, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a request to redesignate Manitowoc and Door Counties to attainment. Additional information was submitted on February 5, 2003 and February 27, 2003. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. The 2013 motor vehicle emission budgets for Door County are 0.74 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOC) per day and 1.17 tons of oxides of nitrogen (NOX) per day. The 2013 motor vehicle emission budgets for Manitowoc County are 1.89 tons of VOC per day and 3.59 tons of NOX per day.
              (r) Approval—On January 28, 2003, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a 1999 periodic emissions inventory for the Milwaukee-Racine area. Additional information was submitted on February 5, 2003 and February 27, 2003. The inventory meets the requirement of section 182(2)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990.

              (s) Approval—On January 31, 2003, Wisconsin submitted a revision to the ozone attainment plan for the Milwaukee severe ozone area and maintenance plan for Sheboygan County. These plans revised 2007 motor vehicle emission inventories and 2007 Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (MVEB) recalculated using the emissions factor model MOBILE6. The plan also included a new 2012 projected MVEB for the Sheboygan County.

              (u) Approval—On June 12, 2007, Wisconsin submitted a request to redesignate Kewaunee County to attainment of the 8-hour ozone standard. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted an ozone maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Part of the section 175A maintenance plan includes a contingency plan. The ozone maintenance plan establishes 2012 motor vehicle emissions budgets for Kewaunee County of 0.43 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 0.80 tons per day of nitrogen oxIdes (NOX) and 2018 motor vehicle emissions budgets for Kewaunee County of 0.32 tons per day of VOCs and 0.47 tons per day of NOX.
              (v) On July 28, 2008, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources requested that EPA find that the Milwaukee-Racine, WI nonattainment area, attained the revoked 1-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). After review of this submission, EPA approves this request.

              (w) Approval—On June 12, 2007, Wisconsin submitted 2005 VOC and NOX base year emissions inventories for the Manitowoc County and Door County areas. Wisconsin's 2005 inventories satisfy the base year emissions inventory requirements of section 172(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act for the Manitowoc County and Door County areas under the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.

              (x) Approval—On September 11, 2009, Wisconsin submitted requests to redesignate the Manitowoc County and Door County areas to attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. As part of the redesignation requests, the State submitted maintenance plans as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plans include contingency plans and an obligation to submit subsequent maintenance plan revisions in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone maintenance plans also establish 2012 and 2020 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the areas. The 2012 MVEBs for the Manitowoc County and Door County areas are 1.76 tons per day (tpd) for VOC and 3.76 tpd for NOX, and 0.78 tpd for VOC and 1.55 tpd for NOX, respectively. The 2020 MVEBs for the Manitowoc County and Door County areas are 1.25 tpd for VOC and 1.86 tpd for NOX, and 0.53 tpd for VOC and 0.74 tpd for NOX, respectively.
              (y) Determination of attainment. EPA has determined, as of March 1, 2011 that the Milwaukee-Racine, WI and Sheboygan, WI areas have attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. These determinations suspend the requirements for these areas to submit attainment demonstrations and associated reasonably available control measures (RACM), reasonable further progress plans (RFP), contingency measures, and other State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions related to attainment of the standard for as long as the areas continue to attain the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. These determinations also stay the requirement for EPA to promulgate attainment demonstration and RFP Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) for these areas.
              (z) Approval—Wisconsin submitted 2005 VOC and NOX emissions inventories for the Milwaukee-Racine and Sheboygan areas on September 11, 2009, and supplemented the submittal on November 16, 2011. Wisconsin's 2005 inventories satisfy the emissions inventory requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act for the Milwaukee-Racine and Sheboygan areas under the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.

              (aa) Approval—On September 11, 2009, Wisconsin submitted a request to redesignate the Milwaukee-Racine area to attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. The state supplemented this submittal on November 16, 2011. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone maintenance plan also establishes 2015 and 2022 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the area. The 2015 MVEBs for the Milwaukee-Racine area is 21.08 tpd for VOC and 51.22 tpd for NOX. The 2022 MVEBs for the Milwaukee-Racine area is 15.98 tpd for VOC and 31.91 tpd for NOX.
              (bb) Approval—On August 1, 2013, the State of Wisconsin submitted a revision to their Ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal established transportation conformity “Conformity” criteria and procedures related to interagency consultation, and enforceability of certain transportation related control and mitigation measures.

              (cc) Approval—On January 16, 2015, the State of Wisconsin submitted a revision to its State Implementation Plan for Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. The submittal established new Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (MVEB) for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) for the year 2015. The MVEBs for Sheboygan County are now: 1.972 tons per day of VOC emissions and 4.435 tons per day of NOX emissions for the year 2015.
              (dd) On November 14, 2014, Wisconsin submitted 2011 volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen emission inventories for the Sheboygan County and Wisconsin portion (Kenosha area) of the Chicago-Naperville, Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin nonattainment areas for the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standard as a revision of the Wisconsin state implementation plan. The documented emission inventories are approved as a revision of the State's implementation plan.

              (ee) Approval—On January 16, 2015, the State of Wisconsin submitted a revision to its State Implementation Plan for Kenosha County, Wisconsin. The submittal established new Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (MVEB) for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) for the year 2015. The MVEBs for Kenosha County nonattainment area are now: 1.994 tons per day of VOC emissions and 4.397 tons per day of NOX emissions for the year 2015.

              (ff) Approval—On April 17, 2017, as supplemented on January 23, 2018, Wisconsin submitted a revision to its State Implementation Plan along with a prior submission on August 15, 2016, to satisfy the emissions statement, emission inventory, reasonable further progress (RFP), RFP contingency measure, oxides of nitrogen (NOX) reasonably available control technology (RACT), motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M), and transportation conformity requirements for the Wisconsin portion of the Chicago area for the 2008 ozone NAAQS moderate nonattainment plan. These elements of the plan meet the requirements of section 110 and part D of the CAA for the Wisconsin portion of the Chicago area, which was reclassified on May 4, 2016, as moderate nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. The April 17, 2017, submittal as supplemented on January 23, 2018, also established new Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (MVEB) for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and NOX for the years 2017 and 2018. The MVEBs for the Wisconsin portion of the Chicago 2008 ozone NAAQS nonattainment area, which is the portion of Kenosha County inclusive and east of Interstate 94, are now: 1.56 tons per summer day of VOC emissions and 3.05 tons per summer day of NOX emissions for the year 2017, and 1.44 tons per summer day of VOC emissions and 2.75 tons per summer day of NOX emissions for the year 2018.
              (gg) Disapproval—EPA is disapproving Wisconsin's August 15, 2016, ozone redesignation request for the Wisconsin portion of the Chicago-Naperville, IL-IN-WI nonattainment area for the 2008 ozone standard. EPA is also disapproving Wisconsin's maintenance plan and motor vehicle emission budgets submitted with the redesignation request.
              (hh) Approval—On July 19, 2018, Wisconsin submitted a SIP revision certifying that the existing SIP-approved nonattainment new source review regulations fully satisfy the nonattainment new source review requirements for marginal and moderate ozone nonattainment areas for the 2008 ozone NAAQS.

              § 52.2592
              Review of new sources and modifications.

              Disapproval—On May 12, 2011, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a proposed revision to its State Implementation Plan to update its rules to match the 2008 New Source Review Implementation Rule for PM2.5. The State supplemented the submittal on March 5, 2012. EPA determined that this submittal was not approvable because the revisions did not explicitly identify the precursors to PM2.5 and did not contain the prescribed language to ensure that gases that condense to form PM, known as condensables, are regulated within PM2.5 and PM10 emission limits.

              (a) Approval. Wisconsin submitted its regional haze plan to EPA on January 18, 2012, supplemented on June 7, 2012. The Wisconsin regional haze plan meets the requirements of Clean Air Act section 169B and the Regional Haze Rule in 40 CFR 51.308.
              (b) Approval. Wisconsin submitted its five-year progress report on March 17, 2017. The Progress Report meets the requirements of Clean Air Act sections 169A and 169B and the Regional Haze Rule in 40 CFR 51.308.

              Control strategy and regulations: Ozone.
              (a) Determination of attainment. The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Upper Green River Basin Area, WY 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment area has attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Upper Green River Basin Area, WY nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
              (b) [Reserved]

              On June 2, 2017, the State of Wyoming submitted a maintenance plan for the Sheridan PM10 nonattaiment area and requested that this area be redesignated to attainment for the PM10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The redesignation request and maintenance plan satisfy all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.

At the end of each operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current operating day and the previous 29 successive operating days.

              (B) At the end of each calendar year, the owner/operator shall calculate the annual average SO2 emission rate in lb/MMBtu across Laramie River Station Units 1 and 2 as the sum of the SO2 annual mass emissions (pounds) divided by the sum of the annual heat inputs (MMBtu). For Laramie River Station Units 1 and 2, the owner/operator shall calculate the annual mass emissions for SO2 and the annual heat input in accordance with 40 CFR part 75 for each unit.
              (C) An hourly average SO2 and/or NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 75, is acquired by both the pollutant concentration monitor (SO2 and/or NOX) and the diluent monitor (O2 or CO2).
              (D) Data reported to meet the requirements of this section shall not include data substituted using the missing data substitution procedures of subpart D of 40 CFR part 75, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of 40 CFR part 75.
              (2) For all Trona Plant BART units:
              (i) CEMS. At all times after the compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate, and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR part 60, to accurately measure NOX, diluent, and stack gas volumetric flow rate from each unit, including the CEMS quality assurance requirements in appendix F of 40 CFR part 60. The CEMS shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit.
              (ii) Method. (A) For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 60. At the end of each operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current operating day and the previous 29 successive operating days.
              (B) An hourly average NOX emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 60, is acquired by both the pollutant concentration monitor (NOX) and the diluent monitor (O2 or CO2).
              (f) Compliance determinations for particulate matter. Compliance with the particulate matter emission limit for each BART unit shall be determined from annual performance stack tests. Within 60 days of the compliance deadline specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and on at least an annual basis thereafter, the owner/operator of each unit shall conduct a stack test on each unit to measure particulate emissions using EPA Method 5, 5B, 5D, or 17, as appropriate, in 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A. A test shall consist of three runs, with each run at least 120 minutes in duration and each run collecting a minimum sample of 60 dry standard cubic feet. Results shall be reported in lb/MMBtu. In addition to annual stack tests, the owner/operator shall monitor particulate emissions for compliance with the BART emission limits in accordance with the applicable Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) plan developed and approved by the State in accordance with 40 CFR part 64.
              (g) Recordkeeping. The owner/operator shall maintain the following records for at least five years:

              General requirements.
              (a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met, since section 2.4 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of Atmospheric Pollution could, in some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, section 2.4 is disapproved.

              (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
              (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
              (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
              (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

              § 52.2731
              Control strategy and regulations: Sulfur oxides.
              (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since the Puerto Rico plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the national standards for sulfur oxides in the areas of Aguirre, Barceloneta, Trujillo Alto-Dorado and Ensenada.
              (b) Article 6, as submitted to EPA on January 3, 1975, of the Puerto Rico Regulations for Control of Atmospheric Pollution, as it applies to those areas listed in paragraph (a) of this section is disapproved for the following facilities: Puerto RicoWater Resources Authority—Aguirre Complex, Abbott, Merck and Company, Bristol Meyers, Pfizer, Union Carbide, Upjohn, located in the Barceloneta air basin, and Central Guanica, located in the Aquada air basin. Accordingly, these sources, with the exception of the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority—Aguirre Complex, are required to conform to the sulfur in fuel limitations contained in Article 6 of the Puerto Rico implementation plan as submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972.

              Review of new sources and modifications.
              (a)-(d) [Reserved]
              (e) The requirements of 40 CFR 51.18(h) are not met since section 206-30 of Chapter 9, Title 12 of the Virgin Islands' Code does not provide that information submitted by the owner or operator and the agency's analysis including its proposed approval/disapproval decision, be made available for public comment for a period of 30 days prior to final action.
              (f) Subsection 206-30(f)(6) of section 206-30 of Chapter 9, Title 12 of the Virgin Islands' Code is disapproved since sources of minor significance are not identified in the regulation. Accordingly, all sources not listed in subsection 206-30 (f)(1) through (f)(5) will be subject to review in accordance with the requirements of section 206-30.
              (g) Regulation for review of new sources and modifications.
              (1) This requirement is applicable to any stationary source subject to review under section 206-30 of Chapter 9, Title 12 of the Virgin Islands' Code or 40 CFR 52.2775(f).
              (2) Within 30 days after receipt of an application, the Commissioner of the Department of Conservation and Cultural Affairs, will notify the public, by prominent advertisement in the local news media, of the opportunity for public comment on the information submitted by the owner or operator.
              (i) Such information, together with the Commissioner's analysis of the effect of the construction or modification on air quality including the Commissioner's proposed approval or disapproval, will be available in at least one location in the affected region.
              (ii) Written public comments submitted within 30 days of the date such information is made available will be considered by the Commissioner in making his final decision on the application.
              (iii) The Commissioner will make a final decision on the application within 30 days after the close of the public comment period. The Commissioner will notify the applicant in writing of his approval, conditional approval, or disapproval of the application and will set forth his reasons for conditional approval or disapproval.

              (iv) A copy of the notice required by paragraph (h)(2) of this section shall also be sent to the Administrator through the appropriate regional office, and to all other State and local air pollution control agencies having jurisdiction in the region in which such new or modified installation will be located. The notice shall also be sent to any other agency in the region having responsibility for implementing the procedures required under this section.

              Control strategy for sulfur oxides.
              (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since there has not been a satisfactory demonstration that the Virgin Islands plan provides for the attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards for sulfur oxides on the island of St. Croix.
              (b) The following parts of regulation 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26, “Sulfur Compounds Emission Control,” as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976 are approved:
              (1) The entire regulation as it applies to the islands of St. Thomas and St. John.
              (2) The entire regulation as it applies to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority's Christiansted Power Plant on the island of St. Croix.
              (3) The entire regulation excluding subsection (a)(2) as it applies to the remaining sources on the island of St. Croix.
              Subsection (a)(2) of the regulation is not approved as it applies to the remaining sources on St. Croix because of the inadequacy of the control strategy demonstration noted in paragraph (a) of this section. Accordingly, all sources on St. Croix with the exception of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority's Christiansted Power Plant are required to conform to the sulfur-in-fuel-oil limitations contained in 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26 as originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972.
              (c) Reference to “Section (a)(2)” in subsection (d) of 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26, as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976, refers to the following approved limitations: (1) For the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, subsection (a)(2) of section 204-26 as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976; (2) for the island of St. Croix, subsection (a)(2) of section 204-26 as originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972 and approved by EPA on May 31, 1972.

              § 52.2781
              Visibility protection.
              (a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met, because the plan does not include approvable procedures for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
              (b)-(c) [Reserved]
              (d) Regional Haze Plan for Virgin Islands National Park. The regional haze plan for the Virgin Islands consists of a Federal Implementation Plan entitled: “FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR REGIONAL HAZE FOR THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS.” The applicable requirements consist of:
              (1) Applicability. This section addresses Clean Air Act requirements and EPA's rules to prevent and remedy future and existing man-made impairment of visibility in the mandatory Class I area of the Virgin Islands National Park through a Regional Haze Program. This section applies to the owner and operator of HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a petroleum refinery located on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
              (2) Definitions. Terms not defined below shall have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act or EPA's regulations implementing the Clean Air Act. For purposes of this section:NO X means nitrogen oxides.
              
                Owner/operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a facility or source identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
              
                PM means particulate matter.
              
                Process unit means any collection of structures and/or equipment that processes, assembles, applies, blends, or otherwise uses material inputs to produce or store an intermediate or a completed product. A single stationary source may contain more than one process unit, and a process unit may contain more than one emissions unit. For a petroleum refinery, there are several categories of process units that could include: Those that separate and/or distill petroleum feedstocks; those that change molecular structures; petroleum treating processes; auxiliary facilities, such as steam generators and hydrogen production units; and those that load, unload, blend or store intermediate or completed products.
              
                SO 2 means sulfur dioxide.
              
                Startup means the setting in operation of an affected facility for any purpose.
              (3) Reasonable Progress Measures. On June 7, 2011, EPA and HOVENSA entered into a Consent Decree (CD) in the U.S. District Court for the Virgin Islands to resolve alleged Clean Air Act violations at its St. Croix, Virgin Islands facility. The CD requires HOVENSA, among other things, to achieve emission limits and install new pollution controls pursuant to a schedule for compliance. The measures required by the CD reduce emissions of NOX by 5,031 tons per year (tpy) and SO2 by 3,460 tpy. The emission limitations, pollution controls, schedules for compliance, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions of the HOVENSA CD constitute an element of the long term strategy and address the reasonable progress provisions of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1). Should the existing federally enforceable HOVENSA CD be revised, EPA will reevaluate, and if necessary, revise the FIP after public notice and comment.
              (4) HOVENSA requirement for notification. HOVENSA must notify EPA 60 days in advance of startup and resumption of operation of refinery process units at the HOVENSA, St. Croix, Virgin Islands facility. HOVENSA shall submit such notice to the Director of the Clean Air and Sustainability Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2, 290 Broadway, 25th Floor, New York, New York, 10007-1866. HOVENSA's notification to EPA that it intends to startup refinery process units must include information regarding those emission units that will be operating, including unit design parameters such as heat input and hourly emissions, information on potential to emit limitations, pollution controls and control efficiencies, and schedules for compliance. EPA will revise the FIP as necessary, after public notice and comment, in accordance with regional haze requirements including the “reasonable progress” provisions in 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1). HOVENSA will be required to install any controls that are required by the revised FIP as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than 5 years after the effective date of the revised FIP.

              § 52.2782
              Small business technical and environmental compliance assistance program.
              On January 15, 1993, the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources submitted a plan to establish and implement a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program for incorporation in the Virgin Islands state implementation plan. This plan meets the requirements of section 507 of the Clean Air Act, and the U.S. Virgin Islands must implement the program as approved by EPA.

              1. Definitions.
              
              1.1 Concentration Measurement System. The total equipment required for the continuous determination of SO2 gas concentration in a given source effluent.
              1.2 Span. The value of sulfur dioxide concentration at which the measurement system is set to produce the maximum data display output. For the purposes of this method, the span shall be set at the expected maximum sulfur dioxide concentration except as specified under section 5.2, Field Test for Accuracy.
              1.3 Accuracy (Relative). The degree of correctness with which the measurement system yields the value of gas concentration of a sample relative to the value given by a defined reference method. This accuracy is expressed in terms of error which is the difference between the paired concentration measurements expressed as a percentage of the mean reference value.
              1.4 Calibration Error. The difference between the pollutant concentration indicated by the measurement system and the known concentration of the test gas mixture.
              1.5 Zero Drift. The change in measurement system output over a stated period of time of normal continuous operation when the pollutant concentration at the time for the measurement is zero.
              1.6 Calibration Drift. The change in measurement system output over a stated period of time of normal continuous operation when the pollutant concentration at the time of the measurement is the same known upscale value.
              1.7 Response Time. The time interval from a step change in pollutant concentration at the input to the measurement system to the time at which 95 percent of the corresponding final value is reached as displayed on the measurement system data presentation device.
              1.8 Operational Period. A minimum period of time over which a measurement system is expected to operate within certain performance specifications without unscheduled maintenance, repair or adjustment.
              1.9 Reference Method. The reference method for determination of SO2 emissions shall be Method 8 as delineated in Part 60 of this chapter. The analytical and computational portions of Method 8 as they relate to determination of sulfuric acid mist and sulfur trioxide, as well as isokinetic sampling, may be omitted from the overall test procedure.
              2. Principle and Applicability.
              
              2.1 Principle. Gases are continuously sampled in the stack emissions and analyzed for sulfur dioxide by a continuously operating emission measurement system. Performance specifications for the continuous measurement systems are given. Test procedures are given to determine the capability of the measurement systems to conform to the performance specifications. Sampling may include either the extractive or nonextractive (in-situ) approach.
              2.2 Applicability. The performance specifications are given for continuous sulfur dioxide measurement systems applied to nonferrous smelters.
              3. Apparatus.
              
              3.1 Calibration Gas Mixture. Mixture of a known concentrations of sulfur dioxide in oxygen-free nitrogen. Nominal volumetric concentrations of 50 percent and 90 percent of span are recommended. The mixture of 90 percent of span is to be used to set and to check the span and is referred to as the span gas. The gas mixtures shall be analyzed by the Reference Method at least two weeks prior to use or demonstrated to be accurate and stable by an alternate method subject to approval of the Administrator.
              3.2 Zero Gas. A gas containing less than 1 ppm sulfur dioxide.

              5. Performance Specification Test Procedures.
              
              The following test procedures shall be used to determine compliance with the requirements of paragraph 4:
              5.1 Calibration test.
              
              5.1.1 Analyze each calibration gas mixture (50 percent, 90 percent) for sulfur dioxide by the Reference method and record the results on the example sheet shown in Figure D-1. This step may be omitted for nonextractive monitors where dynamic calibration gas mixtures are not used (see section 5.1.2).
              5.1.2 Set up and calibrate the complete measurement system according to the manufacturer's written instructions. This may be accomplished either in the laboratory or in the field. Make a series of five nonconsecutive readings with span gas mixtures alternately at each concentration (example, 50 percent, 90 percent, 50 percent, 90 percent, 50 percent). For nonextractive measurement systems, this test may be performed using procedures specified by the manufacturer and two or more calibration gases whose concentrations are certified by the manufacturer and differ by a factor of two or more. Convert the measurement system output readings to ppm and record the results on the example sheet shown in Figure D-2.
              5.2 Field Test for Accuracy (Relative), Zero Drift and Calibration Drift. Install and operate the measurement system in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions and drawings as follows:
              5.2.1 Conditioning Period. Offset the zero setting at least 10 percent of span so that negative zero drift may be quantified. Operate the system for an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this period the system should measure the SO2 content of the effluent in a normal operational manner.
              5.2.2 Operational Test Period. Operate the system for an additional 168-hour period. The system shall be monitoring the source effluent at all times when not being zeroed, calibrated or backpurged.
              5.2.2.1 Field Test for Accuracy (Relative). The analyzer output for the following test shall be maintained between 20 percent and 90 percent of span. It is recommended that a calibrated gas mixture be used to verify the span setting utilized. During this 168-hour test period, make a minimum of nine (9) SO2 concentration measurements using the Reference Method with a sampling period of one hour. If a measurement system operates across the stack or a portion of it, the Reference Method test shall make a four-point traverse over the measurement system operating path. Isokinetic sampling and analysis for SO3 and H2 SO4 mist are not required. For measurement systems employing extractive sampling, place the measurement system and the Reference Method probe tips adjacent to each other in the duct. One test will consist of two simultaneous samples with not less than two analyses on each sample. Record the test data and measurement system concentrations on the example sheet shown in Figure D-3.
              5.2.2.2 Field Test for Zero Drift and Calibration Drift. Determine the values given by zero and span gas SO2 concentrations at 2-hour intervals until 15 sets of data are obtained. Alternatively, for nonextractive measurement systems, determine the values given by an electrically or mechanically produced zero condition, and by inserting a certified calibration gas concentration equivalent to not less than 20 percent of span, into the measurement system. Record these readings on the example sheet shown in Figure D-4. These 2-hour periods need not be consecutive but may not overlap. If the analyzer span is set at the expected maximum concentration for the tests performed under section 5.2.2, then the zero and span determinations to be made under this paragraph may be made concurrent with the tests under section 5.2.2.1. Zero and calibration corrections and adjustments are allowed only at 24-hour intervals (except as required under section 5.2.2) or at such shorter intervals as the manufacturer's written instructions specify. Automatic corrections made by the measurement system without operator intervention or initiation are allowable at any time. During the entire 168-hour test period, record the values given by zero and span gas SO2 concentrations before and after adjustment at 24-hour intervals in the example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
              5.3 Field Test for Response Time.
              
              5.3.1 This test shall be accomplished using the entire measurement system as installed including sample transport lines if used. Flow rates, line diameters, pumping rates, pressures (do not allow the pressurized calibration gas to change the normal operating pressure in the sample line), etc., shall be at the nominal values for normal operation as specified in the manufacturer's written instructions. In the case of cyclic analyzers, the response time test shall include one cycle.
              5.3.2 Introduce a zero concentration of SO2 into the measurement system sampling interface or as close to the sampling interface as possible. When the system output reading has stabilized, switch quickly to a known concentration of SO2 at 70 to 90 percent of span. Record the time from concentration switching to final stable response. After the system response has stabilized at the upper level, switch quickly to a zero concentration of SO2. Record the time from concentration switching to final stable response. Alternatively, for nonextractive monitors, a calibration gas concentration equivalent to 20 percent of span or more may be switched into and out of the sample path and response times recorded. Perform this test sequence three (3) times. For each test record the results on the example sheet shown in Figure D-6.
              6. Calculations, Data Analysis and Reporting.

              6.2 Data Analysis and Reporting.
              
              6.2.1 Accuracy (Relative). For each of the nine reference method testing periods, determine the average sulfur dioxide concentration reported by the continuous measurement system. These average concentrations shall be determined from the measurement system data recorded under section 5.2.2.1 by integrating the pollutant concentrations over each of the time intervals concurrent with each reference method test, then dividing by the cumulative time of each applicable reference method testing period. Before proceeding to the next step, determine the basis (wet or dry) of the measurement system data and reference method test data concentrations.
              If the bases are not consistent, apply a moisture correction to either the referenced method concentrations or the measurement system concentrations, as appropriate. Determine the correction factor by moisture tests concurrent with the reference method testing periods. Report the moisture test method and the correction procedure employed. For each of the nine test runs, subtract the Reference Method test concentrations from the continuous monitoring system average concentrations. Using these data, compute the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval using equations D-1 and D-2. Accuracy is reported as the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval expressed as a percentage of the mean reference method value. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-3.
              6.2.2 Calibration Error. Using the data from section 5.1 of this appendix, subtract the measured SO2 value determined under section 5.1.1 (Figure D-1) from the value shown by the measurement system for each of the 5 readings at each concentration measured under section 5.1.2 (Figure D-2). Calculate the mean of these difference values and the 95 percent confidence intervals according to equations D-1 and D-2. The calibration error is reported as the sum of absolute value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval as a percentage of each respective calibration gas concentration. Use example sheet shown in Figure D-2.
              6.2.3 Zero Drift (2-hour). Using the zero concentration values measured each two hours during the field test, calculate the differences between consecutive two-hour readings expressed in ppm. Calculate the mean difference and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. Report the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean value and the confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use example sheet shown in Figure D-4.
              6.2.4 Zero Drift (24-hour). Using the zero concentration values measured every 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences between the zero point after zero adjustment and the zero value 24 hours later just prior to zero adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these points and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. Report the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
              6.2.5 Calibration Drift (2-hour). Using the calibration values obtained at two-hour intervals during the field test, calculate the differences between consecutive two-hour readings expressed as ppm. These values should be corrected for the corresponding zero drift during that two-hour period. Calculate the mean and confidence interval of these corrected difference values using Equations D-1 and D-2. Do not use the differences between non-consecutive readings. Report the calibration drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-4.
              6.2.6 Calibration Drift (24-hour). Using the calibration values measured every 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences between the calibration concentration reading after zero and calibration adjustment and the calibration concentration reading 24 hours later after zero adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval using equations D-1 and D-2. Report the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
              6.2.7 Response Time. Using the charts from section 5.3 of this Appendix, calculate the time interval from concentration switching to 95 percent to the final stable value for all upscale and downscale tests. Report the mean of the three upscale test times and the mean of the three downscale test times. For nonextractive instruments using a calibration gas cell to determine response time, the observed times shall be extrapolated to 90 percent of full scale response time. For example, if the observed time for a 20 percent of span gas cell is one minute, this would be equivalent to a 41/2-minute response time when extrapolated to 90 percent of span. The two average times should not differ by more than 15 percent of the slower time. Report the slower time as the system response time. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-6.
              6.2.8 Operational Period. During the 168-hour performance and operational test period, the measurement system shall not require any corrective maintenance, repair, replacement, or adjustment other than that clearly specified as required in the operation and maintenance manuals as routine and expected during a one-week period. If the measurement system operates within the specified performance parameters and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or adjustment other than specified above, during the 168-hour test period, the operational period will be successfully concluded. Failure of the measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a repetition of the 168-hour test period. Portions of the test which were satisfactorily completed need not be repeated. Failure to meet any performance specifications shall call for a repetition of the one-week performance test period and that portion of the testing which is related to the failed specification. All maintenance and adjustments required shall be recorded. Output readings shall be recorded before and after all adjustments.
              6.2.9 Performance Specifications Testing Frequency. In the event that significant repair work is performed in the system, the company shall demonstrate to the Administrator that the system still meets the performance specifications listed in Table I of this appendix. The Administrator may require a performance test at any time he determines that such test is necessary to verify the performance of the measurement system.

              Appendix E to Part 52—Performance Specifications and, Specification Test Procedures for Monitoring Systems for Effluent Stream Gas Volumetric Flow Rate
              1. Principle and applicability.
              
              1.1 Principle. Effluent stream gas volumetric flow rates are sampled and analyzed by a continuous measurement system. To verify the measurement system performance, values obtained from the measurement system are compared against simultaneous values obtained using the reference method. These comparison tests will be performed to determine the relative accuracy, and drift of the measurement system over the range of operating conditions expected to occur during normal operation of the source. If the measurement system is such that the specified tests in section 5.1 for drift do not apply, those test procedures shall be disregarded.
              1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable to subparts which require continuous gas volumetric flow rate measurement. Specifications are given in terms of performance. Test procedures are given for determining compliance with performance specifications.
              2. Apparatus.
              
              2.1 Continuous measurement system for determining stack gas volumetric flow rate.
              2.2 Equipment for measurement of stack gas volumetric flow rate as specified in the reference method.
              3. Definitions.
              
              3.1 Measurement system. The total equipment required for the determination of the gas volumetric flow rate in a duct or stack. The system consists of three major subsystems:
              3.1.1 Sampling interface. That portion of the measurement system that performs one or more of the following operations: Delineation, acquisition, transportation, and conditioning of a signal from the stack gas and protection of the analyzer from any hostile aspects of the source environment.
              3.1.2 Analyzer. That portion of the measurement system which senses the stack gas flow rate or velocity pressure and generates a signal output that is a function of the flow rate or velocity of the gases.
              3.1.3 Data presentation. That portion of the measurement system that provides a display of the output signal in terms of volumetric flow rate units, or other units which are convertible to volumetric flow rate units.
              3.2 Span. The value of gas volumetric flow rate at which the measurement system is set to produce the maximum data display output. For the purposes of this method, the span shall be set at 1.5 times the maximum volumetric flow rate expected under varying operating conditions of the source.
              3.3 Zero drift. The change in measurement system output over a stated period of time of normal continuous operation when gas volumetric flow rate at the time of the measurements is zero.
              3.4 Calibration drift. The change in measurement system output over a stated time period of normal continuous operation when the gas volumetric flow rate at the time of the measurement is 67 percent of the span value.
              3.5 Operation period. A minimum period of time over which a measurement system is expected to operate within certain performance specifications without unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment.
              3.6 Orientation sensitivity. The angular tolerance to which the sensor can be misaligned from its correct orientation to measure the flow rate vector before a specified error occurs in the indicated flow rate compared to the reference flow rate.
              3.7 Reference method. Method 2 as delineated in 40 CFR Part 60.
              4. Measurement system performance specifications. A measurement system must meet the performance specifications in Table E-1 to be considered acceptable under this method.

              5. Test procedures.
              
              5.1 Field test for accuracy, zero drift, calibration drift, and operation period.
              5.1.1 System conditioning. Set up and operate the measurement system in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions and drawings. Offset the zero point of the chart recorder so that negative values up to 5 percent of the span value may be registered. Operate the system for an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this initial period, the system should measure the gas stream volumetric flow rate in a normal operational manner. After completion of this conditioning period, the formal 168-hour performance and operational test period shall begin.
              5.1.2 Field test for accuracy and operational period. During the 168-hour test period, the system should be continuously measuring gas volumetric flow rate at all times. During this period make a series of 14 volumetric flow rate determinations simultaneously using the reference method and the measurement system. The 14 determinations can be made at any time interval at least one hour apart during the 168-hour period except that at least one determination on five different days must be made with one determination on the last day of such period. The determinations shall be conducted over the range of volumetric flow rates expected to occur during normal operation of the source. The measurement system volumetric flow rate reading corresponding to the period of time during which each reference method run was made may be obtained by continuous integration of the measurement system signal over the test interval. Integration may be by use of mechanical integration of electrical units on the chart recorder or use of a planimeter on the strip chart recorder. The location and orientation of the reference method measurement device and the measurement system should be as close as practical without interference, but no closer than 1.3 cm (0.5 inch) to each other and shall be such that dilution air or other interferences cannot be interjected into the stack or duct between the pitot tube and the measurement system. Be careful not to locate the reference method pitot tube directly up or down stream of the measurement system sensor.
              5.1.3 Field test for calibration drift and zero drift. At 24-hour intervals, but more frequently if recommended by the manufacturer, subject the measurement system to the manufacturer's specified zero and calibration procedures, if appropriate. Record the measurement system output readings before and after adjustment. Automatic corrections made by the system without operator intervention are allowable at anytime.
              5.1.4 Field test for orientation sensitivity. If a velocity measurement system is either a single point measurement device or a pressure sensor or any other device such as pitot tube which uses the flow direction of the test gas, then the following test shall be followed and a performance specification of ±10 degrees device orientation sensitivity for ±4 percent flow rate determination accuracy must be met in order for the measurement system to be considered acceptable under this method. This is in addition to the performance specifications given in paragraph 4 of this appendix. During a period of relatively steady state gas flow, perform the following orientation test using the measurement system. The system should be continuously measuring gas velocity at all times. Rotate the measurement 10° on each side of the direction of flow in increments of 5°. Perform this test three times each at:
              (1) Maximum operating velocity (±15 percent);
              (2) 67 percent ±7.5 percent of the maximum operating velocity; and
              (3) 33 percent ±7.5 percent of the maximum operating velocity if (2) and (3) are normal operating practices.
              6. Calculations data analysis and reporting.
              
              6.1 Procedure for determination of stack gas volumetric flow rate. Calculate the reference stack gas velocity and corresponding stack gas volumetric flow rate with the calibrated type S pitot tube measurements by the reference method. Calculate the measurement system stack gas volumetric flow rate as specified by the manufacturer's written instructions. Record the volumetric flow rates for each in the appropriate tables.
              6.2 Procedure for determination of mean values and 95 percent confidence intervals.

              6.3 Data analysis and reporting.
              
              6.3.1 Accuracy (relative). First, calculate the mean reference value (Equation E-1) of the 14 average volumetric flow rates calculated by the reference method. Second, from the 14 pairs of average volumetric flow rates calculated by the reference method and measurement system volumetric flow rate readings, calculate the mean value (Equation E-1) of the differences of the 14 paired readings. Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval (Equation E-2) using the differences of fourteen paired readings. To calculate the values in the second part of this section substitute d
                i for x
                i and d for x in Equations E-1 and E-2 where d
                i equals the difference of each paired reading and d equals the mean value of the fourteen paired differences. Third, report the sum of the absolute mean value of the differences of the fourteen paired readings and the 95 percent confidence interval of the differences of value calculated in the first part of the section. Divide this total by the mean reference value and report the result as a percentage. This percentage is the relative accuracy.
              6.3.2 Zero drift (24 hour). From the zero values measured each 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences between successive readings expressed in volumetric flow rate units. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval of these differences using Equations E-1 and E-2. Report the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the confidence interval as a percentage of the measurement system span. This percentage is the zero drift.
              6.3.3 Calibration drift (24 hour). From the calibration values measured every 24 hours during the field test calculate the differences between: (1) The calibration reading after zero and calibration adjustment, and (2) the calibration reading 24 hours later after zero adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval using Equations E-1 and E-2. Report the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and confidence interval as a percentage of the measurement system span. This percentage is the calibration drift.
              6.3.4 Operation period. Other than that clearly specified as required in the operation and maintenance manual, the measurement system shall not require any corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or adjustment during the 168-hour performance and operational test period. If the measurement system operates within the specified performance parameters and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or adjustment other than as specified above during the 168-hour test period, the operational period will be successfully concluded. Failure of the measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a repetition of the 168-hour test period. Portions of the test, except for the 168-hour field test period, which were satisfactorily completed need not be repeated. Failure to meet any performance specifications shall call for a repetition of the one-week performance test period and that portion of the testing which is related to the failed specification. All maintenance and adjustments required shall be recorded. Output readings shall be recorded before and after all adjustments.
              6.3.5 Orientation sensitivity. In the event the conditions of paragraph 5.1.4 of this appendix are required, the following calculations shall be performed. Calculate the ratio of each measurement system reading divided by the reference pitot tube readings. Graph the ratio vs. angle of deflection on each side of center. Report the points at which the ratio differs by more than ±4 percent from unity (1.00).
